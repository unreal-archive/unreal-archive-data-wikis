      <p>This directory is where the major functionality of the Unreal engine is kept.\
      \ The launchers for the game and <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\">UnrealEd</a> (of file type .exe, for computers running\
      \ a version of Windows) are both found in this folder. Other filetypes include:</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>.dll&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Compiled binaries of machine specific code, specific\
      \ to the Windows operating system.</dd>\n<dt>.u&#160;</dt>\n<dd>These are where\
      \ most of the script for the different classes is kept. It is also where various\
      \ meshes, sounds, and textures that have direct connections to these scripts\
      \ are kept.</dd>\n<dt>.int&#160;</dt>\n<dd>These files are used by the Unreal\
      \ engine for reference. Instead of searching all the packages made accessible\
      \ to it to find the resources it's looking for, it simply reads the lists of\
      \ resources contained in these files. In addition (and that's the origin of\
      \ the file extension .int for \"international\" as well), they are used for\
      \ language localization. See <a href=\"/Legacy:INT_File\" title=\"Legacy:INT\
      \ File\">INT File</a> for more information.</dd>\n<dt>.ini&#160;</dt>\n<dd>These\
      \ files are used to store information about how the game and its mods are configured.\
      \ While they can sometimes be edited manually by users, it is usually best to\
      \ edit the configurations settings directly through the game or the editor.\
      \ (However, there may occasionally be a time when this is not possible. In such\
      \ a case, this option is always open.) See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Game_Ini_File\"\

      <dd>If these files have names beginning with \"Shot\" and then followed by a\
      \ four-digit number, then this is a screenshot taken from within the game and\
      \ saved by the engine as a Bitmap image file. Once a screenshot has been taken,\
      \ it is converted to this format by the engine and then ignored, except to prevent\
      \ the engine from creating files with conflicting names. Specific to the Windows\
      \ operating system.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sounds_and_Textures\"\

      \ resources that they sound like they contain. Sounds are most often saved into\
      \ <i>.uax</i> files and put into the Sounds directory, where Textures are usually\
      \ imported into <i>.utx</i> files and saved into the Textures directory.</p>\n\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Don't use blanks or periods in package names.</b>\
      \ The engine gets confused by this. (Periods, for instance, are used as the\
      \ separator character between package and object names.)</p>\n<p>While the convention\
      \ for separating resources is used by the game's own code, it is not always\
      \ necessary to organize resources in this way. For any package that UnrealEd\
      \ can be used to create (<i>.u</i>, <i>.umx</i>, <i>.uax</i>, <i>.utx</i>, or\
      \ <i>.unr</i>), any different type of resource can be stored in this package.\
      \ The engine will only fail to locate a resource if its package is in the wrong\
      \ location for its filetype. So the Unreal engine cannot see a .uax file if\
      \ it is in the Music folder, for example. On the other hand, if ordinary sounds\
      \ were stored in a .umx file located in the Music folder, then these sounds\
      \ could be found by the engine. You can add or alter the <i>Paths</i> settings\
      \ in UnrealTournament.ini to modify that behavior.</p>\n<p>Because of this degree\
      \ of modularity, it must be understood that, ignoring the file extension, <b>two\
      \ packages cannot possess the same name</b>. For example, there cannot be both\
      \ a MyPackage.u and a MyPackage.utx, because the engine will only be able to\
      \ see one or the other of these packages, depending on which one it finds first.\
      \ In this case, it will probably find the .u file first, since the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Game_Ini_File\" title=\"Legacy:Game Ini File\">game ini file</a> is\
      \ set up to look in the System folder before the Textures folder.</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ functionality of the Unreal engine is kept.  The launchers for the game and\
      \ [[Legacy:UnrealEd|UnrealEd]] (of file type .exe, for computers running a version\
      \ of Windows) are both found in this folder.  Other filetypes include:\n; .dll\
      \ :  Compiled binaries of machine specific code, specific to the Windows operating\
      \ system. \n; .u :  These are where most of the script for the different classes\
      \ is kept.  It is also where various meshes, sounds, and textures that have\
      \ direct connections to these scripts are kept.\n; .int :  These files are used\
      \ by the Unreal engine for reference.  Instead of searching all the packages\
      \ made accessible to it to find the resources it's looking for, it simply reads\
      \ the lists of resources contained in these files.  In addition (and that's\
      \ the origin of the file extension .int for \"international\" as well), they\
      \ are used for language localization. See [[Legacy:INT File|INT File]] for more\
      \ information.\n; .ini :  These files are used to store information about how\
      \ the game and its mods are configured. While they can sometimes be edited manually\
      \ by users, it is usually best to edit the configurations settings directly\
      \ through the game or the editor.  (However, there may occasionally be a time\
      \ when this is not possible.  In such a case, this option is always open.) See\
      \ also [[Legacy:Game Ini File|game ini file]].\n; .bmp :  If these files have\
      \ names beginning with \"Shot\" and then followed by a four-digit number, then\
      \ this is a screenshot taken from within the game and saved by the engine as\
      \ a Bitmap image file.  Once a screenshot has been taken, it is converted to\
      \ this format by the engine and then ignored, except to prevent the engine from\
      \ creating files with conflicting names. Specific to the Windows operating system.\
      \ \n\n===Sounds and Textures ===\n\nThese two directories contain exactly the\
      \ types of resources that they sound like they contain.  Sounds are most often\
      \ saved into ''.uax'' files and put into the Sounds directory, where Textures\
      \ are usually imported into ''.utx'' files and saved into the Textures directory.\n\
      \n==Notes ==\n\n'''Don't use blanks or periods in package names.'''  The engine\
      \ gets confused by this.  (Periods, for instance, are used as the separator\
      \ character between package and object names.)\n\nWhile the convention for separating\
      \ resources is used by the game's own code, it is not always necessary to organize\
      \ resources in this way.  For any package that UnrealEd can be used to create\
      \ (''.u'', ''.umx'', ''.uax'', ''.utx'', or ''.unr''), any different type of\
      \ resource can be stored in this package.  The engine will only fail to locate\
      \ a resource if its package is in the wrong location for its filetype.  So the\
      \ Unreal engine cannot see a .uax file if it is in the Music folder, for example.\
      \  On the other hand, if ordinary sounds were stored in a .umx file located\
      \ in the Music folder, then these sounds could be found by the engine.  You\
      \ can add or alter the ''Paths'' settings in UnrealTournament.ini to modify\
      \ that behavior. \n\nBecause of this degree of modularity, it must be understood\
      \ that, ignoring the file extension, '''two packages cannot possess the same\
      \ name'''.  For example, there cannot be both a MyPackage.u and a MyPackage.utx,\
      \ because the engine will only be able to see one or the other of these packages,\
      \ depending on which one it finds first.  In this case, it will probably find\
      \ the .u file first, since the [[Legacy:Game Ini File|game ini file]] is set\
      \ up to look in the System folder before the Textures folder. \n\n==Related\
