      <p>For example, set the 3D viewport to show paths, hit <b>Q</b> to hide the\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP\" title=\"Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a>, and <b>W</b> to hide\
      \ static meshes. This gives a really clear overview of the <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Botpath_Network?redlink=1\"\

      \ map. The grouping is not very widely used – maybe because it brings in new\
      \ stuff to learn. (It's also buggy in early versions of UnrealEd, or at least\
      \ complex enough to seem unpredictable). However, I guarantee it is worth the\
      \ pain; especially if you are working with a complex map with lot of actors\
      \ in it.</p>\n<p>Here are some guidelines on how to make grouping a bit easier:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Precede the group names with a number and leave gaps in between so\
      \ you can add groups later in the gaps. UnrealEd shows the group list in alphabetical\
      \ order.</li>\n<li>Never let actors to belong in more than one group. Doing\
      \ this makes things confusing. (And an actor's membership of groups is stored\
      \ in a field with a limited length – this is a source of buggy behaviour when\
      \ this field's contents gets truncated.)</li>\n<li>Do not group actors by their\
      \ class hierarchy (grouping pathnodes, brushes, etc) – this would be useless\
      \ since it is already available (see above). Instead group them by their location\
      \ or use whichever seems to be more suitable. som examples might be:\n<ul>\n\
      <li>group by room, allows you to build the map one room at a time.</li>\n<li>group\
      \ by function in the game, eg red base, blue base, etc</li>\n<li>group particular\
      \ objects, eg all the lights that come from a particular type of source static\
      \ mesh</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can hide all the actors in a group\
      \ by uncchecking the box beside the group name. Alternatively, there's a toolbar\
      \ button to select all actors in the currently selected group. You can then\
      \ use the actor visibility set of buttons in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Toolbox\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Toolbox\">toolbox</a> (see above).</p>\n<p>To see grouping\
      \ in full action look at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"\

      >JB-12-Cubes</a>. It has 12 cubes (what did You expect) and these can be build\
      \ separately. This grouping speeded up the compilation a lot.</p>\n\n<!-- \n\
