      \ general proceedural questions and I'm a \"new contributor\", I'll just do\
      \ it here. Is there a convenient (or even painful, i suppose) way to generate\
      \ a list of pages that link to a specific page?</p>\n<p><b>Sweavo:</b> you can\
      \ click on the <b>Actor</b> title on the actor page for backlinks.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ Not sure if it's really convention to have a \"UT2003\" version of the pages..\
      \ I believe the convention we've been using is, the straight name refers to\
      \ the most recent incarnation of the engine, or the engine for which the most\
      \ recent information is availible. So I wouldn't think we should move Actor\
      \ to Actor (UT2003) until the next generation Unreal Engine comes out. Though,\
      \ if there's stuff changed in UT2004, that can be indicated on the page. I don't\
      \ think that a new page should be created for UT2004 though, if that's what\
      \ you were thinking.</p>\n<p>Anyways, that's just my two cents. In response\
      \ to your question, it's quite simple. The search searches the text contents\
      \ of the files that make the wiki pages, not formatted data. So, searching for\
      \ [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]] will find all pages that link to actor. Except piped\
      \ ones, which I guess you might be able to find with {| |- |Actor]] |} or something.</p>\n\
      <p>I'll warn you though, there's a lot of pages that reference Actor.&#160;:D</p>\n\
      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> Having just been told by Tarquin to not use definition lists\
      \ for anything but definitions, I find myself having to reformat this page.\
      \ After all, this is the one of the first places new people would look for proper\
      \ formatting, yes? Edit.</p>\n<p><b>Dr.AwkwArD:</b> Foxpaw -&gt; <i><b>&lt;rant&gt;</b></i>\
      \ Though present convention may be to use the unembellished name to refer to\
      \ the most current version of the tech available, I feel rather strongly that\
      \ it leads to confusion and that we really require a paradigm shift here. How\
      \ many pages using \"just the name\" are actually for the most current game/engine/build?\
      \ How many are not? Loads on both sides, right? If we begin to associate each\
      \ section/page/link with the game/engine/build for which it is valid at the\
      \ time of creation, then the effectiveness of the info will be increased (IMHO);\
      \ plus, we won't have as much to clean up later (as we do right now... like\
      \ figuring out if a page is refering to UT, UT2003,or what and then relabeling\
      \ it). As a <i>user</i> of this resource, I've been burned by this very problem\
      \ several times–and I know I'm not the only one. I acknowledge that this kind\
      \ of overhaul is an enormous undertaking, but even if we go one page, one section\
      \ at a time, it'll make the WIKI that much more useful, reliable, expedient,\
      \ trustworthy...<i><b>&lt;/rant&gt;</b></i> Phew! Anyway, thanks for the info\
      \ on searches, that'll definitely come in handy!:D</p>\n<p>SuperApe -&gt; What,\
      \ pray tell, is a \"definition list.\" And yes, this is one of the places I\
      \ came to find examples of WIKI page templates...&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ answer to questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>click title of page to generate list of\
      \ backlinks.</li>\n<li>definition list is HTML DL tag, made by&#160;;: in wiki:\
      \ read the markup page. and thanks for the layout work here&#160;;)</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> Boy, that last comment of mine is old.&#160;:D I would like\
      \ to suggest a sub-section on this page, but before I go and add it, I wanted\
      \ some input from the \"Wiki elders\":</p>\n<p><i>(see Content Ownership above)</i></p>\n\
      <p>This comes after edits made soon after page creation spur the author to accuse\
      \ the editor of stealing and vandalism. The concept of a wiki isn't unique to\
      \ this site, is it?</p>\n<p><b>Sweavo:</b> I think (uh, I'm not an elder&#160;:-)\
      \ ) that something like this might be in order. If users have registered then\
      \ all their contributions are logged and thus they are acknowledged as author.\
      \ But all authors in real publishing expect to be edited, and that's the whole\
      \ point of a wiki, not only lots of authors but lots of editors too.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ Yup. Except the wiki software we use gradually forgets a page's authors. Look\
      \ at the history of this one for example.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Does that\
      \ mean you like the Content Ownership subsection, Tarquin? Should I go ahead\
      \ and move it to the body of the page here?</p>\n<p><b>Xian:</b> Hello everyone&#160;:-)\
      \ I'm new here but I have my share of experience with UE 1 and would like to\
      \ share it to those still interested in such an old engine&#160;:-) (unfortunately\
      \ I have no clue of anything from UE 2, but I noticed there are still some things\
      \ regarding UE 1 which might need some filling up with info, thought you never\
      \ know). I was curious if copypasting code from the UT SDK (code made by EPIC)\
      \ is allowed here, as I wanted to make a few comments on a piece of code I recently\
      \ read out of boredom.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I think that if it's obvious\
      \ where the code has come from (eg it's on a class page), and it's a small piece,\
      \ then fair use applies – go for it&#160;:) And I think it's understood anyway\
      \ that when you write UnrealScript code you're going to be reusing snippets\
      \ of Epic's code, the same way you reuse pieces of maps to make new ones.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Xian:</b> just making sure nobody gets a bite out of justice with copyright\
      \ issues&#160;:) well, since you have an affinity for brushes, check out what\
      \ I'll post in the Mover section shortly and tell me what you think&#160;:)\
      \ and tnx for your reply mate!</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Moved the Content Ownership\
      \ section to the main body of the page.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>OlympusMons:</b>\
      \ Where do you post bugs on this wiki? I noticed when ever I type in a window\
      \ the edit box resizes off the screen and makes it hard to see about 1/5 of\
      \ the line. Its fine after I resize but as soon as I type its borked again.</p>\n\
      <hr />\n<p><b>Juxtapose:</b> Somewhere there should be a description of the\
      \ Summary box when editing pages. It took me a while to figure out that it only\
      \ affects the \"recent changes\" section of the given page and not the page\
      \ content itself.</p>\n<p>Also, I haven't seen anything mentioned about what\
      \ happens to your edits when you click \"Save.\" Either I have amnesia or someone\
      \ has been moving my edits stealthily.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU\

  wikitext:
    text: "This page should be a quick and easy guide to contributing to the UnrealWiki.\
      \ Ideally, it should give a newcomer enough information to get started right\
      \ away. If it doesn't, change it! Feel free to visit the [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=249\
      \ Unreal Wiki forum] if you have questions, or irc://irc.enterthegame.com/unrealwiki\n\
      \n==Quick Start ==\n\n===Background ===\n\nYou might want to read [[Legacy:Project\
      \ FAQ|Project FAQ]] or [[Legacy:Project Aims|Project Aims]] for info on the\
      \ site.\n\n===Registration (optional) ===\n\nGo to [http://www.unrealwiki.com/wiki?action=editprefs\
      \ Preferences] and give yourself a username and password. This is so your name\
      \ appears on the [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent Changes]] list; nothing else\
      \ (you don't even need an email address). The [[:Category:Legacy Personal Page]]\
      \ page has a list of all people who have contributed to the wiki; you can also\
      \ add your name to this list if you like.\n\n===Exploring ===\n\nBrowse around\
      \ the site. If you find a page you'd like to add something to, click the '''Edit\
      \ text of this page''' link at the bottom of the page. This will load up a form\
      \ containing the text of the page. Make additions or corrections and press '''Save'''.\n\
      \n===Editing Pages ===\n\nWhen editing there is a link to the markup syntax.\
      \  Use '''Preview''' to check your formatting.  Wiki has its own markup, but\
      \ it's very very simple and you can pick it up by following what's on a page\
      \ so far.  The reference page is [[Legacy:Wiki Markup|Wiki Markup]].\n\nYou\
      \ can use the [[Legacy:Sandbox|Sandbox]] page if you just want to practise editing\
      \ and markup.  You can also see examples of markup on there.\n\nThat said, don't\
      \ worry too much if you make markup errors on a page &ndash; someone else is\
      \ bound to come along and correct them. \n\nNote that the [[Legacy:Home Page|Home\
      \ Page]] is read-only to avoid people making practice edits on it.\n\n===Adding\
      \ New Material ===\n\nYou can edit existing pages to add information or ideas,\
      \ fix mistakes, or create links to other relevant pages on the wiki or elsewhere.\
      \  Before adding new material, make sure it is actually new to the wiki by doing\
      \ a thorough '''[[Legacy:Search|Search]]''' for the topic.  If you're unsure\
      \ of what name to give a new page, or you want to add something small but aren't\
      \ sure where, add it to the [[Legacy:Inbox|Inbox]], or to your own page (you\
      \ will see that when you register).  \n\nIf you spot an inaccuracy, it's much\
      \ better to correct it than to simply make a note about it.  However, do not\
      \ use guesswork to correct information, do a little bit of research or an experiment\
      \ to confirm what you are going to write.  If you know something is wrong but\
      \ do not know the right answer, it's better to do it as a note after all.\n\n\
      ===Creating Pages ===\n\nTo add a new page, first find somewhere to link from\
      \ &ndash; somewhere like [[Legacy:Mapping Lessons|Mapping Lessons]] or [[Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Tips|UnrealEd Tips]] for example. Edit that page, and in a suitable place\
      \ write the title of the page you want to add, surrounded by double square brackets\
      \ like this:<br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;<nowiki> [[Legacy:Name Of Your New Page|name\
      \ of your new page]]</nowiki></tt><br />Press ''Save''. The page will reload.\
      \ The new text will be rendered with a ''?'' link after it &ndash; this means\
      \ it's a link to page that doesn't exist yet. Clicking the link will take you\
      \ to the edit form for this new page. Write some text, press save, and the new\
      \ page is created.<br />Please don't start new pages by just typing in a URL\
      \ into your browser. Pages created like this won't be linked to anything else\
      \ in the wiki (hence they're called orphans). The idea is to build a web. Find\
      \ somewhere to link from first.\n\nMany class pages are missing from this website.\
      \ This Wiki community would appreciate it greatly if you helped add them. It's\
      \ pretty easy to create a class page, and you of course do not have to complete\
      \ it, but can leave much of it blank for other people to start. People will\
      \ be much more likely to edit and add to a class page that already exists then\
      \ to create a new one. To see a template for creating a class page, see the<br\
      \ />[[Legacy:Class_Wikifier|Class_Wikifier]]\n\n'''Note''' that admins can rename\
      \ pages: if you create a page and then it vanishes, this is probably what has\
      \ happened. Find the link you made for it  or look on [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent\
      \ Changes]]: the page name will have been updated there too. More: [[Legacy:Guidelines\
      \ On Tutorials|Guidelines On Tutorials]].\n\n===Making Rough Starts ===\n\n\
      You don't need to write an entire article for a new page. It's fine to just\
      \ make a start on something, or write what you know.  If you write a partial\
      \ article, it can be a good idea to list things you think the article should\
      \ eventually cover: You can come back to it later, and in the meantime someone\
      \ else may have made additions to the page. \n\nIt's best to start with content\
      \ rather than structure though.  If you end up creating many pages of headings\
      \ with no actual information in them it makes it harder for everyone to find\
      \ useful information on the wiki.\n\n===Don't submit material that is copyrighted...\
      \ ===\n\n...unless you have express permission. If you own the copyright (ie\
      \ if you wrote it yourself), then obviously it's fine. If you already have tutes\
      \ on the web you are very welcome to add your technological and cultural distinctiveness\
      \ to our own.\n\n===Use existing resources ===\n\nand don't reinvent the wheel.\
      \ Most simple tasks are explained on [[:Category:Legacy Basic Procedure]] pages:\
      \ you can link to those from tutorials.\n\n===Content Ownership===\n\nThe content\
      \ submitted to the wiki does not belong to the author.  It is not the personal\
      \ property of anyone, but rather the \"ownership\" belongs to all wiki users.\
      \  As a wiki, it's content is subject to change by any other wiki user.  Hopefully\
      \ this change is for the better, as it usually is.  But, please do not take\
      \ personal offense to edits on a page you've created.  The edits or changes\
      \ made were most likely made in the spirit of making the wiki better; more inclusive,\
      \ more reference-like, more generalized, more linkable, more useful.  If you\
      \ have a question or comment about the changes made, make your thoughts heard\
      \ in the Discussion section at the bottom of the page.\n\n==Community ==\n\n\
      (brief notes...) Checking [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent Changes]] is part of\
      \ the responsibilities of being a good Wikizen:\n* check for vandalism, \n*\
      \ see what other people have written and help out if you can, \n* check if you\
      \ have messages, \n* check what people have been doing on pages you've worked\
      \ on recently\n\nIf you've got a minute to spare, take a look at [[Legacy:UnrealWiki\
      \ To Do|UnrealWiki To Do]]\n\n==What Next? ==\n* You can create a [[:Category:Legacy\
      \ Personal Page|personal page]] for yourself, and get a smug sense of satisfaction\
      \ at the increasing number of people who are working together on the project.\n\
      * [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent Changes]] is the nerve center of the site.\
      \ It's what the hive mind is currently thinking about. It's also rather a large\
      \ page, so you may want to change the number of displayed days in your Preferences.\
      \ It's also where important news about the site is posted.\n\n==See Also ==\n\

      \ BeyondUnreal's General Editing Forum].\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''Dr.AwkwArD:'''\
      \ Since I have no idea where to ask general proceedural questions and I'm a\
      \ \"new contributor\", I'll just do it here.  Is there a convenient (or even\
      \ painful, i suppose) way to generate a list of pages that link to a specific\
      \ page? \n\n'''Sweavo:''' you can click on the '''Actor''' title on the actor\
      \ page for backlinks.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Not sure if it's really convention to\
      \ have a \"UT2003\" version of the pages.. I believe the convention we've been\
      \ using is, the straight name refers to the most recent incarnation of the engine,\
      \ or the engine for which the most recent information is availible. So I wouldn't\
      \ think we should move Actor to Actor (UT2003) until the next generation Unreal\
      \ Engine comes out. Though, if there's stuff changed in UT2004, that can be\
      \ indicated on the page. I don't think that a new page should be created for\
      \ UT2004 though, if that's what you were thinking.\n\nAnyways, that's just my\
      \ two cents. In response to your question, it's quite simple. The search searches\
      \ the text contents of the files that make the wiki pages, not formatted data.\
      \ So, searching for <nowiki>[[Legacy:Actor|Actor]]</nowiki> will find all pages\
      \ that link to actor. Except piped ones, which I guess you might be able to\
      \ find with <nowiki>{|\n\n|-\n|Actor]]\n|}\n</nowiki> or something.\n\nI'll\
      \ warn you though, there's a lot of pages that reference Actor. :D\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ Having just been told by Tarquin to not use definition lists for anything\
      \ but definitions, I find myself having to reformat this page.  After all, this\
      \ is the one of the first places new people would look for proper formatting,\
      \ yes?  Edit.\n\n'''Dr.AwkwArD:''' Foxpaw -> '''''<rant>''''' Though present\
      \ convention may be to use the unembellished name to refer to the most current\
      \ version of the tech available, I feel rather strongly that it leads to confusion\
      \ and that we really require a paradigm shift here.  How many pages using \"\
      just the name\" are actually for the most current game/engine/build?  How many\
      \ are not?  Loads on both sides, right?  If we begin to associate each section/page/link\
      \ with the game/engine/build for which it is valid at the time of creation,\
      \ then the effectiveness of the info will be increased (IMHO); plus, we won't\
      \ have as much to clean up later (as we do right now... like figuring out if\
      \ a page is refering to UT, UT2003,or what and then relabeling it).  As a ''user''\
      \ of this resource, I've been burned by this very problem several times&ndash;and\
      \ I know I'm not the only one.  I acknowledge that this kind of overhaul is\
      \ an enormous undertaking, but even if we go one page, one section at a time,\
      \ it'll make the WIKI that much more useful, reliable, expedient, trustworthy...'''''</rant>'''''\
      \ Phew! Anyway, thanks for the info on searches, that'll definitely come in\
      \ handy!:D\n\nSuperApe -> What, pray tell, is a \"definition list.\"  And yes,\
      \ this is one of the places I came to find examples of WIKI page templates...\
      \ :)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' answer to questions: \n* click title of page to generate\
      \ list of backlinks. \n* definition list is HTML DL tag, made by ;: in wiki:\
      \ read the markup page. and thanks for the layout work here ;)\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ Boy, that last comment of mine is old. :D  I would like to suggest a sub-section\
      \ on this page, but before I go and add it, I wanted some input from the \"\
      Wiki elders\": \n\n''(see Content Ownership above)''\n\nThis comes after edits\
      \ made soon after page creation spur the author to accuse the editor of stealing\
      \ and vandalism.  The concept of a wiki isn't unique to this site, is it?\n\n\
      '''Sweavo:''' I think (uh, I'm not an elder :-) ) that something like this might\
      \ be in order.  If users have registered then all their contributions are logged\
      \ and thus they are acknowledged as author.  But all authors in real publishing\
      \ expect to be edited, and that's the whole point of a wiki, not only lots of\
      \ authors but lots of editors too.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Yup. Except the wiki software\
      \ we use gradually forgets a page's authors. Look at the history of this one\
      \ for example.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Does that mean you like the Content Ownership\
      \ subsection, Tarquin?  Should I go ahead and move it to the body of the page\
      \ here?\n\n'''Xian:''' Hello everyone :-) I'm new here but I have my share of\
      \ experience with UE 1 and would like to share it to those still interested\
      \ in such an old engine :-) (unfortunately I have no clue of anything from UE\
      \ 2, but I noticed there are still some things regarding UE 1 which might need\
      \ some filling up with info, thought you never know). I was curious if copypasting\
      \ code from the UT SDK (code made by EPIC) is allowed here, as I wanted to make\
      \ a few comments on a piece of code I recently read out of boredom.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ I think that if it's obvious where the code has come from (eg it's on a class\
      \ page), and it's a small piece, then fair use applies &ndash; go for it :)\
      \ And I think it's understood anyway that when you write UnrealScript code you're\
      \ going to be reusing snippets of Epic's code, the same way you reuse pieces\
      \ of maps to make new ones.\n\n'''Xian:''' just making sure nobody gets a bite\
      \ out of justice with copyright issues :) well, since you have an affinity for\
      \ brushes, check out what I'll post in the Mover section shortly and tell me\
      \ what you think :) and tnx for your reply mate!\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Moved the\
      \ Content Ownership section to the main body of the page.\n\n----\n\n'''OlympusMons:'''\
      \ Where do you post bugs on this wiki? I noticed when ever I type in a window\
      \ the edit box resizes off the screen and makes it hard to see about 1/5 of\
      \ the line. Its fine after I resize but as soon as I type its borked again.\n\
      \n----\n\n'''Juxtapose:''' Somewhere there should be a description of the Summary\
      \ box when editing pages. It took me a while to figure out that it only affects\
      \ the \"recent changes\" section of the given page and not the page content\
      \ itself.\n\nAlso, I haven't seen anything mentioned about what happens to your\
      \ edits when you click \"Save.\" Either I have amnesia or someone has been moving\
      \ my edits stealthily."
