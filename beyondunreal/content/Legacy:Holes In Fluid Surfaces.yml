      \ of many ways to do this. For the example i'm just using this quick example\
      \ map</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_fluidsurfacealpha1.jpeg\"\

      \ the detail of the FSI atm, and i don't feel like restarting :p.  \n</pre>\n\
      <p>In the top viewport, zoom in/out and pan so u get the FSI just about in the\
      \ middle, but make sure you can see the whole FSI in the viewport. now hit \"\
      Print Screen\" on the keyboard. now open your 2d program of choice, and open\
      \ your texture you'll be using for the water (assuming your using a custom texture,\
      \ if not you can just make the alpha texture, then apply as an opacity mask\
      \ later). I'll be using photoshop 7. Create a new layer and Ctrl + V (paste),\
      \ which should paste in your top view that you took w/ the printscreen button.\
      \ Now carefully select the OUTLINE of the FSI. Then resize it so it's flush\
      \ w/ the canvas</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"\

      \ /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>Create a new layer, and paint the parts you want\
      \ to be invisible PURE black, and the parts you want to be completely visible\
      \ PURE white, and anything you want semi-visible, paint a shade of gray (darker\
      \ = more transparent). Now make sure this is all on one layer, press ctrl +\
      \ A (select all), and then Ctrl + C (copy).</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div\

      \ partially visible w/ some noise to give it a slight variance in opacity, and\
      \ the inner ring &amp; outside completely invisible. Now find the Channels tab/menu,\
      \ and add Alpha Channel, then Ctrl + V (paste) it in there. Go back to the Layers\
      \ tab/menu and delete all the extra layers except for the base texture,</p>\n\

      \ width=\"645\" height=\"453\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>then save it out as\
      \ dds (or other supported format w/ alpha channels), and make sure Alpha Channels\
      \ are on when you save it out. Then go back into UED, open texture browser,\
      \ File / import, find the texture you saved, setup the packages etc. (use myLevel\
      \ for package if you don't want to save a custom package), and check \"Alpha\"\
      , and it should look something like this after you apply it:</p>\n<div class=\"\

      \ have tiling set to 1 on the FSI). Forgive me if I forgot or got anything wrong,\
      \ this is my first tut, and I'm sure someone could &amp; has done a tutorial\
