      \ a copy of Unreal Tournament 2004. Make sure Unreal Tournament is patched to\
      \ the latest version (3339). Double click the \"client\" installer to install\
      \ Esc. Always use the Esc shortcut or Start menu to start Esc, since this starts\
      \ up the EscDaemon which does the music streaming. Then join a multiplayer server,\
      \ just like you do in Unreal Tournament 2004. That's it!</p>\n<p>Esc Flagship\
      \ Server: I've left MIT, so it's sporatic at best. But you can try 209.6.112.159</p>\n\
      <p>To dance, hit the \"toggle dance mode\" key (default: o). The camera will\
      \ switch to an external, third person view, and red arrows should appear on\
      \ the screen. You need to hit the given arrow key on the beat of the music–\
      when the arrow flashes. Right click to switch to \"pointer mode\" where you\
      \ can scroll back the chat, send msgs to people, buy things, etc.</p>\n<h4><span\

      <p>Dancing is the <i>raison d'être</i> for Esc - therefore it helps if you know\
      \ your 'Toggle Dance Mode' key - this will switch between the standard interface,\
      \ and the Dance Mode.</p>\n<p>If you wish to dance, are in 'Dance Mode' yet\
      \ hear no music - you are either downloading the music, or there is no 'MusicSource'\
      \ near you in the level. Read the FAQ list for solutions to these problems.</p>\n\

      <p>Their are many reasons you might start an Esc server - perhaps you are hosting\
      \ your own club online, or perhaps you are just hosting so you can hang out\
      \ privately with your friends. There are two ways to start an Esc server - standard\
      \ method, and advanced.</p>\n<p>This is a little more tricky. You'll need:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Your own music. The auto tempo finder needs a strong beat, although\
      \ you can experiment.</li>\n<li>An Icecast stream, which you can create using:</li>\n\
      <li>Winamp 2.91 or later, or Winamp 5 (but not Winamp 3) Comes with the server\
      \ version of Esc, or get it at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"\
      http://www.winamp.com\">http://www.winamp.com</a></li>\n<li>Oddcast plugin for\
      \ Winamp 2, v. 2.0.5 or later. You don't need the \"LAME encoder dll.\" Comes\
      \ with the server version of Esc, or get it at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external free\" href=\"http://www.oddsock.org/tools/oddcastv2_wa2\">http://www.oddsock.org/tools/oddcastv2_wa2</a></li>\n\
      <li>Icecast2 win32 v. 2.0 from June 18, 2003 (i.e.Icecast2_win32_2.0_06182003_setup.exe)\
      \ or later. Comes with the server version of Esc, or get it from <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.oddsock.org/tools/icecast2/\">http://www.oddsock.org/tools/icecast2/</a></li>\n\
      <li>A Windows UT2004 server with Esc installed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>1. (First time\
      \ only) Configure Winamp:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(optional, only for WinAmp 2) Doublesize\
      \ winamp: In the main Winamp window (the one with the play, stop, etc. buttons)\
      \ click on the small D along the left hand side. That will make the window double\
      \ size, so unless your computer is running in DOOM resolution, it'll make your\
      \ life easier.</li>\n<li>Get Winamp to use alt volume control: Bring up the\
      \ Winamp preferences window, e.g. by hitting CTRL-P. On the left, under plug-ins,\
      \ click \"output.\" On the right, click \"waveOut output,\" then click \"configure.\"\
      \ In the window that pops up, in the bottom \"volume control\" section, make\
      \ sure \"alt. setting method (slow)\" is selected. Then click Ok. This allows\
      \ you to turn the WinAmp volume all the way down, but still hear the music in\
      \ other applications, including Esc.</li>\n<li>Open the oddcast window: In the\
      \ Winamp preferences window, on the left, under plug-ins, click DSP/Effect.\
      \ Click on \"oddcast DSP v2.\" The oddcast window pops up. You can move it somewhere\
      \ more conveient (like near the rest of winamp) and close the preferences window.</li>\n\
      <li>Configure oddcast: In the oddcast DSP window, click \"config.\" The \"Edit\
      \ Config\" window pops up. In \"General,\" set the Sample Rate to 22050, the\
      \ Channels to 1, and the Encoder Type to OGG. In the \"Encode\" tab, click the\
      \ \"OggVorbis\" tab, encoding type \"quality,\" Quality level 0. In the Server\
      \ tab, set ServerType to Icecast2, server = localhost, port = 8000. Choose an\
      \ encoder password and remember it. Mountpoint = /spanky.ogg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.\
      \ (First time only) Configure Icecast2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start up Icecast2 and\
      \ select Configuration-&gt;Edit Configuration. The only thing you need to change\
      \ is the \"source password.\" Make this the same as the \"encoder password\"\
      \ you chose above. Save and exit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3. (First time only) Tell\
      \ Esc where your Icecast2 server is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some day there'll be a way\
      \ to do this in the Esc menu, but for now, you have to edit a configuration\
      \ file by hand. Open up C:\\UT2004\\Esc\\System\\Esc.ini, or if that doesn't\
      \ exist, C:\\UT2004\\Esc\\System\\default.ini, and near the bottom you'll see:</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>[EscMusic.EscMusicSource]</p>\n<p>ConfigURL=<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external free\" href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/spanky.ogg\">http://127.0.0.1:8000/spanky.ogg</a></p>\n\
      <p>Change the \"127.0.0.1\" to the IP address of the machine that your Icecast2\
      \ server is running on. The Icecast2 server can be running on a different machine\
      \ than your UT server.</p>\n<p>4. Start the server</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start Icecast2\
      \ and click \"Start Server.\"</li>\n<li>Start Winamp, start playing your music,\
      \ then (in the Oddcast DSP window) click \"connect\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now start\
      \ up a level. If it's an Esc level, it will already have a MusicSource and in\
      \ a few seconds you should see a song name. If you head to the dance floor,\
      \ you should hear the music 10 seconds later. And anyone who joins your game\
      \ will connect to your Icecast server, and they'll hear it too.</p>\n<p>If it's\
      \ a regular old UT level, you can type \"music\" in the console to place a music\
      \ source where you're standing.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Advanced_Server_Stuff\"\

      \ Start menu to start Esc, since this starts up the EscDaemon which does the\
      \ music streaming.  Then join a multiplayer server, just like you do in Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2004.  That's it!\n\nEsc Flagship Server: I've left MIT, so it's\
      \ sporatic at best.  But you can try 209.6.112.159\n\nTo dance, hit the \"toggle\
      \ dance mode\" key (default: o).  The camera will switch to an external, third\
      \ person view, and red arrows should appear on the screen.  You need to hit\
      \ the given arrow key on the beat of the music&ndash;when the arrow flashes.\
      \  Right click to switch to \"pointer mode\" where you can scroll back the chat,\
      \ send msgs to people, buy things, etc.\n\n==== Things To Remember =====\n\n\
      Dancing is the ''raison d'être'' for Esc - therefore it helps if you know your\
      \ 'Toggle Dance Mode' key - this will switch between the standard interface,\
      \ and the Dance Mode. \n\nIf you wish to dance, are in 'Dance Mode' yet hear\
      \ no music - you are either downloading the music, or there is no 'MusicSource'\
      \ near you in the level.  Read the FAQ list for solutions to these problems.\n\
      \n====Starting Your Own Server ====\n\nTheir are many reasons you might start\
      \ an Esc server - perhaps you are hosting your own club online, or perhaps you\
      \ are just hosting so you can hang out privately with your friends.  There are\
      \ two ways to start an Esc server - standard method, and advanced.\n\nThis is\
      \ a little more tricky.  You'll need:\n\n* Your own music.  The auto tempo finder\
      \ needs a strong beat, although you can experiment.\n* An Icecast stream, which\
      \ you can create using:\n* Winamp 2.91 or later, or Winamp 5 (but not Winamp\
      \ 3)  Comes with the server version of Esc, or get it at http://www.winamp.com\n\
      * Oddcast plugin for Winamp 2, v. 2.0.5 or later.  You don't need the \"LAME\
      \ encoder dll.\"  Comes with the server version of Esc, or get it at http://www.oddsock.org/tools/oddcastv2_wa2\n\
      * Icecast2 win32 v. 2.0 from June 18, 2003 (i.e.Icecast2_win32_2.0_06182003_setup.exe)\
      \ or later.  Comes with the server version of Esc, or get it from http://www.oddsock.org/tools/icecast2/\n\
      * A Windows UT2004 server with Esc installed.\n\n1. (First time only) Configure\
      \ Winamp:\n* (optional, only for WinAmp 2) Doublesize winamp: In the main Winamp\
      \ window (the one with the play, stop, etc. buttons) click on the small D along\
      \ the left hand side.  That will make the window double size, so unless your\
      \ computer is running in DOOM resolution, it'll make your life easier.\n* Get\
      \ Winamp to use alt volume control: Bring up the Winamp preferences window,\
      \ e.g. by hitting CTRL-P.  On the left, under plug-ins, click \"output.\"  On\
      \ the right, click \"waveOut output,\" then click \"configure.\"  In the window\
      \ that pops up, in the bottom \"volume control\" section, make sure \"alt. setting\
      \ method (slow)\" is selected.  Then click Ok.  This allows you to turn the\
      \ WinAmp volume all the way down, but still hear the music in other applications,\
      \ including Esc.\n* Open the oddcast window: In the Winamp preferences window,\
      \ on the left, under plug-ins, click DSP/Effect.  Click on \"oddcast DSP v2.\"\
      \  The oddcast window pops up.  You can move it somewhere more conveient (like\
      \ near the rest of winamp) and close the preferences window.\n* Configure oddcast:\
      \ In the oddcast DSP window, click \"config.\"  The \"Edit Config\" window pops\
      \ up.  In \"General,\" set the Sample Rate to 22050, the Channels to 1, and\
      \ the Encoder Type to OGG.  In the \"Encode\" tab, click the \"OggVorbis\" tab,\
      \ encoding type \"quality,\" Quality level 0.  In the Server tab, set ServerType\
      \ to Icecast2, server = localhost, port = 8000.  Choose an encoder password\
      \ and remember it.  Mountpoint = /spanky.ogg\n\n2. (First time only) Configure\
      \ Icecast2:\n* Start up Icecast2 and select Configuration->Edit Configuration.\
      \  The only thing you need to change is the \"source password.\"  Make this\
      \ the same as the \"encoder password\" you chose above.  Save and exit.\n\n\
      3. (First time only) Tell Esc where your Icecast2 server is:\n* Some day there'll\
      \ be a way to do this in the Esc menu, but for now, you have to edit a configuration\
      \ file by hand.  Open up C:\\UT2004\\Esc\\System\\Esc.ini, or if that doesn't\
      \ exist, C:\\UT2004\\Esc\\System\\default.ini, and near the bottom you'll see:\n\
      \n[EscMusic.EscMusicSource]\n\nConfigURL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/spanky.ogg\n\n\
      Change the \"127.0.0.1\" to the IP address of the machine that your Icecast2\
      \ server is running on.  The Icecast2 server can be running on a different machine\
      \ than your UT server.\n\n4. Start the server\n* Start Icecast2 and click \"\
      Start Server.\"\n* Start Winamp, start playing your music, then (in the Oddcast\
      \ DSP window) click \"connect\"\n\nNow start up a level.  If it's an Esc level,\
      \ it will already have a MusicSource and in a few seconds you should see a song\
      \ name.  If you head to the dance floor, you should hear the music 10 seconds\
      \ later.  And anyone who joins your game will connect to your Icecast server,\
      \ and they'll hear it too.\n\nIf it's a regular old UT level, you can type \"\
      music\" in the console to place a music source where you're standing.\n\n===Advanced\
      \ Server Stuff ===\n\n-If your server is behind a router or firewall, you need\
      \ to open up the standard UT ports (7777 to 7788 UDP, and maybe 27900 & 27902\
      \ TCP as well?) plus the icecast port, 8000 TCP.-\n\n====Credits ====\n* DJPaul,\

      ====LAST WORDS ====\n\n'''We need you!'''\n\nWe'd be thrilled if you could come\
      \ forward and offer your services - coders, mappers, animators, texture artists,\
      \ musicians, general 1337 people would be more than appreciated.  Best email\
      \ the boss. \n\n'''Note from MC|Spanky'''\n\nIf you've read this far (well done):\
      \ What the hell are you doing?? Go join an Esc server!  \n\n----\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \  questions about the installer: \n# is there any reason why it's an EXE and\
      \ not a UMOD?\n##'''DJP:''' 'Cos this is nicer - as we might (can't remember\
      \ offhand) make copies of the user's user.ini/ut.ini files, and use those for\
      \ Esc.  UMODs, in my experiance, are pinniky beasts.\n### downside is it's not\
      \ cross-platform...\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  That's a big downside, especially if\
      \ the rest of the mod would otherwise be platform-independent (see also [[Legacy:Mychaeel/Modding\
      \ Etiquette|Mychaeel/Modding Etiquette]]).  And I'm actually not sure whether\
      \ you can or can't do things like copying files with UMod installers; they're\
      \ by far more powerful than [[Legacy:Umod Wizard|umod Wizard]] suggests.\n\n\
      # what's it going to do to my UT folder? I'm wary of letting things loose on\
      \ existing applications. A quick summary in the installer info itself would\
      \ be nice if there's anything beyond the usual Unreal packages (eg overwriting\
      \ existing files...)\n##'''DJP:''' No files should be overwritten - be less\
      \ scared, tarquin.\n### I'll give it a try later :)\n\n'''Mcspanky:'''  The\
      \ mod isn't plaform independent, unfortunately.  It needs to call DirectSound\
      \ to play the music for a number of reasons.  So, until we can get some Mac/Linux\
      \ sound programmers interested, it's Windows only.  If anybody's done sound\
      \ programming under either one, porting Esc wouldn't be hard, and would be a\
      \ BIG help...\n[[Category:Legacy FAQ|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
