      \ of tasks include basic human behavior such as hunting, gathering, exploring,\
      \ trading, and nurturing. In a first-person-shooter like Unreal, the most obvious\
      \ tasks are hunting and exploring, but examples of item gathering and trading\
      \ (weapons throwing) are common. An example of nurturing is the energizing of\
      \ ONS power nodes in UT2004. More complex tasks like puzzle solving can involve\
      \ a series of simpler tasks building towards a defined goal.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ to help achieve a goal. The overall goal or objective in a game should be\
      \ very clear. Lesser goals can be less obvious and left for players to discover\
      \ as strategies. The buildup of lesser goals towards a larger SuperGoal will\
      \ help players feel more engaged and satisfied with the tasks they've performed.</p>\n\
