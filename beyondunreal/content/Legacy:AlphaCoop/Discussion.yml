    text: "<p><b>Mosquito:</b> The map of your REALLY is screaming for a vehicle,\
      \ its just so freakin' big. Also, there's not path nodes for bots, making computer\
      \ teammates as usefull as a wet clam. I actually liked the ending bit, But I\
      \ expected a big showdown with a mega queen in the bottom, not some loppy rockthrowers,\
      \ The bridge bit's elevators are seriously broken, and the door for the \"SURROUNDED\"\
      \ section is unlockible, I had to use a translocator to bypass it, and the fly\
      \ cheat for the bridge. The weapons selection was questionable. No lightning\
      \ gun or minigun? They'd work very well for the setup.</p>\n<p>And in other\
      \ news, my Moria map is coming very.. very... VERY slowly, considering I can't\
      \ properly compile lighting and distance fog is non-functional, I think I'll\
      \ just carve out a basic BSP level for now to use for testing in this mod, then\
      \ when I get my new rig, add all the pretty.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> Wow, thats\
      \ a whole bunch for the feedback. Here is what I have to say in return:</p>\n\
      <p>-no vehicles for this mod. It would just ruin the fun of fighting the monsters\
      \ up close. It would be too boring to just be able to ram all the monsters.\
      \ Yes I know my map is way to big, but what can you do? Its just a test map.\
      \ I'm not even a mapper. Hehehehe.-</p>\n<p>- That leads to the next point -\
      \ since its a test map, I generally don't care if its all perfect and such.\
      \ Thus I'm not gonna pay much attention to the path nodes. I just care that\
      \ my code works.</p>\n<p>-Thats true, the ending should be better. Once again,\
      \ I was just testing my triggers and such. I'm also planning on coding special\
      \ oversized verisons of the monster to be used as bosses and for the arena gametype.-</p>\n\
      <p>-btw, why don't you like the titans?? They are the coolest monsters in unreal!-</p>\n\
      <p>- the elevators are not broken, you just have to have more than one person\
      \ to make it work - that was the idea.</p>\n<p>-the 'surrounded' door is not\
      \ working because I forgot to fix the roundrobin which activates it-</p>\n<p>-\
      \ weapons selection is another thing. I just choose the most used ones. I didn't\
      \ bother taking the time to custom fit them for all areas, since the monsters\
      \ are kind of randomly choosen anyways - it would be pointless unless I spawn\
      \ specific monsters with a reason behind it. Giving all weapons is also not\
      \ an option - I'd like to keep the gameplay consistent.</p>\n<p>Good to hear\
      \ that you are working on a map:) Its even better than you decided to do the\
      \ layout/bsp first, which is far more important than eyecandy.</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b>\
      \ I'm an old style UT mapper, so nearly 70% of my candy sweetiness is in my\
      \ lighting&#160;:(. Also, Titans Seem to have a thing for being slaughtered\
      \ by Skraaj, Is there a way to set teams for the monsters? The phrase; \"They\
      \ have a cave Troll!\" isn't as impressive when the troll turns around to get\
      \ butchered by its comrade orcs.</p>\n<p>Your map with alittle TLC could be\
      \ a very awsome level, It would need a serious mofit facelift, but it could\
      \ be very awsome. feel free to code a Balrog for me, A big mean firey balrog,\
      \ Attach Smoke and flame emitters to the Warlord, give a flamethrower and a\
      \ mean slash attack, scale him up afew times and slow him down and he'd be perfect.\
      \ I'm still thinking of a way I could script the balrog to step on the bridge\
      \ when he's out of health to fall to his demise. And SniperSkraaj with arrows,\
      \ and another type with only melee would be nice too... (the shield thing fits\
      \ perfectly with the LOTR thing)</p>\n<p>oohh! And a redhead, with big breasts,\
      \ really easy, I'd prefer a virgin, really naive, not to skinny or fat.. And\
      \ some fries. thanks.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b></p>\n<p>-Yes, I can change the\
      \ monster's species so they can decide to fight each other, or not.-</p>\n<p>-I\
      \ dunno if I have the time, ideas, creativity, and the ability to do the mofit\
      \ facelift...I'd rather focus on the code so that your maps can benefit from\
      \ it!-</p>\n<p>-I'll get to the monsters, when... I'll get to the monsters&#160;;)-</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mosquito:</b> I really didn't notice the lack of a specialevent actor\
      \ until now! Why'd they take out that useful trigger, arg! My work around for\
      \ the cave troll is to have the team need to kill all the skraaj snipers before\
      \ facing the troll. I hope you can enable a squad function in a future release.</p>\n\
      <p>Update: I just played the tomb section of my Moria map, Might shit is it\
      \ hard, the minigun is in the center of the room, with health and ammo on the\
      \ side upper areas on it, because of the dozen or so SniperSkraaj that attack\
      \ you, its a frantic dance around the level just shooting that these guys, which\
      \ a problem arose (Note: when you shot a SniperSkraaj while he has his shield\
      \ up, he still bleeds, confusing players) and I found myself relying lots of\
      \ grenades and using the shield function of the shieldgun, (I think the shield\
      \ should be implemented gameplaywise in a more important and useful fashion\
      \ in AC). Because of the incredible close quarters of the room, the titan only\
      \ need take afew steps to be in striking range. So far, this map with hit home\
      \ with LOTR and haters alike... now only If I can fix this lighting problem,\
      \ right now I have very VERY ugly standin lights to light up the meshes, so\
      \ I don't need to use RMODE 6 all the time.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> What do\
      \ you mean by enable the '...enable a squad function'?</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b>\
      \ To set teams, so you could have a group of Skaarj fight another group of Skaarj.</p>\n\
      <p><b>AlphaOne:</b> Oh, ok. Maybe tomorrow.</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> I've got\
      \ a full afternoon ahead of me, I might beable to finish moria today, layout\
      \ wise.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> Sweet!</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> These glitches\
      \ that are effecting my UED are really making this map a totally pain, and complete\
      \ mess, I'm considering just dropping it all together and wait till I have a\
      \ rig that can handle UED.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> Thats fine, no pressure.\
      \ After all, you signed up to help me. You don't owe me anything. Plus, I haven't\
      \ done much myself. I got nuf real life problems. Tell me what your problem\
      \ with UED is. Are you editing terrain? If so, don't edit the very edges of\
      \ it! \\o/ Just a friendly warning: if you don't get good fps in the editor,\
      \ that means the map has too many polygons. Might be time to consider if they\
      \ are all actually necessary&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> No compiling of\
      \ lighting on BSP surfaces, messed up distance fog, complete breakdown of the\
      \ whole concept of x Event triggers actor with x tag, etc. Just all round asshatery\
      \ that no one else on the planet has an issue with, hence no support. (it wasn't\
      \ always like this either, it just happened out of the blue, no hardware change,\
      \ now software change, nothing, drivers don't fix it, patches don't fix it,\
      \ reinstalls, multiple installiations... all that there is left to do it to\
      \ reformat, but I can't do that... So arggh!</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> errr...\
      \ check Planetunreal.com, seems Alpha has doing public.... errrr? What? This\
      \ isn't anywhere near a public release, I think someone slipped out the word,\
      \ I highly recommend getting that off PU before the spammers of hell start ripping\
      \ up this page.</p>\n<p><b>AlphOne:</b> No worries. I did it myself and I had\
      \ some good reasons for that.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>Hope you don't\
      \ mind me butting in like this but .... I've been thinking about your desire\
      \ to encourage teamwork within your maps. You have to be really careful with\
      \ that. I thought of one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to cross a large draw bridge.\
      \ There are switches to raise and lower the drawbridge on either side. The bridge\
      \ starts in the \"up\" position. In order to lower the bridge you have to get\
      \ into the gatehouse and find the switch/lever/trigger. The thing is, there\
      \ are monsters spawning on the other side of the bridge that will start the\
      \ drawbridge raising again should a player start to lower it. You can't see\
      \ the other side of the bridge from within the gatehouse so you need half your\
      \ team sniping monsters on the other side of the water/lava-lake/chasm/etc and\
      \ the other half to get into the gate house and lower the bridge.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>There are real problems with this level of co-operation in that on pubs you\
      \ may not have a chance to get things together enough to actually finish the\
      \ level. The one thing in your favour is that the whole mod will be emphasising\
      \ teamwork so people will expect to have to work together. I've built similar\
      \ stuff in the past and people have hated the co-op aspect. Personally I think\
      \ it rocks. Anyways - is that the level of co-op you were aiming for?</p>\n\
      <p><b>AlphaOne:</b> Yes, thats exactly it! LOL How did you know?&#160;:) I just\
      \ need some mappers to execute it properly. However, I might as well making\
      \ up (designing) coop scenario ideas because I REALLY DO suck at mapping.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Enos:</b> Every once in a while randomly browsing forums pays off. Ive\
      \ been hoping that someone would make a co-op mod like sven co-op for HL, and\
      \ here i find out someone is. I map, im not fantastic, but im not a complete\
      \ newbie. If theres any way that i can help out, id be more then happy to. To\
      \ Entropic: Ive thought of that same sort of scenario for an assault map, but\
      \ i dont know how it could be implemented without custom scripting that i dont\
      \ understand. The problem is since movers move between keyframes, you cant have\
      \ one trigger that say moves the bridge from key 0 to 1, and another for the\
      \ monsters to use that moves it between keys 1 to 0. Im not putting down your\
      \ idea, it would be excellent, im just not sure how it could be executed.</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> I'd custom script it. Glad the original page was restored\
      \ after the bit of vandalism it received.</p>\n<p><b>veryhappy:</b> I'd created\
      \ a mover for UT that can be pushed in the two ways,i mean if you are near a\
      \ button it will go go n -&gt; n+1 if you are near another button it will go\
      \ n+1-&gt;n (where n is the numbre of keys).I'd made it customizable so you\
      \ can jump to the 0-&gt; latest key or latest key-&gt;0 if you like.I'd lose\
      \ all the work when i formated my PC but i think i can redo it for UT2004 without\
      \ a lot of work(I hope)</p>\n<p><b>veryhappy:</b> It's more dificult than it\
      \ was in UT.I must create a new trigger to send a custom event to the mover,\
      \ the mover itself and learn a bit of mapping things&#160;:/.I think i can't\
      \ do this at least till August (I've to study a lot).I was thinking about that\
      \ and I'd an idea: Put a button in a sub that trigger the mover that way the\
      \ player that push the button can't reach the mover so they must cooperate to\
      \ go to the other side of the abyss&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Plouj:</b> I added some\
      \ vague ideas. What do you think?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Mosquito?:</b>Alpha, you\
      \ still working on this? with my new rig I've been hungering to work on a project.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Plouj:</b> Righ now I'm not working on anything, but if anyone wants to\
      \ continue AC, go ahead, I'll be glad to see that happen. Obviously my work/ides\
      \ should remain credited as mine.</p>\n<p><b>Plouj:</b> Added a link to the\
      \ source <a href=\"/Legacy:AlphaCoop\" title=\"Legacy:AlphaCoop\">AlphaCoop</a>\
      \ if anyone wants to continue it.</p>\n<p><b>Enos Shenk:</b> If anyone takes\
      \ up development on this, i would be more then happy to map for it. If i could\
      \ comprehend object-oriented code in the slightest, i miht have a go at it.</p>\n\
      <p><b>lincore:</b> Could someone post a link to the source? The one on <a href=\"\

      \ im just not sure how it could be executed.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' I'd custom\
      \ script it.  Glad the original page was restored after the bit of vandalism\
      \ it received.\n\n'''veryhappy:''' I'd created a mover for UT that can be pushed\
      \ in the two ways,i mean if you are near a button it will go go n -> n+1 if\
      \ you are near another button it will go n+1->n (where n is the numbre of keys).I'd\
      \ made it customizable so you can jump to the 0-> latest key or latest key->0\
      \ if you like.I'd lose all the work when i formated my PC but i think i can\
      \ redo it for UT2004 without a lot of work(I hope)\n\n'''veryhappy:''' It's\
      \ more dificult than it was in UT.I must create a new trigger to send a custom\
      \ event to the mover, the mover itself and learn a bit of mapping things :/.I\
      \ think i can't do this at least till August (I've to study a lot).I was thinking\
      \ about that and I'd an idea: Put a button in a sub that trigger the mover that\
      \ way the player that push the button can't reach the mover so they must cooperate\
      \ to go to the other side of the abyss :)\n\n'''Plouj:''' I added some vague\
      \ ideas. What do you think?\n\n----\n\n'''Mosquito?:'''Alpha, you still working\
      \ on this? with my new rig I've been hungering to work on a project.\n\n'''Plouj:'''\
      \ Righ now I'm not working on anything, but if anyone wants to continue AC,\
      \ go ahead, I'll be glad to see that happen. Obviously my work/ides should remain\
      \ credited as mine.\n\n'''Plouj:''' Added a link to the source [[Legacy:AlphaCoop|AlphaCoop]]\
      \ if anyone wants to continue it.\n\n'''Enos Shenk:''' If anyone takes up development\
      \ on this, i would be more then happy to map for it. If i could comprehend object-oriented\
      \ code in the slightest, i miht have a go at it.\n\n'''lincore:''' Could someone\
      \ post a link to the source? The one on [[Legacy:AlphaCoop|AlphaCoop]] is dead\
      \ and I'd like to have a look on the code."
