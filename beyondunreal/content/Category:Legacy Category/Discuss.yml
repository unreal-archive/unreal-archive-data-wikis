      <p><b>sweavo:</b> I've been re-categorising the Custom Class pages to reflect\
      \ what game they are compatible with, but I've struck on an issue. First a bit\
      \ of explanation:</p>\n<p>I've been removing Category Class (xx) from custom\
      \ classes, because Category Class (xx) is for classes that ship as part of a\
      \ game. Therefore, no class can be Category Class (xx) and Category Custom Class.\
      \ A <i>page</i> might carry both tags if it has a class reference followed by\
      \ some user-contributed extensions.</p>\n<p>From that, it follows that custom\
      \ classes no longer indicate what UT version they are compatible with. So Category\
      \ Custom Class is now becoming Category Custom Class (<i>xx</i>) where <i>xx</i>\
      \ is UT, UT2003, UT2004, UT3 (though none exist at UT3 AFAIK).</p>\n<p>The issue\
      \ I have now is whether custom classes should name the GAME they are compatible\
      \ with or the ENGINE. It's quite hard to differentiate between UT2003 custom\
      \ classes and UT2004 custom classes, and also AFAIK UT2004 is a lot more popular\
      \ than UT2003... So then I'm thinking UT2003 and UT2004 are both UT2 so why\
      \ not use that tag.</p>\n<p>A possible reason why not is that a custom class\
      \ <i>extends</i> a particular class, and that parent may or may not be shipped\
      \ as part of 2k3 or 2k4. Or are the Uscript codebases of 2k3 and 2k4 pretty\
      \ close?</p>\n<p>I guess my feeling is to treat UT2003 as the \"bastard half-brother\"\
      \ and leave it locked in the basement to rot. UT and UT2004 are clearly delineated,\
      \ and I suspect UT3 will be a whole other beast.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

    text: "{{Legacy category}}\n==Proposals==\n\n===Custom Classes===\n\n'''sweavo:'''\
      \ I've been re-categorising the Custom Class pages to reflect what game they\
      \ are compatible with, but I've struck on an issue.  First a bit of explanation:\n\
      \nI've been removing Category Class (xx) from custom classes, because Category\
      \ Class (xx) is for classes that ship as part of a game.  Therefore, no class\
      \ can be Category Class (xx) and Category Custom Class.  A ''page'' might carry\
      \ both tags if it has a class reference followed by some user-contributed extensions.\n\
      \nFrom that, it follows that custom classes no longer indicate what UT version\
      \ they are compatible with.  So Category Custom Class is now becoming Category\
      \ Custom Class (''xx'') where ''xx'' is UT, UT2003, UT2004, UT3 (though none\
      \ exist at UT3 AFAIK).\n\nThe issue I have now is whether custom classes should\
      \ name the GAME they are compatible with or the ENGINE.  It's quite hard to\
      \ differentiate between UT2003 custom classes and UT2004 custom classes, and\
      \ also AFAIK UT2004 is a lot more popular than UT2003...  So then I'm thinking\
      \ UT2003 and UT2004 are both UT2 so why not use that tag.\n\nA possible reason\
      \ why not is that a custom class ''extends'' a particular class, and that parent\
      \ may or may not be shipped as part of 2k3 or 2k4.  Or are the Uscript codebases\
      \ of 2k3 and 2k4 pretty close? \n\nI guess my feeling is to treat UT2003 as\
      \ the \"bastard half-brother\" and leave it locked in the basement to rot. \
      \ UT and UT2004 are clearly delineated, and I suspect UT3 will be a whole other\
      \ beast.\n\n===Examples===\n\nProposal for [[:Category:Legacy Example]]:\n\n\
      '''Tarquin:'''  There are a few practical examples scattered around here &ndash;\
      \ perhaps a [[:Category:Legacy Example]] would be a good idea?\n\n'''sweavo:'''\
      \ this sounds good, for code snippets that are not whole classes.  I think Category\
      \ Custom Class (''xx'') should only be used for complete classes that can be\
      \ cut n pasted.  If something is more of a 'howto' than a finished product,\
      \ it should be in Category Example.  \n\nThe difference between Category Example\
      \ and Category Tutorial ?  Not sure.  Tutorial implies a structured approach,\
      \ first do this then do this, whereas example is \"look, this works\".  But\
      \ a lot of the writing on here is so bad that pages are unable to decide whether\
      \ they are tutorial or reference material.\n\n===Basic Procedure===\n\n'''Switch`:'''\
      \ Why [[Legacy:Basic_Procedure|Basic_Procedure]] is not a member of the [[:Category:Legacy\
      \ Category]] ? \n\n===Application and Third-party Components===\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Are [[Legacy:Application|Application]] and [[Legacy:Third-Party Components|third-Party\
      \ Components]] already those categories? should the content from those be shunted\
      \ to the category page, or should we consider the exiting pages to be speudo-categories?\n\
      \n===Category Engine?===\n\nWhat to do with pages that don't apply to ''the\
      \ game'', but to their engine capabilities (like dynamic array support). Maybe\
      \ a category like [[:Category:Legacy Engine (Warfare)]] ?\n\n===Topic Pages===\n\
      \nProposal for [[:Category:Legacy Topic Page]]:\n\n'''Tarquin:''' though they're\
      \ all listed on the main page and there's only about 10 of them)\n\n===Area\
      \ Topics===\n\n'''Mosquito:''' I think we should have categories for every major\
      \ area of Unreal developement.  First of all you should have different categories\
      \ for the game specific editting such as [[:Category:Legacy UT]], or [[:Category:Legacy\
      \ UT2003]].  I also think it would be better if you had categories for every\
      \ aspect such as:\n* [[:Category:Legacy Mapping]]\n* [[:Category:Legacy Modeling]]\n\
      * [[:Category:Legacy Scripting]]\n* [[:Category:Legacy Texturing]]\n\nAnd then\
      \ maybe perhaps sub-categories like for mapping, different aspects of mapping:\n\
      * [[:Category:Legacy Mapping CSG]]\n* [[:Category:Legacy Mapping Lights]]\n\
      * [[:Category:Legacy Mapping Textures]]\n* [[:Category:Legacy Mapping Tools]]\
      \ IE, the tools at the top such as the texture browser, prefab browser, etc.\n\
      \nJust a suggestion.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' [[Wiki:PleasePleaseDontCategorizeEveryPageOnWiki]]\
      \ :o<br />Cleaning up the topic pages instead of creating category pages would\
      \ be much better. (and probably less work) How many pages are there on CSG and\
      \ would an average newcomer even know what a CSG category covers? I don't think\
      \ so.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Yup. Let's clean up the ''forward'' indexes!\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ I'm finding a need to Categorize pages that talk about Modding and Mutator\
      \ making.  There is no [[:Category:Legacy Modding]] yet and the Category Class\
      \ tag isn't helpful for these pages that talk about modding concepts and elements\
      \ without being a tutorial or a custom class.  Category Scripting may be a good\
      \ name too, but I find people come looking for \"Modding\" stuff just as much,\
      \ if not more, than they look for \"Scripting\" stuff. (Scripting can be confused\
      \ with AIScripting)  On another note, I'm voting for no sub-categories as mentioned\
      \ above.  We have Topic pages for those.\n\n===Structs===\n\n'''Pingz:''' Where\
      \ should struct documentation like [[Legacy:Quaternion|Quaternion]] and [[Legacy:Vector|Vector]]\
      \ go?  Shouldn't they too belong to a category?  Maybe just stick them in the\
      \ class category?\n\n'''Wormbo:''' We already have a [[:Category:Legacy Enum]],\
      \ so why not make a [[:Category:Legacy Struct]] for them if we really have that\
      \ many struct pages, but remember, [[Wiki:PleasePleaseDontCategorizeEveryPageOnWiki]].\n\
      \n===Community===\n\n'''Ch3z'''Seems like there are some pages here that are\
      \ more geared toward the community of Unreal Wiki frequenters and contributors\
      \ than toward the reference type of document that is being created here. Some\
      \ are Mod_Ideas, Map_Ideas, Test_Center, the whole category of personal pages...\
      \ maybe not enough for a category though. It just seems like if you were to\
      \ turn this wiki into a book those kinds of pages would be edited out, thus\
      \ they are set apart from the rest and maybe should be categorized.\n\n===Engines===\n\
      \n[[:Category:Legacy UE3]]\n\n'''Blip2:''' For solidsnake's tuts :P\n\n'''Graphik:'''\
      \ Erm, we don't have a Category UE1 or 2...\n\n===Global Restructure of Wiki\
      \ (Denied)===\n\n'''Legal:''' Isn't it about time to split the Wiki for real,\
      \ that is, www.wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/(game)/(normal subpages)? UT would\
      \ be www.wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/UT/Mover for instance. It would be easier\
      \ as pages and sub-pages wouldn't be named (DX), (UT), (UT2004) and whatever.\
      \ It's getting quite messy knowing what's UT and what's UT2k4 etc for me, and\
      \ I'm not exactly an all-green mapper. The only downside is the duplicate pages\
      \ needed for things which are the same, but that's the only thing. How about\
      \ it?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' That would be an almighty task. What would be gained\
      \ by it? You'd still have to put the game name in the links. We'd still need\
      \ to spend a lot of time cleaning up, which is all that we need at the moment.\
      \ Which pages are particularly bad? Could people mark them when they find them,\
      \ or even better, make a start on cleaning them up?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' The real\
      \ problem is manpower. Your scheme would still require people to put in some\
      \ work and help shift everything across. I don't see people helping round here\
      \ :(\n\n'''Legal:''' Yeah, guess so... but it would make things more tidied\
      \ in my opinion. Ah well, guess it's best to leave it anyway.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ no, it wouldn't... we'd announce a new organisation scheme, ask for help,\
      \ make a rough start and then.... it would lie dormant for ages, and even more\
      \ of a mess. What we need is people to make small changes here and there: it\
      \ will add up over time :) I fixed a few pages this morning....\n\n==Problems==\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Editing preview shows the #MAGIC line as a single-item numbered\
      \ list at the top of the page.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Will look into it. Just need\
      \ to bypass it in some way in the displaying."
