      \ UnFramed Productions]\n\n[[Legacy:UMS|Main UMS Page]]\n\n===Introduction===\n\
      \nThis tutorial aims to give you the understanding of how interpolation points\
      \ work, and how to set them up \n\n===How Interpolation Points work===\n\n#\
      \ Interpolation is a way of getting a smooth path (in this case for a camera)\
      \ from a series of points. It is not the same as splining, as I will explain.\
      \ \n# A spline is a smoothed line that goes through all of the points in the\
      \ path. This is commonly used for smooth paths, but not in Unreal. \n# An interpolated\
      \ curve doesn't actually touch the points at all. It is pulled towards the points,\
      \ but without actually going through them. This is the way Unreal uses Interpolation\
      \ Points.\n\n===Adding Interpolation Points to your map ===\n\n# [[Legacy:InterpolationPoint|InterpolationPoint]]s\
      \ (hereafter called IP's) can be found under '''Keypoint >> InterpolationPoint'''\
      \ in the [[Legacy:Actor Classes|Actor Classes]] Browser. The first thing to\
      \ do is to add one to your level where you want the camera to start. \n# It\
      \ will have an arrow on, and can either be rotated in the 2D views, or in the\
      \ '''InterpolationPoint Properties -> Movement -> Rotation'''. This will define\
      \ (funnily enough) the direction that the camera will be pointing. \n# In InterpolationPoint\
      \ Properties -> InterpolationPoint -> Position, you should put the number that\
      \ defines what point in the path this IP is at. This should start at 0, and\
      \ I have been informed that the upper limit is 127 (thanks to TheMapper for\
      \ that). \n# I think the best thing to do, is to first add the IP's to your\
      \ level, in aproximately the right places. Then you can get the path set up\
      \ correctly, before changing the speed. \n# Once you have got all your IP's\

      \ to have two IP's. Then, put another one in the same position as the first,\
      \ and give it the next Position after the last one. This is because IP paths\
      \ actually loop, and the only way to get the path to go through a point is to\
      \ put two IP's on top of each other. The reason the highest number IP is at\
      \ the beginning of the path is because the camera will start half way between\
      \ the first and last IP's. \n\n===Making your camera follow your Interpolation\
      \ Point path===\n\n# Once you have youe IP path in, select all the IP's (right\
      \ click on one, and select '''Select all InterpolationPoint''' actors). Change\
      \ the tag on all of them to the same thing. This could be something like '''CamPath1'''.\
      \ \n# Now, in your '''Director''', put the following two lines: '''Camera Camera1\
      \ CutTo''' and '''Camera Camera1 Interpolate CamPath1''' \n# You will need to\
      \ make sure that you have a camera called '''Camera1''' somewhere in the level.\
      \ I would recommend that it can't see anything before it goes to the IP path.\
      \ \n\n===Tweaking your Interpolation Point path===\n\n# Now, if you followed\
      \ my instructions for the '''Director''' in the first tutorial, you should have\
      \ '''ChangeHUD''' and '''SetSpeed''' at the beginning. Change the '''ScriptVals'''\
      \ on the command with '''SetSpeed''' in to '''0.2'''. This will make the whole\

      \ Points===\n\n# Once you have your path correct, you may want to play around\
      \ with the speed. You will find that it looks a lot nicer if the speed does\
      \ vary. Knowing when to vary the speed isn't something that I can teach you.\
      \ \n# To change the speed, go to '''InterpolationPoint Properties -> InterpolationPoint\

      \ That is about it for Interpolation Points. Again, if you have any questions,\
      \ do e-mail me at hugh@unframed.org. \n\n===What's next===\n\nIn the [[Legacy:UMS/EffectsTutorial|next\

      \ glass. This is the sort of thing that, if you have used UnrealEd extensively\
      \ before, you will already know about \n\n----\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Hugh, I've\
      \ taken the liberty of copying the section on IPs in general to [[Legacy:InterpolationPoint|InterpolationPoint]].\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' It's moved again to [[Legacy:Making An Interpolation Path|Making\
      \ An Interpolation Path]]. Hugh, I suggest we move anything on creating the\
      \ path to that page & point to it here."
