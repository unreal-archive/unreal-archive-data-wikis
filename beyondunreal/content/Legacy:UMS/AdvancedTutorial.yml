      \ title=\"Edit section: Adding Sound Effects and voices\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Sound effects and voices\
      \ are done in exactly the same way. If you have ever done more complex maps\
      \ in UnrealEd, you will know all about <a href=\"/Legacy:SpecialEvent\" title=\"\
      Legacy:SpecialEvent\">SpecialEvents</a> (hereafter refered to as SE's). SE's\
      \ can control a lot of things, one of which is sound.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>SE's\
      \ can be found in the <b><a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_Classes\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\
      \ Classes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Actor Classes</a> Browser</b> under <b>Triggers\
      \ &gt;&gt; Special Event</b>. Add one of these to your level, and move it to\
      \ the right place where you want the sound to come from.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n\
      <li>Now, load up the relevant .uax (Unreal Audio file). This can be done by\
      \ going to the <b>SoundFX Browser</b> and clicking <b>Load</b> at the bottom,\
      \ and selecting the file.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>If you want to import sound\
      \ files, instead of clicking <b>Load</b>, click on <b>Import</b>. Then, find\
      \ the .wav files that you want to use. (When you name the files, I would recommend\
      \ using the format <b>ssNamell</b> where <b>ss</b> is the scene number (use\
      \ 01 instead of 1), <b>ll</b> is the line number (same thing applies - 01 instead\
      \ of 1) and <b>Name</b> is the name of the character) Import the .wav files\
      \ one character at a time. So, say you have a character called <b>Suzi</b>,\
      \ you would import all of <b>Suzi's</b> lines at once. (Make sure they are all\
      \ in the same directory, and click on the first, hold down SHIFT, and click\
      \ on the last one) When you click on <b>Open</b>, you will be prompted for the\
      \ <b>Name</b>, the <b>Group</b> and the <b>Package</b>. The <b>Name</b> should\
      \ stay the same, as long as you named them all before. For the <b>Group</b>,\
      \ I would recommend using the character's name, in this case <b>Suzi</b>, and\
      \ for the <b>Package</b>, you should call it something to do with your film.\
      \ DO NOT call all your files (.uax, .utx, etc) the same thing. IE, for <b>The\
      \ Castle</b>, I called the sounds package <b>TheCastleSounds.uax</b> and <b>TheCastleTextures.utx</b>\
      \ rather than having <b>TheCastle.uax</b>, <b>TheCastle.utx</b> etc.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Once you have all your sounds imported, it is time to go to\
      \ the Special Event properties. Go to <b>SpecialEvent -&gt; Sound</b>. Next,\
      \ find the sound that you want to use in the <b>SoundFX Browser</b>. Click on\
      \ it once (double clicking will play it) and then click on <b>Use</b> in the\
      \ SE properties.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Because SE's can do so many different\
      \ things, you need to tell this one that it is meant to play a sound. This is\
      \ done from <b>Object -&gt; InitialState</b>. Change this to <b>PlaySoundEffect</b>.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Now you will need to give the SE the right tag (<b>Event -&gt;\
      \ Tag</b>). I would recommend calling this the same name as the line.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Triggering the sound effect from the director is the same as\
      \ triggering any other ready built-in effect, which is covered in the next section...</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Triggering_events\">Triggering events</span><span\

      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:UMS/AdvancedTutorial?section=4\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Triggering events\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>Triggering events using UMS is very simple. All you have to do is\
      \ put <b>Effect Whatever</b>, where <b>Whatever</b> is the tag of the event\
      \ being triggered. So, for a sound event, if the SE is called <b>03Suzi05</b>,\
      \ you would put Effect <b>03Suzi05</b> into the director.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span\

      <ol>\n<li>I have already covered this partially in the very first tutorial,\
      \ but I am going to explain it a bit better here. SetSpeed is, unfortunately,\
      \ limited by UT to between .2 and 40. This is still quite a big range. I can't\
      \ really see a time when you would want to go much over 2, but there have been\
      \ times when I have wanted to go to less than .2</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The\
      \ command for SetSpeed is just that: <b>SetSpeed</b> in the <b>Script</b>, and\
      \ the speed that you want it to go at in the <b>ScriptVals</b></li>\n</ol>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changing_the_Point_of_View_.28POV.29\"\
      >Changing the Point of View (POV)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:UMS/AdvancedTutorial?section=6\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Changing the Point of View (POV)\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>This does the same\
      \ thing as making a camera <b>CutTo</b>, but this will set the view to be from\
      \ a pawn's point of view.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The command is ver simple -\
      \ <b>POV Pawn1</b> where <b>Pawn1</b> is the pawn that you want the POV to be\
      \ from.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Playing_and_changing_music\"\
      >Playing and changing music</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:UMS/AdvancedTutorial?section=7\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Playing and changing music\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>One of the great advantages\
      \ of Unreal engine games is the format of the music. Being in XM format gives\
      \ editors much more control over what part of the music is played where. It\
      \ is very easy to have a repeating section of the music, which suddenly changes\
      \ when something important happend.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The format in the\
      \ director for the music is <b>PlaySong SongPackage.SongName</b>. The <b>SongPackage</b>\
      \ and the <b>SongName</b> are, in most cases, the same. They can be found by\
      \ going to the <b>Music Browser</b> and loading up a .umx file. The name of\
      \ that file is the <b>SongPackage</b> and the name of the song which appears\
      \ in the browser is the <b>SongName</b>. Because only one song can be held in\
      \ each package, it is very unusual for these to be different.</li>\n</ol>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>If you don't know about the format of XM or MOD music, then do skip\
      \ onto the next section of this tutorial, as this may just confuse you, but\
      \ if you do know about this sort of music, then you will know what I am talking\
      \ about.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The <b>ScriptVals</b> is the section of the\
      \ song to play from. As this command can be used for changing the section of\
      \ the song, you will need to have a look at the original song for this.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li>In one of the <b>ScriptVectors</b> slots, you should put the\
      \ number which corresponds to the transition that you want. If this is not a\
      \ whole number, of if it is 5 or more, then the song won't change. However,\
      \ here are the transitions for 0 to 4:</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n\
      <td>An instant change</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Segue (I think this\
      \ means that it waits until the end of the section before going to the one you\
      \ told it to)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>A medium fade</td>\n</tr>\n\
      <tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>A fast fade</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>A slow\
      \ fade</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changing_the_HUD\"\

      \ section: Changing the HUD\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>This was covered pretty well in the first tutorial,\
      \ but I will go over it again here. To change the HUD, the command is <b>ChangeHUD\
      \ HUDPackage.HUDName</b> where <b>HUDPackage</b> is the package that the HUD\
      \ is included in, and <b>HUDName</b> is the name of the HUD.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n\
      <li>So, for both the HUD's that were included with UMS, the <b>HUDPackage</b>\
      \ would be <b>UMS</b> and the <b>HUDName</b> would be <b>MovieHUD</b> or <b>Letterbox</b></li>\n\
      </ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Putting_Dialogue_onto_the_screen\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Putting Dialogue onto the screen\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>There aren't many uses\
      \ for this command as it stands at the moment, apart from, maybe, putting something\
      \ onto the screen to say where a scene is taking place. You can't actually control\
      \ where on the screen it is, though.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The <b>Script</b>\
      \ command for the dialogue is <b>Dialogue Message that you want to appear</b>.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li><b>ScriptVals</b> is the size of the text, ranging from 1 to\
      \ 7. If you leave it at 0, then the text will be the same size as it was the\
      \ previous time.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><b>ScriptVectors</b> contains the colour\
      \ of the text. X corresponds to red, Y to green, and Z to blue. These values\
      \ should be between 0 and 255. If you find that your text does not appear, check\
      \ that the colour is in there.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>If the text is longer\
      \ than one line, then it will carry on on the next line.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n\
      <li>The text will stay on the screen until you do a blank <b>Dialogue</b> command.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Looping_the_director\">Looping the\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>You can, if you want, get a series of commands\
      \ in the director to loop. This is done by putting <b>Loop 6</b> (or, instead\
      \ of <b>6</b>, you put the command number that you want it to go to).</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li>In <b>ScriptVals</b>, you should put the number of times that\
      \ you want it to loop back. If this is 0, then it won't actually loop back,\
      \ meaning that it will have done those commands once only.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span\

      \ Spawning objects\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>With this command, you can add new objects to the level, in the middle\
      \ of a scene. You can't, unfortunately, change the properties of the new objects,\
      \ apart from setting the <b>Tag</b>. If you want to make, say, a person suddenly\
      \ appear, then I would recommend having them elsewhere in the level, and making\
      \ them move to that point with a move time of 0.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The\
      \ command is: <b>Spawn Package.Object AnotherObject</b> where <b>Package.Object</b>\
      \ is the object that you want to appear, and <b>AnotherObject</b> is the object\
      \ that you want the spawned object to appear with.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><b>ScriptVectors</b>\
      \ has the offset from <b>AnotherObject</b> that you want the new object to appear\
      \ at.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><b>ScriptRotators</b> is the rotation of the new\
      \ object</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li><b>ScriptNames</b> is the tag that you want\

    text: "==Unreal Movie Studio Advanced Tutorial==\n\nby Hugh Macdonald\n\n[http://unframed.brokenpipefilms.com\
      \ UnFramed Productions]\n\n[[Legacy:UMS|Main UMS Page]]\n\n===Introduction===\n\
      \nThis tutorial aims to give the UMS user information about the extra director\
      \ functions, including changing level, sound effects, and triggering other effects.\
      \ \n\n===Adding Sound Effects and voices===\n\n# Sound effects and voices are\
      \ done in exactly the same way. If you have ever done more complex maps in UnrealEd,\
      \ you will know all about [[Legacy:SpecialEvent|SpecialEvent]]s (hereafter refered\
      \ to as SE's). SE's can control a lot of things, one of which is sound. \n\n\
      # SE's can be found in the '''[[Legacy:Actor Classes|Actor Classes]] Browser'''\
      \ under '''Triggers >> Special Event'''. Add one of these to your level, and\
      \ move it to the right place where you want the sound to come from. \n\n# Now,\
      \ load up the relevant .uax (Unreal Audio file). This can be done by going to\
      \ the '''SoundFX Browser''' and clicking '''Load''' at the bottom, and selecting\
      \ the file. \n\n# If you want to import sound files, instead of clicking '''Load''',\
      \ click on '''Import'''. Then, find the .wav files that you want to use. (When\
      \ you name the files, I would recommend using the format '''ssNamell''' where\
      \ '''ss''' is the scene number (use 01 instead of 1), '''ll''' is the line number\
      \ (same thing applies - 01 instead of 1) and '''Name''' is the name of the character)\
      \ Import the .wav files one character at a time. So, say you have a character\
      \ called '''Suzi''', you would import all of '''Suzi's''' lines at once. (Make\
      \ sure they are all in the same directory, and click on the first, hold down\
      \ SHIFT, and click on the last one) When you click on '''Open''', you will be\
      \ prompted for the '''Name''', the '''Group''' and the '''Package'''. The '''Name'''\
      \ should stay the same, as long as you named them all before. For the '''Group''',\
      \ I would recommend using the character's name, in this case '''Suzi''', and\
      \ for the '''Package''', you should call it something to do with your film.\
      \ DO NOT call all your files (.uax, .utx, etc) the same thing. IE, for '''The\
      \ Castle''', I called the sounds package '''TheCastleSounds.uax''' and '''TheCastleTextures.utx'''\
      \ rather than having '''TheCastle.uax''', '''TheCastle.utx''' etc. \n\n# Once\
      \ you have all your sounds imported, it is time to go to the Special Event properties.\
      \ Go to '''SpecialEvent -> Sound'''. Next, find the sound that you want to use\
      \ in the '''SoundFX Browser'''. Click on it once (double clicking will play\
      \ it) and then click on '''Use''' in the SE properties. \n\n# Because SE's can\
      \ do so many different things, you need to tell this one that it is meant to\
      \ play a sound. This is done from '''Object -> InitialState'''. Change this\
      \ to '''PlaySoundEffect'''. \n\n# Now you will need to give the SE the right\
      \ tag ('''Event -> Tag'''). I would recommend calling this the same name as\
      \ the line. \n\n# Triggering the sound effect from the director is the same\
      \ as triggering any other ready built-in effect, which is covered in the next\
      \ section... \n\n===Triggering events===\n\n# Triggering events using UMS is\
      \ very simple. All you have to do is put '''Effect Whatever''', where '''Whatever'''\
      \ is the tag of the event being triggered. So, for a sound event, if the SE\
      \ is called '''03Suzi05''', you would put Effect '''03Suzi05''' into the director.\
      \ \n\n===Setting the speed===\n\n# I have already covered this partially in\
      \ the very first tutorial, but I am going to explain it a bit better here. SetSpeed\
      \ is, unfortunately, limited by UT to between .2 and 40. This is still quite\
      \ a big range. I can't really see a time when you would want to go much over\
      \ 2, but there have been times when I have wanted to go to less than .2 \n\n\
      # The command for SetSpeed is just that: '''SetSpeed''' in the '''Script''',\
      \ and the speed that you want it to go at in the '''ScriptVals''' \n\n===Changing\
      \ the Point of View (POV)===\n\n# This does the same thing as making a camera\
      \ '''CutTo''', but this will set the view to be from a pawn's point of view.\
      \ \n\n# The command is ver simple - '''POV Pawn1''' where '''Pawn1''' is the\
      \ pawn that you want the POV to be from. \n\n===Playing and changing music===\n\
      \n# One of the great advantages of Unreal engine games is the format of the\
      \ music. Being in XM format gives editors much more control over what part of\
      \ the music is played where. It is very easy to have a repeating section of\
      \ the music, which suddenly changes when something important happend. \n\n#\
      \ The format in the director for the music is '''PlaySong SongPackage.SongName'''.\
      \ The '''SongPackage''' and the '''SongName''' are, in most cases, the same.\
      \ They can be found by going to the '''Music Browser''' and loading up a .umx\
      \ file. The name of that file is the '''SongPackage''' and the name of the song\
      \ which appears in the browser is the '''SongName'''. Because only one song\
      \ can be held in each package, it is very unusual for these to be different.\
      \ \n\n# If you don't know about the format of XM or MOD music, then do skip\
      \ onto the next section of this tutorial, as this may just confuse you, but\
      \ if you do know about this sort of music, then you will know what I am talking\
      \ about. \n\n# The '''ScriptVals''' is the section of the song to play from.\
      \ As this command can be used for changing the section of the song, you will\
      \ need to have a look at the original song for this. \n\n# In one of the '''ScriptVectors'''\
      \ slots, you should put the number which corresponds to the transition that\
      \ you want. If this is not a whole number, of if it is 5 or more, then the song\
      \ won't change. However, here are the transitions for 0 to 4: \n\n{|\n\n|-\n\
      |0\n|An instant change \n|-\n|1\n|Segue (I think this means that it waits until\
      \ the end of the section before going to the one you told it to) \n|-\n|2\n\
      |A medium fade \n|-\n|3\n|A fast fade \n|-\n|4\n|A slow fade \n|}\n\n===Changing\
      \ the HUD===\n\n# This was covered pretty well in the first tutorial, but I\
      \ will go over it again here. To change the HUD, the command is '''ChangeHUD\
      \ HUDPackage.HUDName''' where '''HUDPackage''' is the package that the HUD is\
      \ included in, and '''HUDName''' is the name of the HUD. \n\n# So, for both\
      \ the HUD's that were included with UMS, the '''HUDPackage''' would be '''UMS'''\
      \ and the '''HUDName''' would be '''MovieHUD''' or '''Letterbox''' \n\n===Putting\
      \ Dialogue onto the screen===\n\n# There aren't many uses for this command as\
      \ it stands at the moment, apart from, maybe, putting something onto the screen\
      \ to say where a scene is taking place. You can't actually control where on\
      \ the screen it is, though. \n\n# The '''Script''' command for the dialogue\
      \ is '''Dialogue Message that you want to appear'''. \n\n# '''ScriptVals'''\
      \ is the size of the text, ranging from 1 to 7. If you leave it at 0, then the\
      \ text will be the same size as it was the previous time. \n\n# '''ScriptVectors'''\
      \ contains the colour of the text. X corresponds to red, Y to green, and Z to\
      \ blue. These values should be between 0 and 255. If you find that your text\
      \ does not appear, check that the colour is in there. \n\n# If the text is longer\
      \ than one line, then it will carry on on the next line. \n\n# The text will\
      \ stay on the screen until you do a blank '''Dialogue''' command. \n\n===Looping\
      \ the director===\n\n# You can, if you want, get a series of commands in the\
      \ director to loop. This is done by putting '''Loop 6''' (or, instead of '''6''',\
      \ you put the command number that you want it to go to). \n\n# In '''ScriptVals''',\
      \ you should put the number of times that you want it to loop back. If this\
      \ is 0, then it won't actually loop back, meaning that it will have done those\
      \ commands once only. \n\n===Spawning objects===\n\n# With this command, you\
      \ can add new objects to the level, in the middle of a scene. You can't, unfortunately,\
      \ change the properties of the new objects, apart from setting the '''Tag'''.\
      \ If you want to make, say, a person suddenly appear, then I would recommend\
      \ having them elsewhere in the level, and making them move to that point with\
      \ a move time of 0. \n\n# The command is: '''Spawn Package.Object AnotherObject'''\
      \ where '''Package.Object''' is the object that you want to appear, and '''AnotherObject'''\
      \ is the object that you want the spawned object to appear with. \n\n# '''ScriptVectors'''\
      \ has the offset from '''AnotherObject''' that you want the new object to appear\
      \ at. \n\n# '''ScriptRotators''' is the rotation of the new object \n\n# '''ScriptNames'''\
      \ is the tag that you want the new object to have. This is useful if you want,\
      \ say, a camera to track the new object. \n\n===Changing levels===\n\n# This\
      \ is very simple. All you have to know is the name of the level that you want\
      \ to load up. It shuld either be in UnrealTournament\\Maps, or a subdirectory\
      \ of UnrealTournament\\Maps. \n\n# The command is: '''ChangeLevel SomeLevel.unr'''\
      \ or '''ChangeLevel Somedirectory\\SomeLevel.unr''' \n\n===What's next===\n\n\
      In the [[Legacy:UMS/InterpolationTutorial|next tutorial]], I will cover setting\
      \ up Interpolation Points."
