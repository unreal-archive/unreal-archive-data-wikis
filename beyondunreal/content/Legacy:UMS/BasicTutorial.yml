      <p>This tutorial aims to give the UMS user a basic understanding of how the\
      \ director (that is, the object that controls what happens in a UMS movie) works.</p>\n\
      <p>I have assumed that anyone reading this has a basic knowledge of UnrealEd.\
      \ If you haven't used UnrealEd before, then there are some excellent tutorials\
      \ on Wolf's Unreal Editing site. More advanced users of UnrealEd may find that\
      \ I am a bit simplistic with some things - please do bear with me. I am trying\
      \ to aim these tutorials at everyone.</p>\n<p>Before you start these tutorials,\
      \ please make sure you have a map built. Even if it is just a very simple room,\
      \ just have something to put stuff into.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The first thing to do is to load up UnrealEd.\
      \ Once you have done this, you need to load UMS.u into UnrealEd. If you don't\
      \ know how to do this, you have to change the browser to 'Classes' (top right\
      \ corner of the screen - by default when you load up UnrealEd, it is set on\
      \ 'Textures'.</li>\n<li>Once you have done that, click on Load at the bottom\
      \ of the screen and select 'UMS.u'</li>\n<li>Once you have got UMS.u loaded,\
      \ you need to set up the gametype. If you have previously been making other\
      \ UT levels, then you will know all about game types. If not, I will explain\
      \ how to do this.</li>\n<li>In the classes browser click on the '-' by Info,\
      \ and then one the one by 'GameInfo'. If you have loaded UMS.u properly, you\
      \ should see 'MovieInfo' in there. Click on this.</li>\n<li>Next, press F6 to\
      \ bring up the Level Properties. Click on the '+' by <a href=\"/Legacy:LevelInfo\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:LevelInfo\">LevelInfo</a> and click on <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:DefaultGameType?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:DefaultGameType (page does not exist)\">DefaultGameType</a>.\
      \ If you then click on 'Use', <b>UMS.MovieInfo</b> should appear in the box.\
      \ (If it doesn't, you've got problems - try clicking on 'MovieInfo' again in\
      \ the browser - it should say <b>UMS.MovieInfo</b> just below the classes browser.\
      \ If this doesn't work, mail me at hugh@unframed.org)</li>\n<li>We now have\
      \ the level set up to be a movie level. The next thing to do is add the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:PlayerStart\" title=\"Legacy:PlayerStart\">PlayerStart</a>. But, you\
      \ may say, my level already has a PlayerStart. I know - UT takes a fraction\
      \ of a second between loading the level and starting UMS, so you need to place\
      \ the playerstart somewhere where all you can see is black.</li>\n<li>First,\
      \ remove all PlayerStarts from your level. If you have decided to use a level\
      \ that has previously been used for Deathmatch, or another playable game, then\
      \ you will find that there are quite a few PlayerStarts already in there. I\
      \ find the best way to remove multiple PlayerStarts, or if you can't find the\
      \ one that is in there, is to add another one, right click on it, and select\
      \ <b>Select all PlayerStart actors</b> Then press delete, and there you go -\
      \ all PlayerStarts have gone.</li>\n<li>Now, to add yours. I like to just create\
      \ a small room (default cube size) just outside the level, don't add any lights,\
      \ and just place the PlayerStart on the floor in there.</li>\n<li>Now that we\
      \ have our level set up, it is time to start puttin movie-specific stuff in\
      \ there. First on the list is the Director (no, this isn't you, this is the\
      \ UMS actor which runs the show). You can have as many directors in the level,\
      \ but, although it is possible, I would not recommend having more than one running\
      \ at the same time.</li>\n<li>The director is at the root level of the classes\
      \ browser, ie, it should be visible in the classes browser straight away. If\
      \ you have saved what you did in previous sections, and quit UnrealEd, then\
      \ loaded the level back up in UnrealEd, you'll have to load UMS.u again. When\
      \ you load up a level, it only loads the objects that are actually in the level.\
      \ So, the MovieInfo will have been loaded up, but nothing else.</li>\n<li>So,\
      \ add a Director into your level by clicking on the Director in the classes\
      \ browser, and then right clicking somewhere in the map, and selecting <b>Add\
      \ Director Here</b></li>\n<li>We've got our director in the level now, so we\
      \ need to go to the properties (double click, or right click and go to 'Director\
      \ Properties' (If it says 'Director Properties (2 selected)' (or any more than\
      \ 2) then click on the single director to only select it).</li>\n<li>In the\
      \ director properties, expand 'Director' to get what is in the picture on the\
      \ right. I'll explain what each thing does, and then explain how to use them.</li>\n\
      <li>bRolling can either be <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>. By default, it is <b>False</b>.\
      \ This tells UMS whether this director is running at the beginning of the film.\
      \ Because each director only has a limited number of slots (50), you will definately\
      \ find that you have to daisy-chain directors together. This is done by setting\
      \ the first one to have bRolling as <b>True</b>, and the others as <b>False</b>.\
      \ You can then trigger the next director from the one before.</li>\n<li>Script\
      \ is the heart of the director. This is where the commands themselves go. If\
      \ you expand Script, you will see that each command has a number by it, from\
      \ 0 to 49. These numbers correspond to the other sections - ScriptNames, ScriptRotators,\
      \ ScriptVals, ScriptVectors, and WaitTimes.</li>\n<li>ScriptNames is only used\
      \ for animations, which will be covered in the third tutorial, on actors.</li>\n\
      <li>ScriptRotators is rarely used. It is optional for cameras and actors, but\
      \ not essential.</li>\n<li>ScriptVals is very important. This is used for things\
      \ like how long a camera will take to move, and most other times when a number\
      \ has to be used.</li>\n<li>ScriptVectors is used slightly more than ScriptRotators,\
      \ more about that in the actors tutorial.</li>\n<li>WaitTimes is a very important\
      \ section. The value that goes in the WaitTime for a specific command is the\
      \ time (in seconds) that UMS will wait before going onto the next command. (When\
      \ I say command, I mean all the slots, in Script, ScriptVals, etc. If I say\
      \ Slot, I generally mean just one of them (just Script, or just ScriptVals))</li>\n\
      <li>There are two things that I always put at the beginning of the script, even\
      \ if they are the defaults. That way, if I do decide to change them later, I\
      \ can very easily. These are setting the HUD, and the speed.</li>\n<li>To set\
      \ the HUD, all you have to type into the Script is <b>ChangeHUD UMS.MovieHUD</b>.\
      \ This is the default. There is one other HUD included with UMS, and that is\
      \ the Letterbox one (used for widescreen). This would be set with <b>ChangeHUD\
      \ UMS.Letterbox</b>.</li>\n<li>The other thing that I always put in before anything\
      \ else is the speed. This is done by putting <b>SetSpeed</b> in the Script,\
      \ and the value for the speed in ScriptVals. I will invariably put <b>SetSpeed</b>\
      \ in the script and <b>1</b> in the corresponding slot in ScriptVals.</li>\n\

      <li>SimplePoints are very important in UMS. They are the objects used by cameras,\
      \ and pawn. All they do is define a point on the map. They can be used to move\
      \ to, or for something to turn to face them. To add them, all you have to do\
      \ is find them in the classes browser (Keypoint -&gt; SimplePoint) and right\
      \ click in the map and select <b>Add SimplePoint here</b>.</li>\n<li>That is\
      \ about it for now. If you have been doing this as you read, you should now\
      \ have a director with <b>ChangeHUD UMS.MovieHUD</b> in Script slot 0, and <b>SetSpeed</b>\
