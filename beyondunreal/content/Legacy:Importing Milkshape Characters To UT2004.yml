      \ class=\"mw-redirect\">UT2004</a>.</p>\n<p>It is presumed that you have a character\
      \ mesh in Milkshape at this point and you only need to know how to import it\
      \ into UT2004.</p>\n<p>Go to UnrealEd. Using the textures window, you should\
      \ import your model textures. Unlike UT(99), you can have more than 4 textures\
      \ assigned to each model. They do not need to be named using the same method\
      \ as UT(99). Name them whatever you like, but be sure that each texture has\
      \ a unique name.</p>\n<p>In Milkshape, make sure the textures on the Materials\

      \ this now, it will automatically apply the named textures to the model upon\
      \ import.</p>\n<p>All vertices must be assigned to bones on a skeleton before\

      \ to utilize a currently existing UT2003/2004 Skeleton, you can find the .PSK\
      \ files necessary on one of the CDs the game came on. The benefits to this are\
      \ that you will not need to create new animations for the character.</p>\n<p>If\
      \ you wish to use a custom made skeleton, you must create all of the animations\
      \ yourself and import each animation separately. This will be covered more in\
      \ depth later.</p>\n<p>Assuming you intend to use a currently existing skeleton,\
      \ exporting is a simple affair. Go to FileExportUnreal/UT PSK/PSA. Export\
      \ your model as &lt;ModelName&gt;.psk. The PSK model format controls the relationship\
      \ between vertices and bones, as well as data pertaining to the shape of the\
      \ model, and texture placement. In layman’s terms, what the model looks like.</p>\n\
      <p>On the other hand, if you intend to use a custom made skeleton, you would\
      \ also need to export .psa versions of the model as well. The .psa format controls\
      \ animations for the model’s .psk file. Seeing as we are working with Milkshape,\
      \ the best way to handle this would be to rotate the model 90° to the left.\
      \ The reason for this is as follows: In Milkshape, the front of the model is\
      \ on the +Z Axis, while in UnrealEd, the front is +X. By rotating it in Milkshape,\
      \ it takes away one potential spot for errors to occur. You can rotate your\
      \ model in UnrealEd, however there have been times where animations will not\
      \ play correctly when translating from one program to the other. This shouldn’\
      t be an issue when using an existing skeleton.</p>\n<p>You will need to create\
      \ animations for every action. Each .psa file should contain one animation,\
      \ so it makes sense to name your .psa files in reference to what animations\
      \ are contained.</p>\n<p>In UnrealEd, you will select the Animations window\
      \ to import characters and their animations. If you are using an existing skeleton,\
      \ you will only need to import the .psk file, and reference which animation\
      \ set will be used. Be sure to match the correct animation set to your skeleton.</p>\n\
      <p>If you are using a custom skeleton, you will need to create a new skeletal\
      \ subsystem upon import (you will be prompted to do so, name it something unique\
      \ and make it in its own file). You will import each animation and append each\
      \ new one to the existing animations, not overwrite existing ones. You can name\
      \ every animation through the menu on the right side of the window. Once it\
      \ is all in place, save your information in UnrealEd.</p>\n<p>From this point\
      \ on, it is now up to setting the model up as a character, which is explained\
      \ elsewhere in the wiki.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How.3F.21\"\
