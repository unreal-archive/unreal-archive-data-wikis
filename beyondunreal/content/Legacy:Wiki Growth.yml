      <dl>\n<dd>Wow, that's pretty interesting reading. Personally I'd say we were\
      \ between stages 5 and 9. I read some research a while ago that my dad gave\
      \ me. It was a study comissioned by a group of churches in America. The conclusion\
      \ was that once a \"community\" gets over 50 people start losing the feel of\
      \ the community, and become \"transient visitors\", or merely \"attendees\"\
      \ that have no link to anyone in the community - simply because forming those\
      \ links is a daunting task because of the size of the community that exists\
      \ already.</dd>\n<dd>There were two things that attracted me to the Wiki. The\
      \ first was that way in which contribution is made - and that anyone can simply\
      \ change a page - the concept is interesting. The second was that the spare\
      \ time I have available to do this sort of stuff is intermittent - mainly because\
      \ of work and family life. The Wiki approach is completely non-pressured - so\
      \ I feel able to sustain occasional contributions because that is part of the\
      \ \"Wiki way\".</dd>\n<dd>Probably the thing that irritates me the most about\
      \ my contributions to the Wiki is that I don't exercise as much <i>rigor</i>\
      \ in the contributions as I know I would normally put in on any project I get\
      \ involved with. Still, that's a personal issue I have with myself. Might be\
      \ a time thing, might just be that I'm not at work so it matters less. Still\
      \ annoying though.</dd>\n<dd>I think Tarquin's point about the UT Scripting/Editing\
      \ community being in a state similar to hibernation is a good one. Sometimes\
      \ I feel that the current Wiki is a case of documentation for documentations\
      \ sake; UT is almost obsolete, and will be once UT2003 is released.</dd>\n<dd>Something\
      \ else that's occured to me. This is primarily a \"how to\" and documentation\
      \ wiki. It's very likely that the development of this wiki will be divergent\
      \ from a more conversational, debate orientated wiki. Oh well, that's my deep\
      \ thoughts on the matter – <i>EntropicLqd</i>.</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dd>We've made inroads into debate with things like your EntropicMods page –\
      \ that page certainly showed me that this site can outgrow my initial ideas\
      \ for it, which was very pleasing. I'm (secretly) hoping that will draw in more\
      \ of the same. Wiki is a little harder to use as a debating platform that a\
      \ forum, but it has the huge avantage that a long and winding discussion can\
      \ be refactored into major points – which can lead to further debate.</dd>\n\
      <dd>I think a healthy lack of rigor is to be positively encouraged: on Wikipedia\
      \ they say \"always leave a page unfinished\", so other people are incited to\
      \ edit the page and combine their thoughts on the topic.</dd>\n<dd>This project\
      \ has started very late in the day for UT. Wiki has been around longer than\
      \ Unreal (1995), it's a pity no-one thought to start this before. In many ways,\
      \ yes this is a sort of practice run for UT2003: getting to grips with the system,\
      \ adding things we need, and most important of all getting people involved.\
      \ Don't forget though that there are still plenty of n00bs out there on the\
      \ forums fighting the <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Goblin\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Goblin\">UnrealEd Goblin</a> for the first time. I think the large majority\
      \ of what we've written will apply to UT2; it'll largely be new aspects of the\
      \ engine we'll have to cover. When it's released I expect many people will start\
      \ writing up what they discover as they play with the new toys. I hope that\
      \ by then this site will have made enough noise &amp; attracted enough attention\
      \ for people to post here so it can all accumulate together, instead of pockets\
