      \ the content width, instead of having huge blank spaces on either side of a\
      \ \"cash register receipt width\" box of text. Various other elements have had\
      \ margins or other whitespace reduced to make more effective use of the screen\
      \ real estate.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Made some elements (table borders, colored\
      \ text) a bit more visible on some LCD screens.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>More\
      \ consistent theme. Some of the elements of the \"Chilled Blue\" style seemed\

      \ Wiki interface. The footer, diff displays, etc are now clearly distinct from\
      \ the content of the page. (not really critical, but I think it makes it look\
      \ better and is a bit easier to find what you're looking for at a glance)</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<p>Other things done along the way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Color changes to make\

      <ul>\n<li>Cleaned up the stylesheet to use more relative font sizing and element\
