      \ has had its share of success in the UT community. It did place in a few spots\
      \ in the Make Something Unreal contest as well as being including on the GOYTE\
      \ Unreal Tournament CD. But we also have had our share of problems as it was\
      \ not such a smooth ride. Most of these comments comes from my experience being\
      \ the team leader as well as a coder and mapper for the Chaotic Dreams team\
      \ over the past 18 months. I just wanted to touch on some things that we could\
      \ have done better and hope that other teams can learn and find ways to avoid\
      \ some of issues that we suffered:</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\
      Key_Talent_Leaving\">Key Talent Leaving</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\
      ><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Jb?section=4\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Key Talent Leaving\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>I am sure most teams that have been around for any\
      \ amount of time will have to deal with this. With us it was a sever blow. Chaotic\
      \ Dreams was a decent sized mod team coming off the Q2 versions (which was included\
      \ on ID's Extremities CD). However the group wanted to work on both a UT version\
      \ as well as a Q3 version. So the team sort of split into to areas with each\
      \ \"team\" working on a Chaos version for that game. The UT version had a bit\
      \ more support and we were able to get up to a GOTYE. However after that point\
      \ some of the team decided that they needed a break. Our lead mapper just had\
      \ a new addition to his family and wanted some much deserved R&amp;R. Our only\
      \ texture artist also was pursuing other interest in her Real Life and no longer\
      \ could help out. Our founder/modeler/skinner just graduated collage and took\
      \ a job working on the Y-project so he had almost no time to help. And finally\
      \ the only coder also needed time off as he wanted to get his MS degree. So\
      \ that left the once popular mod literally dead in the water. They all did not\
      \ leave at once which was a good thing. In fact I was brought in to replace\
      \ the mapper as I had been a beta tester for them. Like wise we were able to\
      \ find a few more people to help all taken from our beta test group. As you\
      \ can imagine we were still learning how to make a mod as well as our skills\
      \ had not developed to a level that was close to the original team. This meant\
      \ a lot of work for us new guys. I know that this is a pipe dream but having\
      \ extra people or people that can overlap and do more than one thing is a god\
      \ send. I was able to learn how to map and code. We also had another team member\
      \ that could map as well as model. So we could get by with out a dedicated mapper.\
      \ Not every team can afford to have people get experience in other areas but\
      \ it not only makes the team stronger but it give that person a chance to work\
      \ in another area which for some is a nice change of pace. Also networking can\
      \ help to replace talent. Getting your name/mod known can help produce leads\
      \ and draw talent in. You never know when you may need more help.</p>\n<p>It\
      \ also would have been a lot easier had these key users documented a bit more\
      \ of what they did. Us new guys were not given any guidance or direction. The\
      \ original coder did have a chance to give me all of the code files so we could\
      \ continue with the code but a lot of content had to be recreated from scratch.\
      \ While that's not the worse case it only managed use to take more time to get\
      \ to a point were we could move the mod forward.</p>\n<p>I know that things\
      \ change and it will be hard for a team to stay together. But make sure you\
      \ have a back up plan in case any key member needs to stop working due to what\
      \ ever reasons. And if that person has to leave try to get them to document\
      \ as much as they can as it will save a lot of time and energy. Also try to\
      \ keep your core info some place where others can access it. You don't want\
      \ one person to have all of the core data and if that person looses the data\
      \ then the whole team may be in trouble.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Beta Testing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>I like what Mychaeel said about beta testing and how\
      \ that's a key component. At first we did not have a system to test our mod.\
      \ So our beta testing consisted of a few of us playing the mod looking for any\
      \ errors. While that's fine and dandy for some part it was not enough. It was\
      \ my fault that we did not concentrate on it more. There were some bugs that\
      \ should have been caught but were not. Also that method is not very efficient.\
      \ We have since refined our method to test for certain areas and have broken\
      \ up the work to each beta tester. This allows us to not only cover more areas\
      \ but also spend less time doing so. It also helps to have good testers. A few\
      \ we had in the past did not document very well the \"when and where\" when\
      \ a bug was found. So it was hard to reproduce and fix (I was probably the worst\
      \ beta tester we had). The current group of guys has really done a good job\
      \ of providing all of the details on how to create the bug so I can attempt\
      \ to fix it vrs spending hours to reproduce it. I would like to see our beta\
      \ testers grow a bit more so we can continue to refine our methods. Beta testing\
      \ is one of the most important parts of the mod making process; don't over look\
      \ it!</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coding\">Coding</span><span\

      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Jb?section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Coding\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Here is another\
      \ thing that I should have know better. I thought some classes in assembly coding\
      \ while I was in my graduate studies at school. I stressed to my students that's\
      \ comments were essential. Yet I look back at the code I wrote and I hardly\
      \ have any. What a hypocrite I am&#160;:( The original coder did not have time\
      \ to comment his code and I was always working on it in a \"fire fight mode\"\
      \ meaning I need to get the code working now. So I did not spend time looking\
      \ over each and every line of his code. And with out comments I was lost in\
      \ parts. I made assumptions and most of the time those were wrong. With the\
      \ new code I did write I did comment it better. And no I don't mean every line\
      \ needs to have comments. But looking at code with nothing commented is hard\
      \ to do. It would have saved me a lot of time had we had some comments in our\
      \ code. The new code we have written for the next version of Chaos is well committed\
      \ and we will keep it that way.</p>\n<p>Also at one brief time there was two\
      \ of us working on code. There was one case we both worked ended up working\
      \ on the same thing and had over lapping code. The problem is we lost some of\
      \ my work when he did the code and vise versa. If your sharing code you need\
      \ to have good communication. I would prefer to have one person keep control\
      \ of one part of the code that they are responsible and the other keeps track\
      \ of a different set of code that is their responsibility. Other wise sharing\
      \ code is a nightmare...</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Team_Size\"\

      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Chaos\
      \ never really had a dedicated leader or any set positions. For the most part\
      \ we were just a bunch of people hanging out having fun. However as the team\
      \ has grown a bit it gets a lot hard to keep things moving. You have a difference\
      \ of opinion on all sorts of things as well as some confusion. We have since\
      \ tried to make some general listings so we can delegate the work to the right\
      \ group. I agree this sounds like common sense but that's something we did not\
      \ do at first.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Public_news\">Public\

      \ news\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>During the time we had transition from the \"old\" to the \"new\" team we\
      \ had almost no news or other public showing. I think that really hurt us. I\
      \ have seen some mods draw in a huge following with out releasing anything.\
      \ They do this by many different means. Now while I don't want to change ChaosUT\
      \ to mod that wants to be popular, I do want to keep the fans more in tune to\
      \ what's going one. Once every 7 weeks, updates to the sites will not get that\
      \ goal done. We have since re-did the interface to submit news to make it a\
      \ bit easier for us to keep the public up to date. We also want to start posting\
      \ more concept art and development work. We have seen a lot of other mod teams\
      \ post renders of their ideas in various stated of development. We are not making\
      \ Chaos for us, we are making it for you and we need to work on that last part\
      \ better.</p>\n<p>I am sure some of the other teams out there have done all\
      \ of these a lot better than what we did. And most of these are common sense.\
      \ However I am sure we are not the only mod to suffer some of these setbacks\
      \ and other issues. So I hope that we all can learn from our mistakes and make\
      \ sure that we do not make the same mistakes next time. Thanks for your time,\

      \  Also try to keep your core info some place where others can access it. You\
      \ don't want one person to have all of the core data and if that person looses\
      \ the data then the whole team may be in trouble.\n\n===Beta Testing===\n\n\
      I like what Mychaeel said about beta testing and how that's a key component.\
      \ At first we did not have a system to test our mod. So our beta testing consisted\
      \ of a few of us playing the mod looking for any errors. While that's fine and\
      \ dandy for some part it was not enough. It was my fault that we did not concentrate\
      \ on it more.  There were some bugs that should have been caught but were not.\
      \ Also that method is not very efficient. We have since refined our method to\
      \ test for certain areas and have broken up the work to each beta tester. This\
      \ allows us to not only cover more areas but also spend less time doing so.\
      \ It also helps to have good testers. A few we had in the past did not document\
      \ very well the \"when and where\" when a bug was found. So it was hard to reproduce\
      \ and fix (I was probably the worst beta tester we had). The current group of\
      \ guys has really done a good job of providing all of the details on how to\
      \ create the bug so I can attempt to fix it vrs spending hours to reproduce\
      \ it. I would like to see our beta testers grow a bit more so we can continue\
      \ to refine our methods. Beta testing is one of the most important parts of\
      \ the mod making process; don't over look it! \n\n===Coding===\n\nHere is another\
      \ thing that I should have know better. I thought some classes in assembly coding\
      \ while I was in my graduate studies at school. I stressed to my students that's\
      \ comments were essential. Yet I look back at the code I wrote and I hardly\
      \ have any. What a hypocrite I am :( The original coder did not have time to\
      \ comment his code and I was always working on it in a \"fire fight mode\" meaning\
      \ I need to get the code working now. So I did not spend time looking over each\
      \ and every line of his code. And with out comments I was lost in parts. I made\
      \ assumptions and most of the time those were wrong. With the new code I did\
      \ write I did comment it better. And no I don't mean every line needs to have\
      \ comments. But looking at code with nothing commented is hard to do. It would\
      \ have saved me a lot of time had we had some comments in our code. The new\
      \ code we have written for the next version of Chaos is well committed and we\
      \ will keep it that way. \n\nAlso at one brief time there was two of us working\
      \ on code. There was one case we both worked ended up working on the same thing\
      \ and had over lapping code. The problem is we lost some of my work when he\
      \ did the code and vise versa. If your sharing code you need to have good communication.\
      \ I would prefer to have one person keep control of one part of the code that\
      \ they are responsible and the other keeps track of a different set of code\
      \ that is their responsibility. Other wise sharing code is a nightmare...\n\n\
      ===Team Size===\n\nChaos never really had a dedicated leader or any set positions.\
      \ For the most part we were just a bunch of people hanging out having fun. However\
      \ as the team has grown a bit it gets a lot hard to keep things moving. You\
      \ have a difference of opinion on all sorts of things as well as some confusion.\
      \ We have since tried to make some general listings so we can delegate the work\
      \ to the right group. I agree this sounds like common sense but that's something\
      \ we did not do at first.\n\n===Public news===\n\nDuring the time we had transition\
      \ from the \"old\" to the \"new\" team we had almost no news or other public\
      \ showing. I think that really hurt us. I have seen some mods draw in a huge\
      \ following with out releasing anything. They do this by many different means.\
      \ Now while I don't want to change ChaosUT to mod that wants to be popular,\
      \ I do want to keep the fans more in tune to what's going one. Once every 7\
      \ weeks, updates to the sites will not get that goal done. We have since re-did\
      \ the interface to submit news to make it a bit easier for us to keep the public\
      \ up to date. We also want to start posting more concept art and development\
      \ work. We have seen a lot of other mod teams post renders of their ideas in\
      \ various stated of development. We are not making Chaos for us, we are making\
      \ it for you and we need to work on that last part better. \n\nI am sure some\
      \ of the other teams out there have done all of these a lot better than what\
      \ we did. And most of these are common sense. However I am sure we are not the\
      \ only mod to suffer some of these setbacks and other issues. So I hope that\
      \ we all can learn from our mistakes and make sure that we do not make the same\
      \ mistakes next time. Thanks for your time, Jb\n\n----\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Welcome\

      \ That's some great advice in your history of ChaosUT, Jb. I'm starting to wonder\
      \ if your ideas from this page and [[Legacy:Mychaeel|Mychaeel]]'s could be made\
      \ into a general page on [[Legacy:Mod Creation|Mod Creation]]. \n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ All good stuff there JB.  For all that it might have been painful, you chaps\
      \ succeeded where a lot of teams would have simply folded up.  And ''Real Life''\
      \ is a right bugger as when the cards are called the \"game\" always loses.\
      \  I'd be interested in some more detail on your testing strategies .. good\
      \ testers are damn hard to find.\n\n'''Jb:''' I'd be happy to help in any way\
      \ if you think a page like that is a good idea Tarquin, Just let me know what\
      \ I can do to help.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Have a read of [[Legacy:Making Mods/Effective\
      \ Testing|Making Mods/Effective Testing]] and change, comment, refactor at will.\
      \  It looks like [[Legacy:Making Mods|Making Mods]] might become a reality.\
      \  We shall see. \n\n'''Vajuras:''' This was a very entertaining read. Choas\
      \ UT has definetly accomplished a lot of great feats. Good to see things are\
      \ back on track!\n\n'''LoQtUS:''' That sounds like an acurate account to me\
      \ ;) Allthough i really dont think i was a god send. heh\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
