      <p>Unreal Units, or UU. Often simply called \"units\", or even not given a name\
      \ at all (\"build a 256x256x64 box\"). The UnrealEd <a href=\"/Legacy:Grid\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Grid\">grid</a>, dimensions of <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Brush\">brushes</a>, positions of <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Actor\">actors</a> and sizes of <a href=\"/Legacy:Collision_Cylinder\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Collision Cylinder\">collision cylinders</a> are all measured\
      \ in these units. The <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_World\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal\
      \ World\">Unreal World</a> can have a maximum size of 65536 UU (=2^16) in Unreal/UT.\
      \ UT2003 and U2 have worlds of 524288 UU (=2^19).</p>\n<p>One UU doesn't actually\
      \ <i>mean</i> anything in the real world, it's just something within the engine.</p>\n\
      <p>An arbitrary scale is used for game programming because the scale may change.\
      \ One game may be an FPS, while another may be a space sim with several planets\
      \ on an entire map. Obviously, because of the constraint on the map size, you\
      \ cannot have a whole planet on a map scaled to an appropriate size for an FPS.\
      \ That is why everything works in abstract \"units.\"</p>\n<p>But each game\
      \ picks a scale to work at: the size of players and objects, which means there\
      \ is an effective conversion factor between UU and real physical units. In the\
      \ Unreal series of games, this is generally held to be roughly:</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>256 UU = 487.68 cm = 16 feet.</li>\n<li>1 meter = 52.5 UU</li>\n<li>1 foot\
      \ = 16 UU</li>\n<li>1 cm = 0.525 UU</li>\n<li>1 UU = 0.75 inches</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>Note that these are approximations. To illustrate, try converting the <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:TournamentPlayer\" title=\"Legacy:TournamentPlayer\">TournamentPlayer</a>\
      \ (UT) dimensions listed here to the 16 units/foot and 12 units/foot scale and\
      \ you will find that although the 12 units/foot scale is more reasonable, neither\
      \ is quite right.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Scale</td>\n<td>TournamentPlayer(UT)\

      \ 16 units/foot makes sense for DeusEx but not for UT (unless the players are\
      \ meant to be dwarves!) The 12 units/foot scale gives a reasonable player height\
      \ for UT and works well if you think in inches (1uu=1in). Using 1uu=.9375in.\
      \ gives a very similar player height and works well for larger distances where\
      \ you tend to think in feet(128uu=10ft).</p>\n<p>Using UnrealEd for other Unreal\
      \ games, e.g. DeusEx or UT2003, is a little different, due to the characters\
      \ being different sizes. Also, there is a slight distortion between the horizontal\
      \ and vertical dimensions. If you were to try to create a replica of a real-world\
      \ structure, the above conversion would make you a giant horizontally, though\
      \ your vertical dimensions would seem only a little small. Therefore you may\
      \ want to use horizontal measurements: 1 meter = 70 units, vertical measurements:\
      \ 1 meter = 60 units.</p>\n<p>UUs are not completely arbitrary: there are some\
      \ things you have to scale to that you can't change. Specifically, light and\
      \ sound have radii that have a set range, which you can't change. If you don't\
      \ scale appropriately to the max limits of lightradius and soundradius, you\
      \ will either lose resolution on those controls (if your world is too small)\
      \ or be unable to make those things big enough. (if your world is too large).\
      \ Also, the engine will not render anything that's more than about 60000 UUs\
      \ away from the camera (the far clipping plane), and if you make things too\
      \ small the loss of precision when the engine converts various things from float\
      \ point to integers becomes significant.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ But at 1uu = 0.5inch, that makes him 6' 9\" (including full gear), requires\

      \ 8.5mph (could sprint a mile in 7 min, if he could keep up that pace, assuming\
      \ that's 300uu/s). Can anyone confirm this change in scale for UE3?</p>\n<h2><span\

    text: "This page is in the process of being cleaned up.\n\nMaterial has been moved\
      \ to:\n* [[Legacy:Unreal Unit|Unreal Unit]] &ndash; what UUs represent, how\
      \ to convert them, etc\n* [[Legacy:Movement Metrics (UT)|Movement metrics (UT)]]\
      \ &ndash; how far players can move, run, jump, etc\n* [[Legacy:Movement Metrics\
      \ (UT2003)|Movement metrics (UT2003)]]\n* [[Legacy:Movement Metrics (UT2004)|Movement\
      \ Metrics (UT2004)]]\n\n==Units & Scale ==\n\nThe [[Legacy:Unreal Engine|Unreal\
      \ engine]] uses two units: \n\n===Length ===\n\nUnreal Units, or UU. Often simply\
      \ called \"units\", or even not given a name at all (\"build a 256x256x64 box\"\
      ). The UnrealEd [[Legacy:Grid|grid]], dimensions of [[Legacy:Brush|brush]]es,\
      \ positions of [[Legacy:Actor|actor]]s and sizes of [[Legacy:Collision Cylinder|collision\
      \ cylinder]]s are all measured in these units. The [[Legacy:Unreal World|Unreal\
      \ World]] can have a maximum size of 65536 UU (=2^16) in Unreal/UT. UT2003 and\
      \ U2 have worlds of 524288 UU (=2^19). \n\nOne UU doesn't actually ''mean''\
      \ anything in the real world, it's just something within the engine. \n\nAn\
      \ arbitrary scale is used for game programming because the scale may change.\
      \ One game may be an FPS, while another may be a space sim with several planets\
      \ on an entire map. Obviously, because of the constraint on the map size, you\
      \ cannot have a whole planet on a map scaled to an appropriate size for an FPS.\
      \ That is why everything works in abstract \"units.\" \n\nBut each game picks\
      \ a scale to work at: the size of players and objects, which means there is\
      \ an effective conversion factor between UU and real physical units. In the\
      \ Unreal series of games, this is generally held to be roughly:\n\n* 256 UU\
      \  = 487.68 cm = 16 feet. \n* 1 meter = 52.5 UU\n* 1 foot  = 16 UU\n* 1 cm =\
      \ 0.525 UU\n* 1 UU = 0.75 inches\n\nNote that these are approximations. To illustrate,\
      \ try converting the [[Legacy:TournamentPlayer|TournamentPlayer]] (UT) dimensions\
      \ listed here to the 16 units/foot and 12 units/foot scale and you will find\
      \ that although the 12 units/foot scale is more reasonable, neither is quite\
      \ right.\n\n{|\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |Scale\n|TournamentPlayer(UT) height =\
      \ 78uu\n|JCDenton(DX) height = 95uu\n|-\n|256uu\n|128uu\n|1uu\n|Player height(UT)\n\
      |Player height(DX)\n|-\n|16ft(192in)\n|8ft(96in)\n|.75in.\n|4'11\"\n|5'11\"\n\
      |-\n|20ft(240in)\n|10ft(120in)\n|.9375in.\n|6'1\"\n|7'5\"\n|-\n|256in(21.3ft)\n\
      |128in(10.67ft)\n|1in.\n|6'6\"\n|7'11\"\n|-\n|6in\n|3in\n|.0234375in\n|1.83\"\
      \ (Giant scale map!)\n|2.23\"\n|}\n\nLooking at player heights, 16 units/foot\
      \ makes sense for DeusEx but not for UT (unless the players are meant to be\
      \ dwarves!) The 12 units/foot scale gives a reasonable player height for UT\
      \ and works well if you think in inches (1uu=1in). Using 1uu=.9375in. gives\
      \ a very similar player height and works well for larger distances where you\
      \ tend to think in feet(128uu=10ft).\n\nUsing UnrealEd for other Unreal games,\
      \ e.g. DeusEx or UT2003, is a little different, due to the characters being\
      \ different sizes.  Also, there is a slight distortion between the horizontal\
      \ and vertical dimensions.  If you were to try to create a replica of a real-world\
      \ structure, the above conversion would make you a giant horizontally, though\
      \ your vertical dimensions would seem only a little small.  Therefore you may\
      \ want to use horizontal measurements:  1 meter = 70 units, vertical measurements:\
      \ 1 meter = 60 units. \n\nUUs are not completely arbitrary: there are some things\
      \ you have to scale to that you can't change. Specifically, light and sound\
      \ have radii that have a set range, which you can't change. If you don't scale\
      \ appropriately to the max limits of lightradius and soundradius, you will either\
      \ lose resolution on those controls (if your world is too small) or be unable\
      \ to make those things big enough. (if your world is too large).  Also, the\
      \ engine will not render anything that's more than about 60000 UUs away from\
      \ the camera (the far clipping plane), and if you make things too small the\
      \ loss of precision when the engine converts various things from float point\
      \ to integers becomes significant.\n\n====UT2004 Scale====\n\nUT2004 appears\
      \ to be using 1 meter = 50 unreal units scale.\n* The UT2004's Karma physics\
      \ engine uses 1 karma unit = 50 unreal units scale internally.\n* Player is\
      \ 88 unreal units high, that's 1.76m, an average [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human#Physiology_and_genetics\
      \ human male height].\n* Player running speed is 440 unreal units per second,\
      \ that's 8.8m/s, an average speed of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres\
      \ 400m runner].\n\n===Angle===\n\nUnreal Rotation Units are used to measure\
      \ angles, to set the direction and rotation of actors for example. 65536 (=2^16)\
      \ is a full circle. These units are used by [[Legacy:Rotator|rotator]]s, a special\
      \ UnrealScript variable type. An actor's orientation is given by a rotator in\
      \ the property Movement -> Rotation.\n\nNot all angles in unreal use these units\
      \ though:\n* Maths functions such as sin() use radians.\n* When importing a\
      \ mesh into the engine with an [[Legacy:Exec Directive|exec directive]], you\
      \ can specify a rotation for the mesh during import ('# EXEC MESH ORIGIN MESH=Blablabla\
      \ YAW=..PITCH=..YAW=...) . In this case the rotation unit is a byte: a full\
      \ circle is 255.\n\n{|\n\n|-\n|'''Value'''\n|'''Degrees'''\n|'''Remarks''' \n\

      \ conversion, you can use a [[Legacy:Scripting_Operators|postoperator]] for\

      \ fairly global...\nstatic final postoperator float Meters( float Units )\n\
      { return Units * Meter; }\n\nstatic final postoperator float MPS( float Units\
      \ )\n{ return Units Meters; }\n\nfunction SetSomething()\n{\n  SetCollisionSize(\
      \ 5 Meters, 3 Meters );\n  Velocity = Vector( Rotation ) * 5 MPS;\n}\n</uscript>\n\

      \ not change this in the original UT, although some mods have implemented it\
      \ ([[Legacy:Jailbreak|Jailbreak]]). \n\nHumans in UT are represented by the\
      \ class [[Legacy:TournamentPlayer|TournamentPlayer]]. To check other classes\
      \ without having to add one to a map, right-click in the [[Legacy:Actor Classes|Actor\
      \ Classes]] browser, open the default properties and look in the [[Legacy:Actor\
      \ (UT)/Collision|collision properties]]. Remember these give the radius and\
      \ half the height: in this case, a CollisionHeight of 39 means the actor's cylinder\
      \ is 78 units tall.\n\n==Movement ==\n\nFor the maxmimum and minimum distances\
      \ players are able to move, see:\n* [[Legacy:Movement Metrics (UT)|Movement\
      \ metrics (UT)]]\n* [[Legacy:Movement Metrics (UT2003)|Movement metrics (UT2003)]]\n\
      \n==Player Environment==\n\n===Ceilings===\n* Absolute minimum: 83 units\n*\
      \ Recommended: 128 units\n\nFrom experience, it is known that a Player can walk\
      \ into any room 83 Units or higher (the engine has the Player bobbing up and\
      \ down), and cannot walk into a room with a height less than 83. It is suggested\
      \ that rooms be designed a minimum of 128 units in height. \n\nFor best results,\
      \ the ceiling should always be at least two feet above the player's head, and\
      \ it looks best when significantly higher. In regular domestic architecture,\
      \ ceilings under 10 feet high are uncommon.\n\n===Hallways===\n* Absolute minimum:\
      \ 48 units\n* Recommended: \n\nThese must be a minimum of 48 units wide, and,\
      \ this is generally considered too narrow for [[Legacy:Bot Pathing|Bot Pathing]].\
      \  PathNodes should be placed at intersections and turns so that there is as\
      \ much clearance as possible from corners (at least 50 world units if possible).\
      \  And PathNodes should be clear to the width of the maximum width (twice the\
      \ CollisionRadius) of creatures which will use this path.  See also [[Legacy:Bot\
      \ Support|Bot Support]].\n\nWhen creating a passage that must be crouched through,\
      \ the minimum ceiling height is 66 units, the minimum hall width is 52 units,\
      \ and the maximums are 1 less than the minimum values described above for normal\
      \ hallways.\n\n===Steps ===\n* Maximum: 24 units\n* Recommended: 16 units\n\n\
      TournamentPlayers can climb any step that is 24 units or less. Using 16 as default\
      \ stepheight is a smart thing to do, because stuff will align to the grid better\
      \ that way.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' has this increased in UT2003? I seem to be able\
      \ to do 32.\n\n===Jumps ===\n* Approx. maximum jump up a step: 64 - 72\n\nIt\
      \ is generally reported that the ability of Players to jump to some maximum\
      \ height in game varies somewhat. Typically, all Players can jump up to a height\
      \ of about 64 units, and cannot reach 72 units without JumpBoots. \n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ Could the variation be due to the bobbing up and down mentioned in 'Ceilings'?\n\
      \n====Some things that might be handy to know====\n\nDoes anyone know these?\n\
      * Equivalent minimum distances that Player can maneuver in Low Gravity and Water\
      \ environments.\\\n* Normal running speed of a bot or a player (so we don't\
      \ make a house with a room which takes 15 seconds to cross - i.e., out of proportion)\n\
      * Normal silent creeping speed of a player\n* Maximum horizontal distance cleared\
      \ from an impact hammer jump.\n* Maximum distance of dodges, sideways, backwards\
      \ & forwards  \n* Maximum distance the translocator can be thrown.\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ It appears the maximum vertical distance a translocator can be thrown in normal\
      \ gravity is 1536 units.  Fancy math should be able to determine horizontal\
      \ distance with normal gravity and a 45&deg; angle.\n\n'''MarZer:''' Using a\
      \ small projectile motion program I wrote a whole back, I came up with the following\
      \ figures (variables used shown):\n\nVelocity 1200 UUs<sup>-1-</sup>, Angle\
      \ 45°, Gravity -950UUs<sup>-2-</sup>\n\nMaximum height 378.947368421053 UU,\n\
      \nHorizontal displacement 1.51578947368421 x10<sup>3</sup> UU,\n\nTime of flight\
      \ 0.893187513077744 s  :-)\n\n'''CMan:''' Doing a dodge however will change\
      \ the distances, much like a double jump would raise the height.  I suppose\
      \ you could get the velocity modifiers from the Code of xPawn to get the max.\n\
      \n===Slopes===\n* A slope less than 20 degrees behaves exactly like a floor\
      \ (and is actually considered a floor). Players can move on these without obstruction.\n\
      * A slope between 20 and 35 degrees is a grade. The player can move up these\
      \ but he/she slides and must continually struggle to climb to avoid sliding\
      \ all the way down. \n* A slope over 35 degrees is unclimbable. \n\n'''KingMango:'''\
      \ Since when? I hesitate to edit this page but the slope info seems to be way\
      \ off. I don't slide on any slope 45 degrees or less.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' This\
      \ section ''could'' be referring to UT99.  I agree that UT2k3 and later seem\
      \ to be more forgiving on slopes.\n\n==Tips==\n\nMany experienced mappers place\
      \ a model of a player in a prominent location when designing the level.\n* Actor\
      \ >> Decoration >> Introdude\n* Actor >> Pawn >> Bot >> HumanBotPlus >> ''one\
      \ of the child classes''\n\nIntrodude is exactly the same height as the '''TournamentPlayer'''\
      \ when set at a drawscale (in the Properties window) of 1.075. \n: I've had\
      \ intermittent problems with an Introdude simply not showing in any view except\
      \ Wireframe, so I use a bot. Anyone know why this might happen?  &rarr;[[Legacy:Tarquin|Tarquin]]\
      \ \n\nA good way of checking to see if bots will take an odd path is to try\
      \ to set a pathnode in the region. Some brushes (128 units high) vertex edited\
      \ up or down will be ok for a player to run through, but some bots will not\
      \ take the path. Try setting a pathnode on the slope by right clicking and selecting\
      \ \"Set Pathnode Here (don't duplicate or move a pathnode there). If it appears,\
      \ you're set. If not, you may want to change your brush.\n\n==Discussion==\n\
      \n'''Niaht:''' I would like to suggest moving the \"Scale\" section to the top\
      \ of the document. It seems to be good information to prep for reading the specs\
      \ on the actors, player environment and other information. It was also one of\
      \ my first questions when I started working in UnrealEd and I think would be\
      \ canidate for entry into a kind of Mapping Quick Ref (is there one already?).\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:'''  Done :) Some of the pathnoding stuff under Hallways and Tip\

      \ />On the subject of a Mapping Quick Ref: we have [[Legacy:UnrealEd Tips|UnrealEd\

      \ for scale reference in UT200X? I haven't really been into mapping since UT\n\
      \n'''UltraNew-B:'''  There is a handy universal uu conversion calculator here:\
      \ http://home.tiscali.nl/ariadohq/tutes/uu_convert.html\n\n----\n\n'''BobTheBeheader:'''\n\
      \nI'm a real n00b, so I'm not to sure how a postprocessor is implemented by\
      \ UnrealEd, although I understand the concept. Could someone please elaborate?\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' What do you mean by a postprocessor in this context?\n\n'''Kirk'''\
      \ I think he meant the bit about the postoperator. See [[Legacy:Scripting_Operators|Scripting_Operators]].\n\
      \n----\n\n'''Tidalwv:''' Is there information out there on the optimal surface\
      \ angle for wall jumping (Climbing a surface with a slope > 35 degrees by jumping\
      \ up against it) or if there is a height at which it becomes ineffective?\n\n\
      ----\n\n'''Geist:'''  Hmmm... it seems that UE3 must be using a different scale?\
      \  Like maybe 1uu = 0.5 inch?  In a recent interview, Lead Level Designer ''Lee\
      \ Perry'' had this to say about Marcus Fenix in ''Gears of War'' (http://gearsofwar.com/BehindTheScenes/Interview_Lee_Perry.htm):\n\
      \n; Gamers love Marcus Fenix. If you had to describe Marcus to someone who knows\
      \ nothing about Gears of War, what would you tell them about Marcus?\n: GearPawn_Marcus\
      \ is 162 Unreal units tall, has a 50 unit wide collision cylinder, requires\
      \ 96 units of vertical space to be considered “in cover”, has a default health\
      \ value as well as movement rate of 300, has 50 bones, 2048x2048 texture resolution,\
      \ and 12,570 polygons. That’s pretty much how I see Marcus.\n\nNow, using UE2\
      \ conversions, this would put Marcus at over 10 ft tall!  But at 1uu = 0.5inch,\
      \ that makes him 6' 9\" (including full gear), requires 4' for cover, is 2'\
      \ 1\" wide (collision to the shoulders), and moves at about 8.5mph (could sprint\
      \ a mile in 7 min, if he could keep up that pace, assuming that's 300uu/s).\
      \  Can anyone confirm this change in scale for UE3?\n\n==Related Topics ==\n\
