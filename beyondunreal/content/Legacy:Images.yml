      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Thanks m8. I'll give it a go when I get home (don't want\
      \ to try it from here it might get the site blocked). I assume that fairly long\
      \ filenames are OK - it means I can prefix the images with the tutorial they\
      \ relate to.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I think a lot of the ones that have generic-sounding\
      \ names aren't very good, eg \"Texture Browser\" includes the actor browser\
      \ in shot (which is irrelevant), and is a jpeg (bad quality; use gif for simple\
      \ colours). There's one somewhere I made of the surface flags which I hope is\
      \ generic enough: I positioed the window so the button that opens it would be\

      \ I agree about the generic names (like \"Fig_A\"). Some images should be deleted\
      \ too since they're Wiki-unrelated. Fortunately the image referrer check prevents\

      >image uploader</a> got some enhancements –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Image URLs now contain\
      \ a secured expiration timestamp; they expire five minutes after having been\
      \ generated. Linking to images in the wiki image database from anywhere outside\
      \ the Unreal Wiki is ultimately futile since the links will be valid for no\
      \ more than five minutes.</li>\n<li>For each image, the image uploader displays\
      \ the names of the Unreal Wiki pages the image is used on. Pages that are used\
      \ nowhere are easy to spot (and ElMuerte and I spent some time removing them\
      \ for now).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm also looking into a way to show image uploads\
      \ on <a href=\"/Legacy:Recent_Changes\" title=\"Legacy:Recent Changes\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\">Recent Changes</a> just like page edits.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b>Will\
      \ linking within the wiki to images that are actually being used for the wiki\
      \ purposes not allow the 5min expiration to affect the picture being linked\
      \ too?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> The wiki image embedding markup (<code>@block@imagename</code>\
      \ etc.) automatically generates the required timestamp when the page is rendered.\
      \ Assuming a browser starts loading the images contained in a wiki page within\
      \ five minutes of starting to load the page itself, all images will be displayed\
      \ properly; but taking the image URL out of the rendered HTML will yield an\
      \ address that'll expire shortly.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> That sounds pretty\
      \ neat!&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> I hope it'll turn out useful&#160;:-)\
      \ – I've now also added logging of image uploads and deletions on <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Recent_Changes\" title=\"Legacy:Recent Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      >Recent Changes</a> (you might have noticed). Known issue: Even for wikizens\
      \ who are logged in, it'll only display the host address instead of the name.\
      \ I'll look into that later.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> It's not the host address\
      \ of the user who modified the image, but the address of the user who views\
      \ Recent Changes. BTW: I just reverted one and deleted two other images.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Graphik:</b> Also, Mych, when I deleted a pic called NormaN (which was\
      \ some stupid mug shot), it listed my host on RC not only as the one who deleted\
      \ the image but also the uploader of the image. Do we (by \"we\" meaning the\
      \ creator of the image and myself) concidentally have the same host, or is this\
      \ a bug?</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> This is what I tried to say above.&#160;:) It's\
      \ a bug.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Bwaaah. What an idiotic bug. The IPs are logged\
      \ correctly, they're just not displayed. I'll upload a fix later when BeyondUnreal\
      \ has sorted out its FTP connectivity problems.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Fixed\
      \ it, and now it also displays the user name on <a href=\"/Legacy:Recent_Changes\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Recent Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Recent Changes</a>.</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte:</b> Mychaeel, how do you identify deleted images in the rclog?\
      \ I'm updating the mozilla sidebar code to cope with the new image rclog hack.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Is there a way to revert images? The \"changes\" link on recent\
      \ changes lists previous revisions, and lets you view them, but does not seem\
      \ to provide an easy way to revert other than saving the image to your harddrive\
      \ and uploading it again.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> I'd say that's the way to\
      \ go to revert images. I could add extra functionality to allow users to directly\
      \ revert to a previous revision, but I fear that doing so might open even more\
      \ doors to easy abuse.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> arg, ok, the \"delete\" feature\
      \ in the changelog of an images doesn't delete the most recent image, but deletes\
      \ them all. That wasn't very clear.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Well, it <i>does</i>\
      \ only delete the most recent image (the \"Current Revision\"). What it doesn't\
      \ do – and what you expected, it seems – is <i>un</i>deleting the <i>previous</i>\
      \ image revision. Thinking of it, I could probably add a feature which reverts\
      \ an image to a certain revision by moving the most recent revision to the trash\
      \ and undeleting the selected older revision.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

    text: "Before you upload an image, please take note:\n\n==Image tips==\n\n===Avoid\
      \ duplication===\n\nBefore you even make a screenshot, please take a look at\
      \ [[:Category:Legacy Basic Procedure]]s and [[Legacy:UnrealEd Interface|UnrealEd\
      \ Interface]]. There are plenty of images of various parts of UnrealEd, so you\
      \ may be able to reuse those.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Guidelines On Tutorials|Guidelines\
      \ on Tutorials]].\n\n===File Names===\n\nImages are stored in a flat list, so\
      \ it's important to give your image file a descriptive name.\n\n; For tutorials:\
      \ {name of tutorial page}-{description or number}\n\n; Interface screenshots\
      \ : interface-Ed3-{something descriptive}\n\n(we're using dash (-) as a separator\
      \ because:\n* Mychaeel dislikes the use of dots to separate parts of a file\
      \ name; they are, in his opinion, reserved for the file extension. (and fair\
      \ enough :) )\n* underscores look ugly, especially because they're disproportionally\
      \ wide in most proportional fonts. They're also a pain to type because they're\
      \ shifted.)\n\n===File Sizes===\n\n\"800x600\" Landscape.\n\n===Rough style\
      \ notes===\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'm slowly working on new screenies of the interface.\
      \ rough notes for common style:\n\n* font: Arial 16 plain\n\n==Problems ==\n\
      \n===Ugly PNGs in IE===\n\nSome [[Wikipedia:PNG]] images on the site are made\
      \ with an [[Wikipedia:alpha channel]]. This is so they blend with different\
      \ colour backgrounds. \n\nUnfortunately, IE does not support PNG alpha channels\
      \ correctly. Instead of the page background colour, you'll see grey (or some\
      \ other colour from your Windows appearance settings). So unless you change\
      \ browsers, you'll get \"ugly but functional\".\n\n==Renaming (admin only) ==\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' I'm planning on hacking the wiki script to do regular search\
      \ & replace, so renaming images should be easier.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Warning.\
      \  Abuse of such a feature has the potential to wreck the entire site if it's\
      \ publicly available. &ndash; We could also update the image uploader to enforce\
      \ certain syntactical rules for image names.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I meant for admin-only:\
      \ I'll tack it into the page-renaming utility, since it does a S&R itself to\
      \ update links.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' If I rename image files via FTP access, will\
      \ that upset anything?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' You should rename the previous versions\
      \ in the \"deleted\" subdirectory accordingly too, or they'll be \"detached\"\
      \ from the current version in the main image directory.  Otherwise, nothing\
      \ bad can happen.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' So seeing my ip/hostname on all the deleted\
      \ pictures are normal :|\n\n==Image Management==\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Is there\
      \ any way of viewing all of the images that have been uploaded to the web site?\
      \  I'll be needing to upload a bunch of images for the tutorials I'm going to\
      \ be doing, but don't want to needlessly duplicate images if I don't have to.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' The image uploader page lists them all. I can put up a 2nd\
      \ version of that page that loads all the images too, as thumbnails, but it'll\
      \ be  a long load. \n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' That's OK - I have a big pipe :).\
      \  It would be useful.  Unless you can think of another way of searching for\
      \ images.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I have a cigar. I'll fiddle with the cgi, see if\
      \ it's as simple as I hope it is\n\n'''Tarquin:''' ok, try http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/imageupload.cgi/wiki-ext/imageupload_thumb.htt\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' Thanks m8.  I'll give it a go when I get home (don't want\
      \ to try it from here it might get the site blocked).  I assume that fairly\
      \ long filenames are OK - it means I can prefix the images with the tutorial\
      \ they relate to.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I think a lot of the ones that have generic-sounding\
      \ names aren't very good, eg \"Texture Browser\" includes the actor browser\
      \ in shot (which is irrelevant), and is a jpeg (bad quality; use gif for simple\
      \ colours). There's one somewhere I made of the surface flags which I hope is\
      \ generic enough: I positioed the window so the button that opens it would be\
      \ in-shot too .. (neat or wot?). \n\nIt seems we have a lot of dross:\n* What\
      \ the hell is the Nikon pic? ''it was a camera :rolleyes:, deleted''\n* the\
      \ spinning \"email\" logo? gah? it goes, IMO ''deleted''\n* who is Picf0019\
      \ ? ''dunno, deleted''\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I agree about the generic names  (like\
      \ \"Fig_A\").  Some images should be deleted too since they're Wiki-unrelated.\
      \  Fortunately the image referrer check prevents that sort of abuse.\n\n* http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/images/icesig\
      \ &ndash; forum signature image. ''deleted''\n* http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/images/Picf0019\
      \ &ndash; some private wedding picture. ''deleted (poor photographing skills\
      \ btw. ;))''\n\nIf you want to replace a poor JPEG-encoded user interface screenshot\
      \ by a better GIF or PNG one, use the image uploader's \"Replace image\" functionality.\n\
      \nIt seems we have a lot of dross:\n* loads of stuff that's too dark\n* too\
      \ big\n* personal map screenshots: which ones are used in tutes, which ones\
      \ are just \"here's a map I made\"? \n\nAnd the \"what the hell are these\"\
      \ bucket:\n\n:''(bucket is empty :))''\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Delete 'em.  And I'll\
      \ add a note to the image uploader that remote linking isn't possible.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Done.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Having the name of the user who uploaded (maybe also\
      \ deleted) an image like on [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent Changes]] would be\
      \ nice.\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Or a column in the image uploading area that says\
      \ who uploaded the picture.\n\n:'''Mychaeel:''' That'd mean I'd have to keep\
      \ track of that in an extra database file.  Right now everything is saved in\
      \ and by the file system.  We do have the IPs/hostnames of the people that uploaded\
      \ those files though.\n::'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Ok\n\n'''Wormbo:''' That's what\
      \ I meant. Is there any reason why the pictures above shouldn't be deleted?\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' Nope. kill 'em!\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Deleted the pics.\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:'''\
      \ Got rid of those red x's.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' The [http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/imageupload.cgi/wiki-ext/imageupload.htt\
      \ image uploader] got some enhancements &ndash;\n* Image URLs now contain a\
      \ secured expiration timestamp; they expire five minutes after having been generated.\
      \  Linking to images in the wiki image database from anywhere outside the Unreal\
      \ Wiki is ultimately futile since the links will be valid for no more than five\
      \ minutes.\n* For each image, the image uploader displays the names of the Unreal\
      \ Wiki pages the image is used on.  Pages that are used nowhere are easy to\
      \ spot (and ElMuerte and I spent some time removing them for now).\n\nI'm also\
      \ looking into a way to show image uploads on [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent\
      \ Changes]] just like page edits.\n\n'''MythOpus:'''Will linking within the\
      \ wiki to images that are actually being used for the wiki purposes not allow\
      \ the 5min expiration to affect the picture being linked too?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ The wiki image embedding markup (<code>@block@imagename</code> etc.) automatically\
      \ generates the required timestamp when the page is rendered.  Assuming a browser\
      \ starts loading the images contained in a wiki page within five minutes of\
      \ starting to load the page itself, all images will be displayed properly; but\
      \ taking the image URL out of the rendered HTML will yield an address that'll\
      \ expire shortly.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' That sounds pretty neat! :)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ I hope it'll turn out useful :-) &ndash; I've now also added logging of image\
      \ uploads and deletions on [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent Changes]] (you might\
      \ have noticed).  Known issue:  Even for wikizens who are logged in, it'll only\
      \ display the host address instead of the name.  I'll look into that later.\n\
      \n'''Wormbo:''' It's not the host address of the user who modified the image,\
      \ but the address of the user who views Recent Changes. BTW: I just reverted\
      \ one and deleted two other images.\n\n'''Graphik:''' Also, Mych, when I deleted\
      \ a pic called NormaN (which was some stupid mug shot), it listed my host on\
      \ RC not only as the one who deleted the image but also the uploader of the\
      \ image. Do we (by \"we\" meaning the creator of the image and myself) concidentally\
      \ have the same host, or is this a bug?\n\n'''Wormbo:''' This is what I tried\
      \ to say above. :) It's a bug.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Bwaaah. What an idiotic bug.\
      \ The IPs are logged correctly, they're just not displayed. I'll upload a fix\
      \ later when BeyondUnreal has sorted out its FTP connectivity problems.\n\n\
      '''Mychaeel:''' Fixed it, and now it also displays the user name on [[Legacy:Recent\
      \ Changes|Recent Changes]].\n\n'''El Muerte:''' Mychaeel, how do you identify\
      \ deleted images in the rclog? I'm updating the mozilla sidebar code to cope\
      \ with the new image rclog hack.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Is there a way to revert images?\
      \ The \"changes\" link on recent changes lists previous revisions, and lets\
      \ you view them, but does not seem to provide an easy way to revert other than\
      \ saving the image to your harddrive and uploading it again.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ I'd say that's the way to go to revert images.  I could add extra functionality\
      \ to allow users to directly revert to a previous revision, but I fear that\
      \ doing so might open even more doors to easy abuse.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' arg,\
      \ ok, the \"delete\" feature in the changelog of an images doesn't delete the\
      \ most recent image, but deletes them all. That wasn't very clear.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Well, it ''does'' only delete the most recent image (the \"Current Revision\"\
      ).  What it doesn't do &ndash; and what you expected, it seems &ndash; is ''un''deleting\
      \ the ''previous'' image revision.  Thinking of it, I could probably add a feature\
      \ which reverts an image to a certain revision by moving the most recent revision\
      \ to the trash and undeleting the selected older revision.\n\n==Requests==\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' The two images I need right now are the \"static mesh browser\"\
      \ button, and the \"add volume\" button.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' They're already in.\
      \ See [[Legacy:Add A Volume|Add a volume]] and [[Legacy:Static Mesh Browser|Static\
      \ mesh browser]] :)\n\n'''CH3Z:''' requested on [[Legacy:Wiki_Development|Wiki_Development]]\
      \ Header: \"Game Logo Smileys\"\n\nut.png, ut2003.png, devastation.png and so\
      \ on.\n\n16x16- alpha-channelled-  without an antialiased edge. \n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Um. I thought you said you'd do these? nm, I can do the UT & UT2003 ones at\
      \ least. Mych? Any idea for filenames?\n\n'''CH3Z:''' I was afraid I might have\
      \ taken the discussion down prematurely. I said I would make them when they\
      \ were going to be gifs. But I don't have experience with png's. Those are the\
      \ file names Mych asked for with different extensions now. I see you figured\
      \ out that the full discussion is in revision 184 of [[Legacy:Wiki Development|Wiki\
      \ Development]] and I saw your notes. Gotcha, I'll get a better feel for this.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' I'm doing: U1, UT, UT2003, Devastation."
