      <p>Basically, all of what I just described.</p>\n<p>I'll never understand why\
      \ some people think that the defenders are supposed to make life easy on the\
      \ attackers. As far as I know, the only goal of any game is to win. In order\
      \ to win, a team must do whatever it takes short of actual cheating (see below)\
      \ to score more points/goals/kills than the other team.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"\

      \ to be sexually unfaithful</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I'm relatively sure that\
      \ nobody is being sexually unfaithful to someone while playing a game like UT2003,\
      \ the first two definitions are probably what concern us. \"to practice fraud\
      \ or trickery\" is somewhat vague, but the second bit, \"to violate rules dishonestly\"\
      , now <i><b>that</b></i> sounds like what we're looking for. The question now\
      \ would be: is camping (by the popular definition) cheating?</p>\n<p>How <i>can</i>\
      \ it be? There are no rules to violate on this subject. Standing still is not\
      \ a violation of any rule, nor is hiding in a dark corner. Even \"spawn camping\"\
      \ isn't against any rules. So, if camping (by the popular definition) isn't\
      \ cheating, and the whole point of playing is to win by any means necessary\
      \ (short of actual cheating), then what's the problem?</p>\n<p>In fact, the\
      \ only rules in UT2003 for example, are the rules laid out in the EULA as put\
      \ forth in the manual. You're not allowed to hack the game or otherwise change\
      \ the game in such a way that it gives you an unfair advantage. That means no\
      \ bots and no hacks. You know what it <b>doesn't</b> mean? It doesn't mean that\
      \ \"camping\" is against the rules. It actually means that \"camping\" is well\
      \ within the rules. It also doesn't mean that a person is cheating when they\
      \ use a transparent skin, or one that is entirely black. True, people like that\
      \ are pathetic losers who have no sense of decency or fun, but they're not cheaters.</p>\n\
      <p><i>And if they're not cheating, then they're doing everything possible to\

      \ According to the popular definition of a camper, I certainly am one. I like\

      \ me to keep an eye on my flag and repel the invaders, then hell yes, I'm going\
      \ to do that. I will leave it up to other members of my team to go on offense.\
      \ If I'm playing a map with UT-style Sniper Rifles, or a Zark mod, I will do\
      \ my best to get up somewhere high where I can pick people off. What's the point\
      \ of having a Sniper Rifle with a nifty zoom feature if you're just going to\
      \ use it like a pistol or assault rifle? People, if you're playing a map/mod\
      \ that way, do yourself a favor and just leave and play somewhere else. The\
      \ best players use the weapons they've been given in creative and effective\
      \ ways. Perching on a high point and headshot-ing enemies from across the map\
      \ is <b>very</b> effective. One thing I don't do though is intentional spawn-killing.\

      \ who scream \"CAMPER!\" the loudest are the ones that have just lost a match\
      \ and are looking to blame anything or anyone but themselves. When that happens,\
      \ logic goes right out the window.\n\nTry to accept that there are players better\
      \ than you out there (and don't even get me started about people who Cry Bot).\n\
      \n===Comments===\n\n'''GRAF1K:''' If you can meet their silly rules (while still\
      \ winning), by all means do so!\n\nSome things, like spawn camping, kill the\
      \ fun of the game, but aren't cheating. There is more than one server they can\
      \ go to.\n\nInvisible skins, though, are the essence of \"change[ing] the game\
      \ in such a way that it gives you an unfair advantage\".\n\nWhiners will always\
      \ be there, but in the end they're no fun to play against anyway. Again, there's\
      \ more than one server running in the world. Just ignore whiners &ndash; that's\
      \ always fun. ;-)\n\n'''Solid Snake:''' If someone ruins gameplay fun I usually\
      \ think that it is kind of bad. Camping can do this, but it depends. I like\
      \ to guard my places, especially in bombing run but that doesn't make me a camper.\
      \ Well, I usually make mods which don't have sniper rifles in them anyways...\
      \ or at least with FOV alterations.\n\n==Rush in Rio==\n\nQ: Russian Rio...\
      \ isn't that a drink?\n\nA: No.\n\nThe rest of this rant is coming shortly.\n\
      \n'''Dark Pulse:''' Erm, OK.\n\n----\n\n===Comments===\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
