      \ here. I wanted to do a remake of Overdose (mpterra1), the large, S-shaped\
      \ outdoor map that comes with Quake III: Team Arena. I still do. CTF-Pratt didn't\
      \ quite make it, though I'm happy with the way it came out in the end. Where\
      \ Overdose is a dirt-and-grass-style terrain map, Pratt is a metallic S-shaped\
      \ valley, with a base at the ends of the S and a lookout post on the curves\
      \ of the S. There is a weapons building for each team close to the bases, and\
      \ a water pit that divides the map, like a line in a dollar sign – $. The part\
      \ that I remember most about making this map was trying to get the coronas right.\
      \ I didn't use any for Lerxst, and it must have taken me two or three days to\

      \ work on Lerxst and Pratt on my own, in my own time. A while later, I saw an\
      \ ad for the aforementioned LanCombat tournament, and since I live down the\
      \ street from where it was taking place, I emailed Thrullas and asked if there\
      \ was anything I could do to help. He asked if I knew how to make maps for UT,\
      \ and I lied and said yes&#160;;). He told me that he was looking for six maps\
      \ to use in the tournament, maps that had not been in the public domain before.\
      \ I told him I could handle that, as I already had 2 (mostly) done, and the\
      \ tournament was still several months away. CTF-Dirk was the first map I worked\
      \ on for the tournament. It's pretty standard CTF fare, with a flag base at\
      \ either end of a long hallway, but there are multiple side rooms and a pretty\
      \ cool second level with a glass floor that looks down onto the bottom floor.\
      \ This was the first map that I put hidden rooms into as well, with redeemers\
      \ and damage modifiers behind the team symbols. This map is named after the\
      \ final member of Rush, Geddy \"Dirk\" Lee... can you tell I'm a fan?</p>\n\

      \ tournament called for 3 CTF and 3 DM maps, and this was the first DM map I\
      \ worked on. I always liked the outer space maps in UT, and this map took some\
      \ inspiration from CTF-Romra. The main area is a large platform (heh) with a\
      \ structure in the middle. Surrounding this platform, at varying heights, are\
      \ 14 smaller platforms with teleports between them. The whole level is low gravity\
      \ – the only low grav map here. I got the hang of the coronas when working on\
      \ Pratt, and used them pretty liberally on this map.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ with any pre-production on this, I just new that I wanted a gothic DM-Curse\
      \ kinda feel to it. I started with a small room, then just added hallways and\
      \ other rooms as I felt like it. I connected everything with various stairs\
      \ and ramps, and there are several levels to the map. One of the coolest features\
      \ I think is the pair of giant winding stairs. The room that houses the stairs\
      \ is circular with a large radius, and several rooms break off the stairway\
      \ as you go up it. This was the first map that I started playing around with\
      \ the 2D Editor on. I used it for several curved passageways. My only regret\
      \ is that I didn't give it a more unique name, but I was pressed for time and\
