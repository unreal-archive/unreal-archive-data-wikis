      \ tabs, which we'll call the <b>Terrain Layers tabs</b>. This is where you select\

      \ title=\"Edit section: The different tools and the brush\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>All the tools have the same\
      \ basic interaction interface. Pick a tool from the list by clicking on it.\
      \ You mostly use them all in the 3D <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Viewport\" title=\"\
      Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport\">UnrealEd viewport</a>, where the active \"brush\"\
      \ is represented by a yellow circle indicating the radius of effec. This yellow\
      \ circle follows the surface of the terrain, and indicates the inner &amp; outer\
      \ radius settings. It's a good idea to set the viewport to \"wiremesh\" view\
      \ to see vertices more clearly, However, if you have already placed a sunlight\
      \ in your map, \"Dynamic\" or \"Lighting only\" make the terrain curvature easier\
      \ to see as well.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to use some of them in an orthogonal\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Viewport\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport\">UnrealEd\
      \ Viewport</a> (the top view is most useful for this). This can make setting\
      \ terrain visibility easier, or painting layers, or painting very specific parts\
      \ of the heightmap. With the viewport in focus, hit 'T' to show terrain: it\
      \ will show textured and lit. It's a good idea to enable the terrain grid visibility\
      \ (in the layers tab, see below).</p>\n<p>You use the <b>control</b> key in\
      \ combination with either the left or right mouse button to use a tool. In general,\
      \ if <b>control + left-mouse</b> does one thing, <b>control + right-mouse</b>\
      \ does the opposite.</p>\n<p>The tools are:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Vertex Editing&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>see <a href=\"/Legacy:Vertex_Editing_Terrain_Tool\" title=\"Legacy:Vertex\
      \ Editing Terrain Tool\">Vertex Editing Terrain Tool</a></dd>\n<dt>Select&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>allows you to select a rectangle, presumably to use the \"generate\" tool\
      \ on a region instead of the whole terrain</dd>\n<dt>Painting&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This\
      \ behaves differently according to whether the Heightmap or a layer is selected\
      \ in the lower three tabs. More: <a href=\"/Legacy:Painting_Terrain_Tool\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Painting Terrain Tool\">Painting Terrain Tool</a></dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dt>Heightmap&#160;</dt>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dt>raise (LMB) or lower (RMB) the terrain\
      \ by an amount determined by strength and adjust. The mouse must be moved to\
      \ effect a change. Set the strength and adjust to quite low with this tool,\
      \ or large changes will result very quickly.</dt>\n<dt>Layer&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Mask\
      \ or un-mask the layer.</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Smoothing&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>This will cause the terrain inside your editing circle to blend together\
      \ and become, well, smoother. This can be looked at as a sort of \"averaging\"\
      \ tool, where everything in the area is averaged together towards a middle height.\
      \ For instance, if you pumped up the radius to much larger than your terrain\
      \ area with strength of 100%, holding down the LMB would cause you to get, eventually,\
      \ a flat piece of terrain with the average elevation that all of your terrain\
      \ had. <b>NOTE</b>: Smoothing off the edge of the terrain is BAD, resulting\
      \ in an instant UnrealEd crash or vertices suddenly pushed all the way to the\
      \ minimum terrain height. Save often. Also, the smoothing tool seems to act\
      \ more quickly on the terrain then other tools. You may want to turn the strength\
      \ to about 1/4 or 1/2 of what you originally intended.</dd>\n<dt>Noise&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>introduces random changes, raising the terrain in random places by an amount\
      \ determined from the strength and adjust. Useful for roughing up flat areas\
      \ to make them look more natural.</dd>\n<dt>Flatten&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Ctrl + LMB\
      \ on a terrain vertex, then wherever you drag the mouse will be set to the height\
      \ of that initial vertex. Useful for creating 'man-made' areas in the terrain\
      \ e.g. roads. Note that this mode is unlike the others in that it does not modify\
      \ the surface gradually, but makes an instantanious change. Use with caution.</dd>\n\
      <dt>Visibility&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This tool is used to show or hide individual\
      \ polygons and regions of the terrain. What you can't see, you can't touch,\
      \ so use this tool to make e.g. entrances to caves that allow the player to\
      \ pass through the terrain. Obviously, you will just drop through any hole to\
      \ the bottom of the containing subtracted brush, so you need to add <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:BSP\" title=\"Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a> geometry around the hole then subtract\
      \ a cave, or put a <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh\"\
      >static mesh</a> there. The tricky bit is aligning the subterranean part seamlessly\
      \ with the terrain. See DM-Antalus for a good example.</dd>\n<dt>Edge Turn&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>This tool rotates the tesselation of a certain face. In wireframe view you\
      \ can see that a terrain map is made up of tesselated squares, but all the tesselation\
      \ goes the same way. If you have sharp edges on your terrain because of extreme\
      \ changes in altitude, use the edge turn tool to switch the verticies that the\
      \ tesselation uses.</dd>\n<dt>Tex Pan&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Slides the texture of\
      \ a layer around. I suppose this would be important if you've got a custom texture\
      \ for the terrain map, otherwise, this has limited use. One good use of this\
      \ is on <a href=\"/Legacy:Terrain_Texture_Layer\" title=\"Legacy:Terrain Texture\
      \ Layer\">Terrain Texture layers</a> where the texture is projected sideways\
      \ onto the terrain, such as for layered rock. Panning allows you to change the\
      \ elevation of the layers.</dd>\n<dt>Tex Rotate&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Rotates the\
      \ texture of a layer, again, limited use.</dd>\n<dt>Tex Scale&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Scales\
      \ the texture of a layer. You can do this more mathematically by opening up\
      \ the terraininfo's properties and flipping through the layers and changing\
      \ their scaling properties.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Most terrain editing is done using\
      \ Painting, Smoothing, Flatten, and occasionally Visibility. The others are\
      \ useful for very fine control.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Tool_Options\"\

      <p>The tools options section changed the settings for the yellow brush you see\
      \ in the 3D window: its size, and how much it affects the terrain. It is <i>very\
      \ important</i>, so get used to it, you'll tweak it often&#160;:). It consists\
      \ of several options:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Per Tool?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Off means all\
      \ tools use the same radii, strenth, and adjust values. On allows each tool\
      \ to have separate settings.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Inner Radius &amp; Outer\
      \ Radius&#160;</dt>\n<dd>The outer radius is the size of the area of effect.\
      \ Some tools, like visibility and flatten, only use the outer radius. They have\
      \ their full effect anywhere they touch. Other tools, such as raising and lowering\
      \ terrain, use the inner radius also. These tools have maximum effect inside\
      \ the inner radius, then drop off to 0 change at the edge of the outer radius.\
      \ Setting the inner and outer radius the same will cause these tools to have\
      \ maximum effect for the whole circle. Setting the inner radius to zero will\
      \ cause a smooth blend from maximum at the center to nothing at the edge. Most\
      \ of the time, people have a small inner radius and a large outer radius.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Lock icon&#160;</dt>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dt>Tie the Inner Radius\
      \ &amp; Outer Radius sliders together, so that they increase and decrease together.\
      \ Useful for having a uniform 'blend edge' while you change the size of the\
      \ brush.</dt>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Strength &amp; Adjust&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>These are sort of like opacity and pressure in Photoshop – they control\
      \ how much the brush does, and how fast it does it. Larger values for Adjust\
      \ and Strength will cause modifications to your terrain to happen much faster\
      \ – often too fast, especially with the smoothing tool.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dt>Ignore Invisible Quads&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Unknown effect. Perhaps broken?</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Mirror&#160;</dt>\n<dd>lets you work on 2 or 4 parts of your\
      \ terrain simultaneously. Great for outdoor CTF or ONS maps.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It's\
      \ pretty intuitive once you've done it a couple of times. When you can see the\
      \ effect of different settings immediately on how fast that hill rises, and\
      \ what its shape is, it becomes quite obvious! Experiment a lot – experimentation\
      \ is rewarded. Recommended settings will be given when treating the individual\
      \ tools, but for an example, here's the settings that I typically use for the\
      \ Smoothing tool:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Inner Radius</b>: 0</dd>\n<dd><b>Outer Radius</b>:\
      \ 1024 or larger (sometimes as high as 8192)</dd>\n<dd><b>Strength</b>: 8%</dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Adjust</b>: 4</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All terrain\
      \ editing is done in the 3D view (use the wiremesh viewmode to see terrain vertices\
      \ more clearly).</li>\n<li>The brush is a bright yellow circlet</li>\n<li>Use\
      \ the <b>control</b> key in combination with holding down the left or right\
      \ mouse buttons to use a tool.</li>\n<li>Strength &amp; Adjust are critical,\
      \ and usually best kept very low for fine editing</li>\n<li>Experiment, experiment,\

      \ Then you can fill this page in yourself&#160;:) And make it easier to follow.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Icedude:</b>We realy need a tutoral on Deco Layers. I cant figure them\
      \ out!</p>\n<p><b>Tahngarth:</b> could we integrate this with <a href=\"/Legacy:Using_The_Terrain_Tool\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Using The Terrain Tool\">Using The Terrain Tool</a> somehow?\
      \ This part seems more a description of the tools than a step-by-step tutorial.\
      \ Part I is quite important and well done tutorial, but this part seems just\
      \ a tool function summary. I'm not sure what to do here, but theres bound to\
      \ be some duplication going on if i finish writing that page now.</p>\n<p><b>ProjectX:</b>\
      \ Ok, i've dun terrain before, and mastered it, I have a cavern set up with\
      \ two terrain actors, one above the other, they used to be using the same heightmap,\
      \ but i changed it. Now, i place playerstarts, and rebuild, they come up with\
      \ \"this player start is not on an even base or neer a steep slope\", i finally\
      \ got that to stop and i tested the game and it said it couldnt find the player\
      \ starts. I had 17 on there and i had rebuilt the level without a single error.\
      \ I tried loading the map up again and it GPFd</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> What\
      \ type of rebuilding did you use? If you did geometry, use the path rebuild\
      \ button. If you did paths, use the geometry rebuild button, and then use the\
      \ path button. That happened to me once.</p>\n<p><b>MadNad:</b> Another interesting\
      \ thing to note that I found was that by increasing the size of your heightmap\
      \ when creating terrain layer from 128x128 to 256x256 makes some pretty crisp\
      \ shadowing, along with longer compiles and lower frames, but still, very cool\
      \ feature.</p>\n<p><b>Tesseract:</b> Im not sure where to put this, so i'll\
      \ put it here til told otherwise. I have Real Life data stores in autocad. i\
      \ would like to see the steps to turning this into editable unrealed terrain\
      \ if possible. so far i know: get dwg contours, import to 3d studio. create\
      \ terrain object. from there on out, i am unsure of how to get EDITABLE terrain.\
      \ i can export to ASE, then change to t3d, and get a brush. import ASE directly\
      \ and get a static mesh. none of these things is what i want, any ideas? i'll\
      \ give a sweet write-up if i ever figure it out</p>\n<p><b>WheatPuppet:</b>\
      \ I <i>think</i> your objective would be to, instead of making a 3d model, would\
      \ be to generate a grayscale heightmap. I don't know if that's possible in either\
      \ of those programs, but if you want it to actually be a terrain, you're going\
      \ to need a grayscale.</p>\n<p><b>Evilmrfrank:</b> Im having a problem. Ive\
      \ been able to complete making terrains in the past succesfully but for some\
      \ reason it will not allow me to use the smoothing tool and some of the others.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b> Maybe <a href=\"/Legacy:Terragen\" title=\"Legacy:Terragen\"\
      >Terragen</a> can import your model. I don't have the program on me right now\
      \ so I couldn't tell you, but you could check. Also, you can take a screenshot\
      \ of the model in windows, the PrintScreen captures an image of the current\
      \ screen, and puts it on the clipboard, where you can paste it into an image\
      \ document or something, clean it up, and then you've got yourself a heightmap.</p>\n\

  wikitext:
    text: "'''Terrain Mode''' is a [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]] mode new in [[Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ 3|UnrealEd 3]] which allows the mapper to manipulate terrain. It is a very\
      \ complex swiss army chainsaw (!) of a tool, which allows heightmaps and layer\
      \ maps to be imported as well as edited on the fly. This page is the reference\
      \ for Terrain Mode, if you want a tutorial see [[Legacy:Creating A Terrain|Creating\
      \ A Terrain]].\n\nTo enter this mode, click on the toolbox terrain mode icon\
      \ (the mountain with snowy peaks); this pops up the '''Terrain Editing window'''.\
      \ To close the window and leave this mode, pick another mode from the toolbox\
      \ such as the [[Legacy:Camera Movement|Camera Movement]] mode.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface-Ed3-TerrainTool.png|center|The\
      \ Terrain Editing window, with its icon highlighted]]\n\n==The Terrain Editing\
      \ window==\n\nThe '''Terrain Editing Window''' is a floating window, of fixed\
      \ size, with 2 top-level tabs on it:\n\n* Tools : Allows you to edit your terrain,\
      \ add layers etc. \n* Misc : commands to run the terrain generator.\n\nWe'll\
      \ mainly be concerned with '''Tools'''.\n\n==The Tools Tab==\n* In the upper\
      \ left is a list of the available tools. \n* In the upper middle and right are\
      \ options with apply to the tools. Check \"per tool?\" so each tool remembers\
      \ its own settings; otherwise they will apply to all the tools.\n* The lower\
      \ half of the window has another set of three tabs, which we'll call the '''Terrain\
      \ Layers tabs'''. This is where you select what the tools will act on &ndash;\
      \ the heightmap, the texture layers, or decoration layers.\n\n==The different\
      \ tools and the brush==\n\nAll the tools have the same basic interaction interface.\
      \ Pick a tool from the list by clicking on it. You mostly use them all in the\
      \ 3D [[Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport|UnrealEd viewport]], where the active \"brush\"\
      \ is represented by a yellow circle indicating the radius of effec. This yellow\
      \ circle follows the surface of the terrain, and indicates the inner & outer\
      \ radius settings. It's a good idea to set the viewport to \"wiremesh\" view\
      \ to see vertices more clearly, However, if you have already placed a sunlight\
      \ in your map, \"Dynamic\" or \"Lighting only\" make the terrain curvature easier\
      \ to see as well.\n\nIt is also possible to use some of them in an orthogonal\
      \ [[Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport|UnrealEd Viewport]] (the top view is most useful\
      \ for this). This can make setting terrain visibility easier, or painting layers,\
      \ or painting very specific parts of the heightmap. With the viewport in focus,\
      \ hit 'T' to show terrain: it will show textured and lit. It's a good idea to\
      \ enable the terrain grid visibility (in the layers tab, see below).  \n\nYou\
      \ use the '''control''' key in combination with either the left or right mouse\
      \ button to use a tool. In general, if '''control + left-mouse''' does one thing,\
      \ '''control + right-mouse''' does the opposite.\n\nThe tools are:\n\n; Vertex\
      \ Editing : see [[Legacy:Vertex Editing Terrain Tool|Vertex Editing Terrain\
      \ Tool]]\n; Select : allows you to select a rectangle, presumably to use the\
      \ \"generate\" tool on a region instead of the whole terrain\n; Painting : This\
      \ behaves differently according to whether the Heightmap or a layer is selected\
      \ in the lower three tabs. More: [[Legacy:Painting Terrain Tool|Painting Terrain\
      \ Tool]]\n;; Heightmap : raise (LMB) or lower (RMB) the terrain by an amount\
      \ determined by strength and adjust. The mouse must be moved to effect a change.\
      \ Set the strength and adjust to quite low with this tool, or large changes\
      \ will result very quickly.\n;; Layer : Mask or un-mask the layer.\n; Smoothing\
      \ : This will cause the terrain inside your editing circle to blend together\
      \ and become, well, smoother. This can be looked at as a sort of \"averaging\"\
      \ tool, where everything in the area is averaged together towards a middle height.\
      \ For instance, if you pumped up the radius to much larger than your terrain\
      \ area with strength of 100%, holding down the LMB would cause you to get, eventually,\
      \ a flat piece of terrain with the average elevation that all of your terrain\
      \ had. '''NOTE''': Smoothing off the edge of the terrain is BAD, resulting in\
      \ an instant UnrealEd crash or vertices suddenly pushed all the way to the minimum\
      \ terrain height. Save often. Also, the smoothing tool seems to act more quickly\
      \ on the terrain then other tools. You may want to turn the strength to about\
      \ 1/4 or 1/2 of what you originally intended.\n; Noise : introduces random changes,\
      \ raising the terrain in random places by an amount determined from the strength\
      \ and adjust. Useful for roughing up flat areas to make them look more natural.\n\
      ; Flatten : Ctrl + LMB on a terrain vertex, then wherever you drag the mouse\
      \ will be set to the height of that initial vertex. Useful for creating 'man-made'\
      \ areas in the terrain e.g. roads. Note that this mode is unlike the others\
      \ in that it does not modify the surface gradually, but makes an instantanious\
      \ change. Use with caution.\n; Visibility : This tool is used to show or hide\
      \ individual polygons and regions of the terrain.  What you can't see, you can't\
      \ touch, so use this tool to make e.g. entrances to caves that allow the player\
      \ to pass through the terrain. Obviously, you will just drop through any hole\
      \ to the bottom of the containing subtracted brush, so you need to add [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]]\
      \ geometry around the hole then subtract a cave, or put a [[Legacy:Static Mesh|static\
      \ mesh]] there.  The tricky bit is aligning the subterranean part seamlessly\
      \ with the terrain.  See DM-Antalus for a good example.\n; Edge Turn : This\
      \ tool rotates the tesselation of a certain face. In wireframe view you can\
      \ see that a terrain map is made up of tesselated squares, but all the tesselation\
      \ goes the same way. If you have sharp edges on your terrain because of extreme\
      \ changes in altitude, use the edge turn tool to switch the verticies that the\
      \ tesselation uses.\n; Tex Pan : Slides the texture of a layer around. I suppose\
      \ this would be important if you've got a custom texture for the terrain map,\
      \ otherwise, this has limited use. One good use of this is on [[Legacy:Terrain\
      \ Texture Layer|Terrain Texture layer]]s where the texture is projected sideways\
      \ onto the terrain, such as for layered rock. Panning allows you to change the\
      \ elevation of the layers.\n; Tex Rotate : Rotates the texture of a layer, again,\
      \ limited use.\n; Tex Scale : Scales the texture of a layer. You can do this\
      \ more mathematically by opening up the terraininfo's properties and flipping\
      \ through the layers and changing their scaling properties.\n\nMost terrain\
      \ editing is done using Painting, Smoothing, Flatten, and occasionally Visibility.\
      \ The others are useful for very fine control. \n\n==The Tool Options==\n\n\
      The tools options section changed the settings for the yellow brush you see\
      \ in the 3D window: its size, and how much it affects the terrain. It is ''very\
      \ important'', so get used to it, you'll tweak it often :). It consists of several\
      \ options:\n\n; Per Tool? : Off means all tools use the same radii, strenth,\
      \ and adjust values. On allows each tool to have separate settings.\n\n; Inner\
      \ Radius & Outer Radius : The outer radius is the size of the area of effect.\
      \ Some tools, like visibility and flatten, only use the outer radius. They have\
      \ their full effect anywhere they touch. Other tools, such as raising and lowering\
      \ terrain, use the inner radius also. These tools have maximum effect inside\
      \ the inner radius, then drop off to 0 change at the edge of the outer radius.\
      \ Setting the inner and outer radius the same will cause these tools to have\
      \ maximum effect for the whole circle. Setting the inner radius to zero will\
      \ cause a smooth blend from maximum at the center to nothing at the edge. Most\
      \ of the time, people have a small inner radius and a large outer radius.\n\n\
      ;; Lock icon : Tie the Inner Radius & Outer Radius sliders together, so that\
      \ they increase and decrease together. Useful for having a uniform 'blend edge'\
      \ while you change the size of the brush.\n\n; Strength & Adjust : These are\
      \ sort of like opacity and pressure in Photoshop &ndash; they control how much\
      \ the brush does, and how fast it does it. Larger values for Adjust and Strength\
      \ will cause modifications to your terrain to happen much faster &ndash; often\
      \ too fast, especially with the smoothing tool.\n\n; Ignore Invisible Quads\
      \ : Unknown effect. Perhaps broken?\n\n; Mirror : lets you work on 2 or 4 parts\
      \ of your terrain simultaneously. Great for outdoor CTF or ONS maps.\n\nIt's\
      \ pretty intuitive once you've done it a couple of times. When you can see the\
      \ effect of different settings immediately on how fast that hill rises, and\
      \ what its shape is, it becomes quite obvious! Experiment a lot &ndash; experimentation\
      \ is rewarded. Recommended settings will be given when treating the individual\
      \ tools, but for an example, here's the settings that I typically use for the\
      \ Smoothing tool:\n\n:'''Inner Radius''': 0\n:'''Outer Radius''': 1024 or larger\
      \ (sometimes as high as 8192)\n:'''Strength''': 8%\n:'''Adjust''': 4\n\nIn summary:\n\
      * All terrain editing is done in the 3D view (use the wiremesh viewmode to see\
      \ terrain vertices more clearly).\n* The brush is a bright yellow circlet\n\
      * Use the '''control''' key in combination with holding down the left or right\
      \ mouse buttons to use a tool. \n* Strength & Adjust are critical, and usually\
      \ best kept very low for fine editing\n* Experiment, experiment, experiment!\n\
      \n==Terrain Layers tabs ==\n\nSelect here which component of the terrain is\
      \ affected by the tool you use.\n\n===Terrains===\n\nLists all terrains currently\
      \ in your map, listed by the name of their heightmap texture (so if you change\
      \ these, beware!). Select the one to you want to work with from the list. Double-clicking\
      \ on the name in the list brings up the [[Legacy:Actor Properties|Actor Properties]]\
      \ for that terrain's [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]].\n\nClick the '''New\
      \ icon''' to make a new terrain. The terrain will be centered on the 3D [[Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Viewport|UnrealEd Viewport]] camera (we think!). The zone you are in needs\
      \ to be set to have bTerrainZone = True. See [[Legacy:Creating A Terrain|Creating\

      \ the Painting Tool alter that layer's  visibility on the terrain. (if nothing\
      \ seems to happen, remember the display order of the layers: the top layer in\
      \ the list is the one rendered first, so lowest.)\n\nUse the arrows to the right\
      \ to change layer order. This can be useful to bring the layer you are working\
      \ with to the top temporarily. (Here, 'top' means bottom... the first layer\
      \ in the list is the first to be rendered, so at the it's the one that is beneath\
      \ all the others on the terrain.)\n\nUse the grid button to toggle the terrain\
      \ grid display on some or all layers. \n\n===Decorations===\n\nCreate and edit\
      \ [[Legacy:Terrain Decoration Layer|Terrain Decoration layer]]s.\n\n==Misc tab==\n\
      \nThe misc tab holds the settings for the '''terrain generator'''. This generates\
      \ random terrain within the region currently highlighted with the [[Legacy:Select\
      \ Terrain Tool|Select Terrain Tool]]. \n\nCan't think of how you want your terrain\
      \ to look? Want UnrealEd to give you something more interesting to start with?\
      \ Use the '''terrain generator'''.\n\n; Steps: Controls how many passes the\
      \ generator makes over the terrain. More steps mean more hills.\n; Strength\
      \ : Controls the magnitude of the hills being generated. Max value 255. High\
      \ values mean steep, craggy peaks that leave almost no place to walk, and low\
      \ values mean gentle rolling hills that are pretty flat overall.\n; Use entire\
      \ Heightmap? : Tick this to have the generated surface use all of the terrain\
      \ space. Unticked, only uses what is currently selected with the Select tool\
      \ in the terrain editor.\n\n==Troubleshooting==\n; I can't adjust the terrain!\
      \  LMB + RMB + Ctrl = nothing happens : The file format of the terrain heightmap\
      \ is very important.  If it's not G16, then you won't be able to edit it properly\
      \ (if at all) with the tools. If importing your own heightmap, make sure it's\
      \ 8-bit grayscale, import it, then right-click it on the 'terrain info' tab\
      \ and convert it to G16.\n\n==External Links==\n\n===UDN===\n* [[udn2:TerrainTutorial]]\n\

      \  Then you can fill this page in yourself :)  And make it easier to follow.\n\
      \n'''Icedude:'''We realy need a tutoral on Deco Layers. I cant figure them out!\n\
      \n'''Tahngarth:''' could we integrate this with [[Legacy:Using The Terrain Tool|Using\
      \ The Terrain Tool]] somehow? This part seems more a description of the tools\
      \ than a step-by-step tutorial. Part I is quite important and well done tutorial,\
      \ but this part seems just a tool function summary. I'm not sure what to do\
      \ here, but theres bound to be some duplication going on if i finish writing\
      \ that page now.\n\n'''ProjectX:''' Ok, i've dun terrain before, and mastered\
      \ it, I have a cavern set up with two terrain actors, one above the other, they\
      \ used to be using the same heightmap, but i changed it. Now, i place playerstarts,\
      \ and rebuild, they come up with \"this player start is not on an even base\
      \ or neer a steep slope\", i finally got that to stop and i tested the game\
      \ and it said it couldnt find the player starts. I had 17 on there and i had\
      \ rebuilt the level without a single error. I tried loading the map up again\
      \ and it GPFd \n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' What type of rebuilding did you use? If\
      \ you did geometry, use the path rebuild button. If you did paths, use the geometry\
      \ rebuild button, and then use the path button. That happened to me once.\n\n\
      '''MadNad:''' Another interesting thing to note that I found was that by increasing\
      \ the size of your heightmap when creating terrain layer from 128x128 to 256x256\
      \ makes some pretty crisp shadowing, along with longer compiles and lower frames,\
      \ but still, very cool feature.\n\n'''Tesseract:''' Im not sure where to put\
      \ this, so i'll put it here til told otherwise.  I have Real Life data stores\
      \ in autocad. i would like to see the steps to turning this into editable unrealed\
      \ terrain if possible.  so far i know: get dwg contours, import to 3d studio.\
      \ create terrain object. from there on out, i am unsure of how to get EDITABLE\
      \ terrain. i can export to ASE, then change to t3d, and get a brush. import\
      \ ASE directly and get a static mesh. none of these things is what i want, any\
      \ ideas? i'll give a sweet write-up if i ever figure it out\n\n'''WheatPuppet:'''\
      \ I ''think'' your objective would be to, instead of making a 3d model, would\
      \ be to generate a grayscale heightmap. I don't know if that's possible in either\
      \ of those programs, but if you want it to actually be a terrain, you're going\
      \ to need a grayscale.\n\n'''Evilmrfrank:''' Im having a problem.  Ive been\
      \ able to complete making terrains in the past succesfully but for some reason\
      \ it will not allow me to use the smoothing tool and some of the others.\n\n\
      '''Bob_The_Beheader:''' Maybe [[Legacy:Terragen|Terragen]] can import your model.\
      \ I don't have the program on me right now so I couldn't tell you, but you could\
      \ check. Also, you can take a screenshot of the model in windows, the PrintScreen\
      \ captures an image of the current screen, and puts it on the clipboard, where\
      \ you can paste it into an image document or something, clean it up, and then\
      \ you've got yourself a heightmap.\n\n----\n\n[[:Category:Legacy Mapping]]<br\
