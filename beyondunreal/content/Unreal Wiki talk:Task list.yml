      \ according to that somewhat. Its not exactly on the standard layout though,\

      \ one tutorials would be. Like for eg making a mutator class would be a basic\
      \ thing and hello world mutator would expand on that basic procedure. Im also\
      \ not sure what to bring over myself, its obvious class pages will make their\
      \ way over with the new wikifier but for other pages I had alittle input with\
      \ Im not even sure who the original creator was anyways. Perhaps basic procedure\
      \ could be listed on this task list as well if its still the way things are\

      \ (i.e., \"The old Wiki was a mess\"). 1) \"Lengthy discussions could be found\
      \ on the majority of sites pages\"&#160;: Our discussions have now been relocated\
      \ to a special Discussion tab for each page; nice and neat. 2) \"detailed problems\
      \ that had been abandonned while still being unanswered\"&#160;: (not sure if\
      \ there is anything to do except) ask all wiki users/contributors to be vigilant\
      \ in responding to questions asked on various pages. (?) 3) \"The general layout\
      \ of pages often changed from author to author and so it was sometimes difficult\
      \ to find what you were looking for.\"&#160;: (not sure if you mean to say that\
      \ individual page format varied, or the structures of different sections of\
      \ the wiki varied in organization format) Either way, the solution is again\
      \ to ask wiki users to be vigilant in conforming to a set organizational structure\
      \ on pages and in groups of pages. *And this is of course why* I'm turning these\
      \ loose complaints into something actionable, so that an organizational structure\
      \ can be developed. 4) \"The old wiki had a lot of 'junk' - pages that were\
      \ just a waste of space and had no clear reason for its existance.\"&#160;:\
      \ Perhaps then this is an extra step; to evaluate new pages as they are created,\
      \ and judge them for usefulness and content. This list of things I extracted\
      \ from the previous paragraph boils down to: (discussion already moved), ask\
      \ wiki users to be vigilant, perhaps judge content as its created, ... and that's\
      \ all. This is *not* an organization plan! Does all this make sense? Avoid rantish\
      \ complaints and come up with some organizational plan any wiki user can clearly\
      \ follow. So far, I've been watching what's going on here and I remain wholly\
      \ unconvinced that any such plan exists, and further, I doubt a comprehensive\
      \ organizational plan will emerge in the near future. I don't want to see the\

      ::::::: I'll try to post some more thoughts soon; I've been rather busy.  I'm\
      \ not of the opinion that the old structure needs to be abandoned entirely,\
      \ so I think the first step would be to lay out exactly what the old structure\
      \ was in a reasonable format. – [[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 15:40, 25 April 2008 (UTC)\n\
      \n::::::: Yeah Ive seen that page myself but it doesnt actually provide any\
      \ basic layouts its just guidelines for writing structure on the most part,\
      \ which is certainly helpful. What I would be looking for myself is a set of\
      \ templates which cover basic outlining of different types of pages for consistency.\
      \ I guess that page itself has a nice structure to it, perhaps thats what I\
      \ should be aiming for when I make a page. There is however no blue headings\
      \ on that page which seems to create more entries to the contents, Im not sure\
      \ if anyone agree's but perhaps we could cull that green headings only, there\
      \ is another bold heading though, maybe its a bad idea. -[[User:OlympusMons|OlympusMons]]\
