      </dl>\n<p>'<i>[DoW]MeepZero:</i> I noticed that the light effect properties\
      \ when rebuilt come up with an obsolete light effect error in my verson of Ued\
      \ (UT2k4 v3355). Im guessing this is what you were talking about with them not\
      \ being functional anymore up top there. The light type properties only function\
      \ if the light is set as a dynamic light. Is there any way to get those lighteffects\
      \ to work, or can they be simulated in some way?</p>\n<p><b>UArch</b> i noticed\
      \ the description for nonincidence was incorrect, it does not pass through walls...its\
      \ basically the same as le_none but it doesnt take the surface normals into\
      \ account when lighting bsp</p>\n<p><b>Tester</b> I think Spotlight is a dynamic\
      \ light, whereas StaticSpot isn't. I did a quick search over the net to find\
      \ out what LE_Negative is. That light effect seems to be a negative light, instead\
      \ of casting light it \"subtracts\" light.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> The \"dynamicness\"\
      \ of a light depends exclusively on the value of bDynamicLight. There's absolutely\
      \ no difference between SpotLight and StaticSpot, at least not in UT2004.</p>\n\
      <p><b>seditious:</b> I noticed the Postal Babes mutator made color-cycling dynamic\
      \ lights so I looked into the code... it's simply changing the value of LightHue\
      \ each Tick(). Based on that (directly on, hopefully with L7's permission),\
      \ I'm thinking about brute-forcing the LightType effects into a subclass of\
      \ Light. The obvious problems so far include not being able to get palettes\
      \ from textures without some fancy code and probably not at all, and of course\
      \ the performance. I had already subclassed LinkBeamEffect to make it stay put\
      \ like a decoration even in network games, just by overriding the default properties.\
      \ When I pasted L7's dynamic light code into the otherwise empty script, the\
      \ green muzzle glow on nearby walls and floor was changing colors, woohoo! So\
      \ I have only to create a set of patterns and give them enum names or something,\
      \ and maybe create a few more variables for brightness, phase, frequency, amplitude,\
      \ etc... but since these pages suggest certain effects already work with the\
      \ right properties, is this a waste of time? I'm still a total n00b&#160;:)\
      \ Gonna go play with bStatic for a few. ADDED: OK, it's that simple. I subclassed\
      \ Light, only making the default property bStatic=false and now the LightTypes\
      \ (LT_*) work as promised. Well, also bDynamicLight has to be true so I'm going\
      \ to add that to the defaults... Anyway I'll probably still do this just for\
      \ the sake of total flexibility (maybe even radius!). And no matter what I did,\
      \ LightEffects (LE_*) didn't animate. No big deal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"\

      \ i can tell.\n; LE_Shock : Like LT_Strobe, only faster.\n; LE_Disco : Random\
      \ \"disco\" lights, the type of lighting you see in n00b maps.\n; LE_Warp :\
      \ ??? No apparent effects.\n; LE_Spotlight : One spot of light. Remember to\
      \ rotate the light actor to get this where you want it.\n; LE_NonIncidence :\
      \ same as le_none but does not take surface normals into account, generally\
      \ makes light look brighter, useful for lighting curved bsp surfaces as the\
      \ surface normals wont create a flatshaded look\n; LE_Shell : Gives a \"The\
      \ Ring\" effect, only lights up the edge of the radius.\n; LE_OmnibumpMap :\
      \ Yikes. No apparent effects.\n; LE_Interference : Like SlowWave/FastWave mixed\
      \ together, except differs according to the textures.\n; LE_Cylinder : It's\
      \ a cylinder of light instead of a sphere.\n; LE_Rotor : As if a fan was in\
      \ the way between the light and the surface. - the effect is a little wrong\
      \ actually :P but it does an ok job, most people dont notice :P.\n; LE_Sunlight\
      \ : Used in the sunlight class. From what I can tell its a huge directional\
      \ cylinder.\n; LE_QuadraticNonIncidence : \n\n'''2k4'''\n; LE_Negative :\n\n\

      \ \n\n==LightEffects in UT2004==\n\ndjdanlib &rarr; I will register at some\
      \ point... This is what LightEffects do in UT2004's UnrealEd. Only a few are\
      \ non-working. However, the current version of the engine doesn't allow these\
      \ to animate in-game unless the Light is Non-Static. They do at least project\
      \ static light patterns. Setting a light as dynamic effectively disables the\
      \ light.\n\n; LE_None : Normal, obviously\n; LE_TorchWaver : Obsolete\n; LE_FireWaver\
      \ : Obsolete\n; LE_WateryShimmer : Obsolete\n; LE_Searchlight : Supported\n\
      ; LE_SlowWave : Supported\n; LE_FastWave : Supported\n; LE_CloudCast : Obsolete\n\

      \ I noticed that the light effect properties when rebuilt come up with an obsolete\
      \ light effect error in my verson of Ued (UT2k4 v3355).  Im guessing this is\
      \ what you were talking about with them not being functional anymore up top\
      \ there.  The light type properties only function if the light is set as a dynamic\
      \ light.  Is there any way to get those lighteffects to work, or can they be\
      \ simulated in some way?\n\n'''UArch''' i noticed the description for nonincidence\
      \ was incorrect, it does not pass through walls...its basically the same as\
      \ le_none but it doesnt take the surface normals into account when lighting\
      \ bsp\n\n'''Tester''' I think Spotlight is a dynamic light, whereas StaticSpot\
      \ isn't. I did a quick search over the net to find out what LE_Negative is.\
      \ That light effect seems to be a negative light, instead of casting light it\
      \ \"subtracts\" light.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' The \"dynamicness\" of a light depends\
      \ exclusively on the value of bDynamicLight. There's absolutely no difference\
      \ between SpotLight and StaticSpot, at least not in UT2004.\n\n'''seditious:'''\
      \ I noticed the Postal Babes mutator made color-cycling dynamic lights so I\
      \ looked into the code... it's simply changing the value of LightHue each Tick().\
      \ Based on that (directly on, hopefully with L7's permission), I'm thinking\
      \ about brute-forcing the LightType effects into a subclass of Light. The obvious\
      \ problems so far include not being able to get palettes from textures without\
      \ some fancy code and probably not at all, and of course the performance. I\
      \ had already subclassed LinkBeamEffect to make it stay put like a decoration\
      \ even in network games, just by overriding the default properties. When I pasted\
      \ L7's dynamic light code into the otherwise empty script, the green muzzle\
      \ glow on nearby walls and floor was changing colors, woohoo! So I have only\
      \ to create a set of patterns and give them enum names or something, and maybe\
      \ create a few more variables for brightness, phase, frequency, amplitude, etc...\
      \ but since these pages suggest certain effects already work with the right\
      \ properties, is this a waste of time? I'm still a total n00b :) Gonna go play\
      \ with bStatic for a few. ADDED: OK, it's that simple. I subclassed Light, only\
      \ making the default property bStatic=false and now the LightTypes (LT_*) work\
      \ as promised. Well, also bDynamicLight has to be true so I'm going to add that\
      \ to the defaults... Anyway I'll probably still do this just for the sake of\
      \ total flexibility (maybe even radius!). And no matter what I did, LightEffects\
      \ (LE_*) didn't animate. No big deal.\n\n----\n\n[[:Category:Legacy To Do]]\
