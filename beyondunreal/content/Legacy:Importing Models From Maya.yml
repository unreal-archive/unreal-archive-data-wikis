      \ model into Ued as a <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static\
      \ Mesh\">static mesh</a> from Maya PLE. This is not a polygonal modeling in\
      \ Maya tutorial. However, it does outline the important aspects of a Maya model\
      \ ready for export to Ued.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Your_Model\"\

      <ol>\n<li>Should be \"facing positive X\". Meaning, in Maya, the model's front\
      \ side should be toward the positive end of the X-axis. This will ensure a proper\
      \ orientation in Ued.</li>\n<li>Should be near the origin. Meaning, in Maya,\
      \ the model's center should be on or near Maya's world origin, where all axis\
      \ converge at zero.</li>\n<li>Should have its Center pivot placed in a reasonable\
      \ place. For example, a wheel would likely need the center pivot in the middle,\
      \ while an hammer may need the center to be along the handle somewhere. It depends\
      \ on if this is meant to be used as a mover, how it should move, or how it should\
      \ be normally placed as a static mesh object in UnrealEd.</li>\n<li>Should be\
      \ one single object, not multiple objects placed together (unless you want them\
      \ to be separate in UnrealEd). Use Polygon -&gt; Combine. Merge any extraneous\
      \ faces, edges and vertices.</li>\n<li>Should have the normals facing the correct\
      \ direction. Use Display -&gt; PolygonComponents -&gt; Normals to see which\
      \ direction your polygonal faces are \"facing\".</li>\n<li>Should have different\
      \ materials (shaders) applied to the polygonal faces that are meant to have\
      \ different materials textures applied in UnrealEd. For example, you are making\
      \ a car. You chassis has a texture all its own, but you want to use a simple\
      \ glass material for the windshield. In this case, in Maya, you'd apply one\
      \ color (material, shader) to the chassis and another color for the windshield.\
      \ It doesn't matter what color, it's just an indicator to UnrealEd that these\
      \ are separate materials that you'll apply in UnrealEd.</li>\n<li>Should have\
      \ its polygon texture alignment ready to go. Use the tools found in EditPolygons\
      \ -&gt; Texture -&gt; ... to apply various projection schemes (like cylindrical,\
      \ planar or automatic) and adjust the scale and orientation of those projections,\
      \ if applicable.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exporting_from_Maya_to_Ued\"\

      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> Please don't try to link to Maya tools or properties described\
      \ in this tutorial. Some terminology conflicts with Unreal terminology. That\
      \ will only serve to confuse the Ued mapper.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Good point,\
      \ I wasn't sure about linking Pivot. But surely <a href=\"/Legacy:MyLevel\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:MyLevel\">MyLevel</a> is the same everywhere? I linked the\
      \ tools to suggest we might want to make pages for these.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ Yes, <a href=\"/Legacy:MyLevel\" title=\"Legacy:MyLevel\">myLevel</a> is strictly\
      \ an Unreal convention, but in this case, it would be easily confused with a\
      \ simple name selection (along with myModel &amp; myGroup), not the virutal\
      \ package that it is. That's why I explicitly note to see that page and read\
      \ the warnings involved in its usage. The Maya tools, windows, etc. really don't\
      \ belong on this Unreal Wiki site, IMHO. I have a lot of experience with Maya,\
      \ so I can tell you with certanty, if you began to fill this wiki with Maya\
      \ info, it would eventually overtake the amount of Unreal info. Maya is an incredibly\
      \ deep animation app and a simple link to other well-established Maya sites\
      \ should suffice. There are many sites out there to help those new to Maya and\
      \ they've been doing it for years. I think they'd do a much better job than\
      \ anything made here, frankly.</p>\n<p><b>Tgusagalpa:</b> No offense, but 3DBuzz\
      \ never explained how to get a .psk, so, could someone tell me how to get one,\
      \ because I have a mesh in MayaPLE that is seriously wanting to b a .psk!</p>\n\
      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> To get .psk (and .psa for animated meshes), you'll need\
      \ to use <a href=\"/Legacy:ActorX\" title=\"Legacy:ActorX\">ActorX</a> instead.\
      \ Note, there is no ActorX plug-in for MayaPLE versions, only for retail versions\
      \ of Maya.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.054 seconds\n\

      \ the normals facing the correct direction. Use Display -> PolygonComponents\
      \ -> Normals to see which direction your polygonal faces are \"facing\".\n#Should\
      \ have different materials (shaders) applied to the polygonal faces that are\
      \ meant to have different materials textures applied in UnrealEd.  For example,\
      \ you are making a car.  You chassis has a texture all its own, but you want\
      \ to use a simple glass material for the windshield. In this case, in Maya,\
      \ you'd apply one color (material, shader) to the chassis and another color\
      \ for the windshield. It doesn't matter what color, it's just an indicator to\
      \ UnrealEd that these are separate materials that you'll apply in UnrealEd.\n\
      #Should have its polygon texture alignment ready to go.  Use the tools found\
      \ in EditPolygons -> Texture -> ... to apply various projection schemes (like\
      \ cylindrical, planar or automatic) and adjust the scale and orientation of\
      \ those projections, if applicable.\n\n===Exporting from Maya to Ued===\n#Select\
      \ your model object. <br />[[Image:Legacy_MayaImportTut0.jpeg|]]\n#If your UnEditor.mll\
      \ Maya plugin is installed and enabled, you should have a button tab available\
      \ called, \"UnrealEdExport\".  Click on that and click on the \"Static Mesh\
      \ Export Window\" button.  If not already open, this will automatically launch\
      \ Ued and put it in the background. <br />[[Image:Legacy_MayaImportTut1.jpeg|]]\n\
      #The Static Mesh UT2Kx Export Window will pop up.  There are spaces to enter\
      \ a package name, group name and model name.  If you've selected your model,\
      \ the model name will default to the name as it appears in Maya. <br />[[Image:Legacy_MayaImportTut2.jpeg|]]\n\
      #Select a Unreal package to export to, if you've already created one (and skip\
      \ the next step).  If you haven't, select \"Create New Package\".<br />[[Image:Legacy_MayaImportTut3.jpeg|]]\n\
      #A small window will pop up to give you a chance to name the new package.  For\
      \ example, to import your model as an embedded resource, enter \"myLevel\".\
      \ (please read the warnings about using the [[Legacy:MyLevel|myLevel]] package.)\
      \ <br />[[Image:Legacy_MayaImportTut4.jpeg|]]\n#Enter a group name.  This is\
      \ optional. <br />[[Image:Legacy_MayaImportTut5.jpeg|]]\n#Enter a static mesh\
      \ name, unless you want to keep it the same name. <br />[[Image:Legacy_MayaImportTut6.jpeg|]]\n\
      #You can choose to import the model based on the Relative position in Maya space,\
      \ or based rigidly on the World space.  This refers to the position of the object's\
      \ center in Maya and its location in Maya space with relation to the origin.\n\
      #Hit the Export button.\n#You should see a confirmation that, \"Result: Export\
      \ complete.\"\n\n===In UnrealEd===\n#Open the [[Legacy:Static Mesh Browser|Static\
      \ Mesh Browser]].\n#Find your package. Select myLevel if you chose to embed\
      \ the resource. \n#You should see your static mesh model, now imported. \n#Assign\
      \ the materials you'd like to use.  You'll find there will be one [[Legacy:Material|Material]]\
      \ slot available for every material shader you assigned to the polygons of this\
      \ model in Maya.  In our car example, there would be two material slots: one\
      \ for the chassis and one for the windshield.  In this case, you'd simply assign\
      \ your chassis texture to one slot and a simple glass material to the other.\n\
      #Don't forget to save either your [[Legacy:Package|package]] file or your map,\
      \ if the static mesh you imported is embedded in MyLevel.\n\n===Wrap up===\n\
      \nThat's it.  From here you'll no doubt see things you'll want to change or\
      \ alter.  Perhaps you found a polygon facing the wrong way and you need to reverse\
      \ that normal, perhaps you'd like to assign more shaders to different polygons\
      \ to make more material slots, perhaps you need to adjust the texture projections.\n\
      \n==Tips==\n* Sometimes it's a good idea to delete the modeling History ''(using\
      \ the Delete by Type selection under the Edit menu)'' on your object after the\
      \ model is built, but before you begin to apply texture projections and shader\
      \ assignments.  This is not necessary, but it helps to keep things cleaner and\
      \ easy to find the aspects of your model that will need tweaking after the initial\
      \ import.\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://www.tutorialized.com/tutorials/Maya/1\

      \n'''SuperApe:''' Please don't try to link to Maya tools or properties described\
      \ in this tutorial.  Some terminology conflicts with Unreal terminology.  That\
      \ will only serve to confuse the Ued mapper.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Good point, I\
      \ wasn't sure about linking Pivot. But surely [[Legacy:MyLevel|MyLevel]] is\
      \ the same everywhere? I linked the tools to suggest we might want to make pages\
      \ for these.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Yes, [[Legacy:MyLevel|myLevel]] is strictly\
      \ an Unreal convention, but in this case, it would be easily confused with a\
      \ simple name selection (along with myModel & myGroup), not the virutal package\
      \ that it is.  That's why I explicitly note to see that page and read the warnings\
      \ involved in its usage.  The Maya tools, windows, etc. really don't belong\
      \ on this Unreal Wiki site, IMHO.  I have a lot of experience with Maya, so\
      \ I can tell you with certanty, if you began to fill this wiki with Maya info,\
      \ it would eventually overtake the amount of Unreal info.  Maya is an incredibly\
      \ deep animation app and a simple link to other well-established Maya sites\
      \ should suffice.  There are many sites out there to help those new to Maya\
      \ and they've been doing it for years.  I think they'd do a much better job\
      \ than anything made here, frankly.\n\n'''Tgusagalpa:''' No offense, but 3DBuzz\
      \ never explained how to get a .psk, so, could someone tell me how to get one,\
      \ because I have a mesh in MayaPLE that is seriously wanting to b a .psk!\n\n\
      '''SuperApe:''' To get .psk (and .psa for animated meshes), you'll need to use\
      \ [[Legacy:ActorX|ActorX]] instead.  Note, there is no ActorX plug-in for MayaPLE\
      \ versions, only for retail versions of Maya.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Tutorial|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
