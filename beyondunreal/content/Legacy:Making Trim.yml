      <p>(First of all, can someone explain *what is trim*?)</p>\n<p>The basic idea\
      \ is that if you want trim around the base of a room, flush with the wall:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>make a subtractive brush that is the same base width and length as\
      \ the room, and 32 high. Subtract this to create a change in texture on the\
      \ wall and make the room brush smaller too so they don't overlap.</li>\n<li>alternative\
      \ method: use clipping to split the room subtract 32 units above the floor.\
      \ (NB split, not clip – produce two brushes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This technique\
      \ is useful for walkways and ledges too: instead of subtracting a large room\
      \ &amp; adding in a ledge, subtract 3 brushes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>below the ledge</li>\n\
      <li>above the ledge</li>\n<li>and a ledge-thickness piece sandwiched in between</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>This gives you free trim all the way around the room, but there can\
      \ only be one direction for the texture. If your trim needs to be directional,\
      \ try seperate pieces by <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Trim_With_The_Extruder\" title=\"\
