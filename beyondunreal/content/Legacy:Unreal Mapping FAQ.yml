      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>General Crash Tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Save often. UnrealEd\
      \ is finicky and not the stablest environment. You can set up autosave by opening\
      \ the advanced options property editor in the view menu, and expanding the Editor\\\
      Advanced tab. The AutoSave and AutoSaveTime properties control level autosaving.</li>\n\
      <li>After UnrealEd crashes ensure you rebuild the level completely.</li>\n<li>It\
      \ has been suggested that quitting the editor before testing a level can add\
      \ to the stability of UnrealEd and UT2K3.</li>\n<li>Use autosave to save your\
      \ map periodically. Autosave information can be found here: <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Advanced_Options\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd Advanced Options\">UnrealEd Advanced Options</a>.</li>\n\
      <li>There's some known issues with UnrealEd and Windows 98/ME. The stability\
      \ of the program is reduced the longer you run it (<a href=\"/Legacy:Tarquin\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Tarquin\">tarquin</a> reports getting about 30 minutes out\
      \ of it at a time). Symptoms of this problem are \"critical errors\", \"runtime\
      \ errors\", or \"illegal operations\". The only way to fix this is to reboot\
      \ and keep trying.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dt>UnrealEd won't start, and instead\
      \ gives an error dialog about 'MSVCP60.dll' missing&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This is\
      \ a problem on any Windows pre-XP with UnrealEd on UT2004 v3270 and later. <a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=MSVCP60.DLL\"\

      \ text\" href=\"http://unreal.epicgames.com\">Unreal Technology</a> page. Patching\
      \ UT2003 to build 2136 also fixes this problem. (Don't apply the Windows 98/ME\
      \ patch after patching to build 2136.)</li>\n<li>If you see <tt>WM_BROWSER_DOCK</tt>\
      \ in the crash history, try going in Unrealed.ini and changing Docked=1 to Docked=0\
      \ under [Texture Browser], [Sound Browser], etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>UnrealEd crashes when I try and extract all of the UnrealScript sources.&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>That's a bug which is partly fixed with the UT2003 patch build 2136. But\
      \ classes exported that way are incomplete due to an exporter bug; better download\
      \ Epic's original sources from <a href=\"/Legacy:Class_Tree\" title=\"Legacy:Class\

      \ to build my map&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This happens occasionaly, sometimes it is\
      \ caused by something easily fixed and obviously wrong with BSP (like you made\
      \ a surface antiportal when you needed a zone portal). If this is not the case,\
      \ it can often be resolved by copying every actor and pasting it into a new\
      \ file. Note that unrealEd offsets everything when you paste it, so you might\
      \ want to correct this to keep everything on major gridlines. Also removing\
      \ lights is known to help.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>What if you change\

      <dd>This appears to be generally caused by the browsers being located off the\

      \ see. Press <b>ALT</b>-<b>SPACE</b>, then <b>M</b> to select the move option\

      \ version, click the icon in the top left of any window to see the menu and\
      \ the appropriate hotkey.) You can then use the keyboard arrows or the mouse\
      \ to move the window until you can see it. When I had this problem, the window\
      \ was located just off the right edge of the screen. Or, after clicking the\
      \ button to open the browser, right click the task bar and select 'Cascade Windows'\
      \ it will bring any off screen windows to fore.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>My map\

      \ also notice that the SetDynStreams in the Hardware section of the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Console_Commands/Stats_Console_Commands_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Console\
      \ Commands/Stats Console Commands (UT)\">STAT</a> console command is several\
      \ milliseconds. The solution is to either set bCollideActors property to false\

      \ are blank. they don't have icons. WTF?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This could be because\
      \ you have misplaced or deleted your editorres folder located within the System\

      <dd>You can use Autocad or Inventor to create meshes as long as as you save\

      \ save it as a ase file which you can then import into UED 3 as a static mesh\

      <dl>\n<dt>While making a skybox, the textures are smeared, and no manipulation\

      <p>This is caused by the textures you are using having their texture clamp mode\
      \ set to TC_Clamp, rather than TC_Wrap (which is the more usual setting – see\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:BitmapMaterial\" title=\"Legacy:BitmapMaterial\">BitmapMaterial</a>\
      \ for more information). Basically, this means that they can't tile on surfaces\
      \ larger than their dimensions. To fix this, the texture must be scaled to the\
      \ exact size of the surface, and it must be aligned exactly to its edges (so\
      \ for example if you have a cube of size 512, and a texture of 256, simply double\
      \ it in the texture aligment properties, then make sure the texture is all aligned\
      \ up properly). To do this, you can either experiment with the <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Pan\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Texture Pan\">Texture Pan</a> tool, or do the following:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>In the <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Properties_Window\" title=\"Legacy:Surface\
      \ Properties Window\">Surface Properties Window</a>, switch to the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Surface_Alignment\" title=\"Legacy:Surface Alignment\">Surface Alignment</a>\
      \ tab, select \"Face\", then type in the correct scaling so the texture will\
      \ fit the surface exactly (so if your brush is a 1024 cube, and the texture\
      \ is also 1024, leave the scaling at 1)</li>\n<li>Click \"Align\" to perform\
      \ the alignment</li>\n<li>Switch to the Pan/Rot/Scale tab.</li>\n<li>Press the\
      \ \"1\" button for each direction.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If that still doesn't fix\
      \ it, look at the <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP\" title=\"Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a> cuts\
      \ in Zone/Portal view. Clamping textures don't seem to cope well with cuts.\
      \ If this problem is in your skybox, the move it away from the rest of the map\
      \ to remove stray cuts.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>I've tried to create a\
      \ fluid object, i can see the surface from above the water, but when i go under\

      <p><b>StarWeaver</b>: Ok, I'm not sure if I'm bringing this up in the right\
      \ place, but this is where we're told that Bright Corners no longer exists in\
      \ 200x, and this also goes with this section on coming from UT99. There needs\
      \ to be something in here about working around the lack of bright textures.\
      \ I've been beating my head against this problem all day; I've got a ceiling\
      \ I'm trying to make out of a flattened arch shape from the 2d editor and it's\
      \ got dark banding in the lightmap between each face.</p>\n<p>I've searched\
      \ around the forums and the wiki and the possible solutions I've come up with\
      \ are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a static mesh instead (It's the Way of the Future.)\
      \ This is probably what I'll end up doing, but it makes it harder not only to\
      \ do dramatic lighting effects but to work with the texture selection / manipulation\
      \ in the editor, so I'll be waiting until I'm done with the texturing and layout.</li>\n\
      <li>Use dynamic lighting. I know this will work, because every time I modify\
      \ a lightsource in the editor the preview looks great before I rebuild the lighting,\
      \ but it also won't work right with shadows, and if you have any regular light\
      \ source shining on the surface it will get some of the shadow effect.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>And for the record, here's some things that DON'T help, at least in\
      \ my case:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any of the surface flags that we have in UT2004.</li>\n\
      <li>Changing the lightmap quality in any fashion.</li>\n<li>Creating the brush\
      \ as an addition vs a subtraction or as a 2d-shape-editor extrusion vs a modified\
      \ basic cylinder or as solid vs semisolid.</li>\n<li>Adding multiple lights\
      \ in different formations and at different distances or changing any of the\
      \ settings except bDynamicLight.</li>\n<li>Setting the PolyFlags on the brush\
      \ to 548622 or whatever used to correspond to Bright Corners in the older engines.</li>\n\
      <li>Transforming the brush to a static mesh dosn't work even for a temporary\
      \ fill-in while building with a 2048-long brush, because there just aren't enough\
      \ vertexes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This problem is really starting to bug me, since\
      \ it feels like the devs took out a feature designed to work around a bug or\
      \ issue with their lighting raytracer without actually fixing the raytracer,\
      \ and I'm really having a hard time comprehending why such a change was made.\
      \ In any event, I feel there should be a page or section on dealing with these\
      \ lighting glitches, but it could use more information than I can gather in\
      \ an afternoon.</p>\n<p><b>cancausecancer</b>: I wrote something for converting\
      \ UT maps to UT2004. I works fine but it still needs to create volumes and staticMeshes\
      \ and match textures/sounds better. It preserves lights*color, sounds (tries\
      \ to determine which sound is which), transporters, movers, pathing and pickups.\
      \ It's using a default staticMesh for movers until I can write something to\
      \ build a new staticMesh package. I'm looking for a list of which UT textures\
      \ match to UT2004 textures. So far I am only re-texturing using 20 textures\
      \ because guessing the textures is difficult, the best method I could come up\
      \ with was scanning the old texture names against a word list and putting a\
      \ weight on more exact names. Does anyone have a match up list by chance?</p>\n\

      \ UnrealEd 3. See [[Legacy:Unreal Mapping FAQ (UT)|Unreal Mapping FAQ (UT)]]\
      \ for the old [[Legacy:UnrealEd 2|UnrealEd 2]] FAQ.\n\n'''Got a question that\
      \ isn't covered here?''' Add it to the list (at its appropriate place) and leave\
      \ the answer out. Somebody else will fill it in. Alternatively check the [[Legacy:Help\

      ; Where do I get a map editor for <insert name of Unreal engine game>? : Usually\
      \ UnrealEd comes with the game. See [[Legacy:UnrealEd Versions|UnrealEd Versions]].\
      \ \n\n; Are there any map editors other than UnrealEd? : Nope, it's UnrealEd\
      \ or bust.\n\n; What are the recommended system requirements for UnrealEd? :\
      \ The editor generally has the same requirements as the game. Consider providing\
      \ more processor power and/or cores for optimal performance, though.\n\n; UnrealEd\
      \ isn't included in the demo! : That's right.  Buy the retail version to get\
      \ the editor.\n\n; What patches are there for the editor? : UnrealEd patches\
      \ are included in game updates. If you have the latest version of the game,\
      \ you automatically have the latest version of the editor as well.\n\n; Where\
      \ do I find tutorials for UnrealEd? : Take a look around this site! Try...\n\

      \nGeneral Crash Tips:\n* Save often.  UnrealEd is finicky and not the stablest\
      \ environment. You can set up autosave by opening the advanced options property\
      \ editor in the view menu, and expanding the Editor\\Advanced tab. The AutoSave\
      \ and AutoSaveTime properties control level autosaving.\n* After UnrealEd crashes\
      \ ensure you rebuild the level completely.\n* It has been suggested that quitting\
      \ the editor before testing a level can add to the stability of UnrealEd and\
      \ UT2K3.\n* Use autosave to save your map periodically.  Autosave information\
      \ can be found here:  [[Legacy:UnrealEd Advanced Options|UnrealEd Advanced Options]].\n\
      * There's some known issues with UnrealEd and Windows 98/ME.  The stability\
      \ of the program is reduced the longer you run it ([[Legacy:Tarquin|tarquin]]\
      \ reports getting about 30 minutes out of it at a time).  Symptoms of this problem\
      \ are \"critical errors\", \"runtime errors\", or \"illegal operations\".  The\
      \ only way to fix this is to reboot and keep trying.\n\n; UnrealEd won't start,\
      \ and instead gives an error dialog about 'MSVCP60.dll' missing : This is a\
      \ problem on any Windows pre-XP with UnrealEd on UT2004 v3270 and later. [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=MSVCP60.DLL\
      \ Google Search] for MSVCP60.dll. You can just shove the file in [[Legacy:Base\
      \ Directory|Base Directory]]\\System.\n\n; UnrealEd crashes when I try to start\
      \ it : \n;* on Windows 98/ME ? Download the [http://ut2003master.epicgames.com/other/ut2003_editor_win98_patch.zip\
      \ Windows 98/ME patch] from the official [http://unreal.epicgames.com Unreal\
      \ Technology] page. Patching UT2003 to build 2136 also fixes this problem. (Don't\
      \ apply the Windows 98/ME patch after patching to build 2136.)\n;* If you see\
      \ <tt>WM_BROWSER_DOCK</tt> in the crash history, try going in Unrealed.ini and\
      \ changing Docked=1 to Docked=0 under [Texture Browser], [Sound Browser], etc.\n\
      \n; UnrealEd crashes when I try and extract all of the UnrealScript sources.\
      \ : That's a bug which is partly fixed with the UT2003 patch build 2136. But\
      \ classes exported that way are incomplete due to an exporter bug; better download\
      \ Epic's original sources from [[Legacy:Class Tree|Class Tree]].\n\n; UnrealEd\
      \ crashes when I try to build my map : This happens occasionaly, sometimes it\
      \ is caused by something easily fixed and obviously wrong with BSP (like you\
      \ made a surface antiportal when you needed a zone portal). If this is not the\
      \ case, it can often be resolved by copying every actor and pasting it into\
      \ a new file. Note that unrealEd offsets everything when you paste it, so you\
      \ might want to correct this to keep everything on major gridlines. Also removing\
      \ lights is known to help.\n;* What if you change the build settings?\n\n;UnrealEd\
      \ crashes when I try to edit the visibility of terrain in the terrain editing\
      \ mode : This needs a response.\n\n===Rescue Operations===\n; Actor Properties\
      \ No Longer Open. F4, double click, or right click nothing opens actor properties\
      \ anymore :\n\n; First Aid : \nIf the latest version of the map you saved is\
      \ messed up, try the following:\n* If you had Autosave enabled, check your <code>Maps</code>\
      \ folder for maps whose names start with <code>Auto...</code>. \n* If you playtested\
      \ your map from within UnrealEd recently, that version of your map is called\
      \ <code>Autoplay</code> in your <code>Maps</code> folder.\n\nLook at the folder\
      \ in Details mode and sort by last modified date, that will put the last save\
      \ right at the top and easy to find.\n\n\n; I can't select any [[Legacy:Surface|surface]]s\
      \ (textures in the 3D view) and the right mouse click doesn't do anything :\
      \ Try...\n;# turning off anti-aliasing. \n;# turning off anisotropic filtering.\n\
      ;# pressing '''S'''. (this toggles visibility of the selection highlight: see\
      \ [[Legacy:Viewport Caption Context Menu|Viewport Caption Context Menu]] for\
      \ more.)\n\n; All the viewports are white when I start UnrealEd.  How do I get\
      \ them back? : That's an old bug. Do [[Legacy:UnrealEd Main Menu|UnrealEd Main\
      \ Menu]] -> ''View'' -> ''Viewports'' -> ''Configure'' -> ''OK'' to fix it.\n\
      \n; UnrealEd shows up with a \"window creation error\" when I start it. What's\
      \ wrong? : You have to restart your computer because system resources are too\
      \ low (below 50%). To see how much system resources you have, right-click on\
      \ My Computer and select Properties. On the performance tab, it will say how\
      \ many system resources you have.\n\n; None of the [[Legacy:Resource Browser|resource\
      \ browser]]s ([[Legacy:Actor Browser|actor browser]], etc.) are accessible.\
      \ : This appears to be generally caused by the browsers being located off the\
      \ screen. To get them back onto the visible portion of the screen, open one\
      \ of the browsers. The window focus will change to the window that you cannot\
      \ see. Press <B>ALT</B>-<B>SPACE</B>, then <B>M</B> to select the move option\
      \ from the mini menu that's a part of every window. (If you are using a non-english\
      \ version, click the icon in the top left of any window to see the menu and\
      \ the appropriate hotkey.) You can then use the keyboard arrows or the mouse\
      \ to move the window until you can see it. When I had this problem, the window\
      \ was located just off the right edge of the screen. Or, after clicking the\
      \ button to open the browser, right click the task bar and select 'Cascade Windows'\
      \ it will bring any off screen windows to fore.\n\n; My map suddenly takes a\
      \ lot of time to load/light and moving this static mesh takes several minutes!\
      \ : Normally this happens after you add a large (in dimensions or over ~20,000\
      \ triangles) static mesh into map.  You might also notice that the SetDynStreams\
      \ in the Hardware section of the [[Legacy:Console Commands/Stats Console Commands\
      \ (UT)|STAT]] console command is several milliseconds.  The solution is to either\
      \ set bCollideActors property to false for this large static mesh or add a simplified\
      \ collision shape.  See [[Legacy:Static Mesh Modeling|Static Mesh Modeling]]\
      \ for more or static mesh collision.\n\n;When I start unrealEd, the buttons\
      \ in the toolbox window (the one on the left) are blank. they don't have icons.\
      \ WTF? : This could be because you have misplaced or deleted your editorres\
      \ folder located within the System folder of all Unreal games.\n\n;I got a black\
      \ wall in my map, but there's a light in front. When I move light i can see\
      \ the lighning but when i rebuild the wall became black : I'm not sure what\
      \ causes this, but it can be fixed by moving the BSP a little bit in any direction.\n\
      \nSee [[Legacy:UnrealEd Bug List|UnrealEd Bug List]] for more.\n\n==Packages==\n\
      ; How do I share my level with others without sending all of the texture and\
      \ mesh packages? : See [[Legacy:MyLevel|MyLevel]].\n\n; How do I add packages\
      \ to be loaded at startup? : This is useful if you want to have access to the\
      \ actors your mod uses, or if you're always using the same resource packages.\
      \ Add the line \"EditPackages=MyPackageName\" to the [Editor.EditorEngine] section\
      \ of the [[Legacy:Game Ini File|game ini file]] (the exact section may change\
      \ with some games &ndash; look for similar lines).\n\n; How can you determine\
      \ what packages are used in a map?  I have a map that's failing to load but\
      \ I don't know what's causing the problem. : \n;* Use [[Legacy:UT Package Tool|UT\
      \ Package Tool]] to extract a list of used packages. \n;* Examine ''View ->\
      \ Log'' in UnrealEd and read the last log message - it will tell you what package\
      \ couldn't load.\n; Can static meshes be used to create the boundaries of zones\
      \ or must zones always be created with the zone portals touching BSP geometry\
      \ rather than static meshes : Only brushes that aren't [[Legacy:Volume|Volume]]s\
      \ can be used for that.\n\n; When I close UnrealEd I see a dialog box message\
      \ \"Package # Has Changed, Save It Now?\" : We think it's just a UnrealEd bug.\
      \ Say \"no\" and don't worry about it.\n\n; I've changed a static mesh/sound/etc\
      \ in my level, but when I next load/play the level, it contains an old version\
      \ of the mesh/sound/etc : This problem may occur if your various static mesh,\
      \ sound, etc packages have the same name ('''excluding the .usx, .uax etc extension''')\
      \ &ndash; see [[Legacy:Package Naming|Package naming]]. Of course, you also\
      \ may have forgotten to save your mesh/sound/etc packages after changing them.\n\
      \n; When I load my level in the editor, it says it's missing a static mesh/sound/etc\
      \ which I put in it last time I edited the level : Again, this may be a problem\
      \ with packages having identical names (excluding extension) &ndash; see [[Legacy:Package\
      \ Naming|Package naming]]. Or again, you may have forgotten to save the relevant\
      \ mesh/sound package after changing it.\n\n==General ==\n; Can I have dynamic\
      \ day/night switching in my map? : Yes, but the Hell if I know how! :)\n\n:You\
      \ could probably have a \"sun\" lightsource and a \"moon\" lightsource and a\
      \ mover to blank out one or the other? DodgyJon.\n\n; What is the player cap\
      \ in a UT2004 map or mod? Can I override the 32 player limit?\n\n; My screen\
      \ gets much brighter when UnrealEd starts : That is normal. UnrealEd uses the\
      \ same gamma correction setting as the game itself. To change the level, look\
      \ under [[Legacy:UnrealEd Advanced Options|UnrealEd Advanced Options]]. To start\
      \ UnrealEd with no correction at all, make a shortcut with \"UnrealEd.exe -nogamma\"\
      .\n\n; What is the acceptable polycount in maps? : About 50,000 for UT2003.\
      \ See [[Legacy:Polycount|polycount]].\n\n; How can I turn an 831K map into a\
      \ 6Mb monster at the click of a button? : Simple &ndash; just re-build everything\
      \ on the map.  It seems to be the lightmaps that are responsible for most of\
      \ the size increase although the bot path data has also been fingered as a contributing\
      \ factor.\n\n; (Merge this one with the above) Is there anything I can do to\
      \ keep my UT2003 maps a reasonable size? : Apart from using nothing but static\
      \ meshes and terrain no.  Once you get above around 200-300 brushes (normal\
      \ adds, subtracts etc) your map size will bloat for no obvious reasons.\n\n\
      ; How do I enable \"bright corners\" for [[Legacy:Surface|surface]]s? : You\
      \ can't.  That feature has been removed from UnrealEd 3. See [[Legacy:Surface\
      \ Properties Window|Surface Properties Window]] for the other flags.\n\n; How\
      \ are static meshes lit? : What I know so far: for regular static meshes, the\
      \ lighting is calculated per-vertex, and can be shadowed (per vertex) by BSP\
      \ geometry.  I assume, but have not confirmed, that this means the lighting\
      \ is calculated at build time, and movers and other dynamically lit static meshes\
      \ do not get this treatment.\n\n; Can I use AutoCad for building meshes and\
      \ such or am I stuck with Maya and that other 3D program? :  You can use Autocad\
      \  or Inventor to create meshes as long as as you save your mesh in iges format,\
      \ then you can import it into MAX 5 texture it then save it as a  ase file which\
      \ you can then import into UED 3 as a static mesh but if you texture your mesh\
      \ with a texture that is not an original texture be sure to import it into UED3\
      \ or you will have to rassign new textures to your mesh.\n\n; When I make static\
      \ meshes in UED they appear extremely bright.  How can I darken them? : In the\
      \ Display properties of the mesh, set bStaticLighting and bUseDynamicLights\
      \ true.\n\n; While making a skybox, the textures are smeared, and no manipulation\
      \ of the alignment seems to fix it. The picture is of a simple 1024 cube. What\
      \ is the solution? :\n@inline@TextureProblem\n\nThis is caused by the textures\
      \ you are using having their texture clamp mode set to TC_Clamp, rather than\
      \ TC_Wrap (which is the more usual setting &ndash; see [[Legacy:BitmapMaterial|BitmapMaterial]]\
      \ for more information). Basically, this means that they can't tile on surfaces\
      \ larger than their dimensions. To fix this, the texture must be scaled to the\
      \ exact size of the surface, and it must be aligned exactly to its edges (so\
      \ for example if you have a cube of size 512, and a texture of 256, simply double\
      \ it in the texture aligment properties, then make sure the texture is all aligned\
      \ up properly). To do this, you can either experiment with the [[Legacy:Texture\
      \ Pan|Texture Pan]] tool, or do the following:\n# In the [[Legacy:Surface Properties\
      \ Window|Surface Properties Window]], switch to the [[Legacy:Surface Alignment|Surface\
      \ Alignment]] tab, select \"Face\", then type in the correct scaling so the\
      \ texture will fit the surface exactly (so if your brush is a 1024 cube, and\
      \ the texture is also 1024, leave the scaling at 1)\n# Click \"Align\" to perform\
      \ the alignment\n# Switch to the Pan/Rot/Scale tab.\n# Press the \"1\" button\
      \ for each direction.\n\nIf that still doesn't fix it, look at the [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]]\
      \ cuts in Zone/Portal view. Clamping textures don't seem to cope well with cuts.\
      \ If this problem is in your skybox, the move it away from the rest of the map\
      \ to remove stray cuts.\n\n\n\n; I've tried to create a fluid object, i can\
      \ see the surface from above the water, but when i go under the water, i can\
      \ see straight through it and all the terrain around, how can i fix this?? :\
      \ Use a [[Legacy:Shader|Shader]] or [[Legacy:FinalBlend|FinalBlend]] to make\
      \ the texture two-sided.\n\n==Playtesting==\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Playtest|playtest]]ing.\n\
      \n; When I get in the game, all I and my bots do is die.  What's up? :\n;* \
      \ You didn't rebuild.  Do it.\n;* In [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]] make sure that\
      \ the KillZ level ''([[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]] or [[Legacy:Level Properties|Level\
      \ Properties]]?)'' is set correctly. Spawning below that level causes instant\
      \ death.\n;* It is possible you only have one playerstart, thus making a pile\
      \ of bots and you spawn onto each other making a mass telefrag. (this no longer\
      \ happens in UT2003)\n\n; I've changed my brightness, contrast and gamma and\
      \ am concerned that my lighting may appear incorrectly on other systems. If\
      \ a user changes their settings, that's fine but I need a known baseline for\
      \ setting up my lights. : Your current settings are under ut2003/system/ut2003.ini,\
      \ the default settings are under ut2003/system/default.ini. Defaults: Brightness=.800000,\
      \ Contrast=.700000, Gamma=.800000\n\n==Helper Tools==\n; Is there a list of\
      \ all the useful programs work with or around UnrealEd? : The Wiki holds a list\
      \ of [[Legacy:Application|Application]]s.\n\n; Where do you create [[Legacy:Static\
      \ Mesh|static mesh]]es? : These can be made from CSG geometry, but the best\
      \ way is with [[Legacy:Maya|Maya]]. Maya PLE is bundled on the third CD-ROM\
      \ and must be installed separately.\n\n==New from Unreal Tournament?==\n\nDo\
      \ you still work with [[Legacy:UnrealEd 2|UnrealEd 2]] in your sleep? Confused\
      \ by the new stuff?\n\n; Arg! What's a hardware brush? What's a static mesh?\
      \ : A non-animated mesh with per-poly (or simplified per-poly) collision that\
      \ is cached in video memory.  See [[Legacy:Hardware Brush|Hardware Brush]] for\
      \ details.\n\n==Comments==\n\n'''StarWeaver''': Ok, I'm not sure if I'm bringing\
      \ this up in the right place, but this is where we're told that Bright Corners\
      \ no longer exists in 200x, and this also goes with this section on coming from\
      \ UT99. There needs to be something in here about working around the lack of\
      \ bright textures. I've been beating my head against this problem all day; I've\
      \ got a ceiling I'm trying to make out of a flattened arch shape from the 2d\
      \ editor and it's got dark banding in the lightmap between each face.\n\nI've\
      \ searched around the forums and the wiki and the possible solutions I've come\
      \ up with are:\n* Use a static mesh instead (It's the Way of the Future.) This\
      \ is probably what I'll end up doing, but it makes it harder not only to do\
      \ dramatic lighting effects but to work with the texture selection / manipulation\
      \ in the editor, so I'll be waiting until I'm done with the texturing and layout.\n\
      * Use dynamic lighting. I know this will work, because every time I modify a\
      \ lightsource in the editor the preview looks great before I rebuild the lighting,\
      \ but it also won't work right with shadows, and if you have any regular light\
      \ source shining on the surface it will get some of the shadow effect.\n\nAnd\
      \ for the record, here's some things that DON'T help, at least in my case:\n\
      * Any of the surface flags that we have in UT2004.\n* Changing the lightmap\
      \ quality in any fashion.\n* Creating the brush as an addition vs a subtraction\
      \ or as a 2d-shape-editor extrusion vs a modified basic cylinder or as solid\
      \ vs semisolid.\n* Adding multiple lights in different formations and at different\
      \ distances or changing any of the settings except bDynamicLight.\n* Setting\
      \ the PolyFlags on the brush to 548622 or whatever used to correspond to Bright\
      \ Corners in the older engines.\n* Transforming the brush to a static mesh dosn't\
      \ work even for a temporary fill-in while building with a 2048-long brush, because\
      \ there just aren't enough vertexes.\n\nThis problem is really starting to bug\
      \ me, since it feels like the devs took out a feature designed to work around\
      \ a bug or issue with their lighting raytracer without actually fixing the raytracer,\
      \ and I'm really having a hard time comprehending why such a change was made.\
      \ In any event, I feel there should be a page or section on dealing with these\
      \ lighting glitches, but it could use more information than I can gather in\
      \ an afternoon.\n\n'''cancausecancer''': I wrote something for converting UT\
      \ maps to UT2004. I works fine but it still needs to create volumes and staticMeshes\
      \ and match textures/sounds better. It preserves lights*color, sounds (tries\
      \ to determine which sound is which), transporters, movers, pathing and pickups.\
      \ It's using a default staticMesh for movers until I can write something to\
      \ build a new staticMesh package. I'm looking for a list of which UT textures\
      \ match to UT2004 textures. So far I am only re-texturing using 20 textures\
      \ because guessing the textures is difficult, the best method I could come up\
      \ with was scanning the old texture names against a word list and putting a\
      \ weight on more exact names. Does anyone have a match up list by chance?\n\n\
