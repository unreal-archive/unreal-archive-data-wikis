      <p>While this may or may not be the way that <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
      \ text\" href=\"http://torlan.forerunners.org/\">Project Torlan</a> used, there\
      \ are severe limitations to this method that are not immediately apparent when\
      \ first thinking about this. First of all, this is not in any form bump mapping\
      \ of even remotely close to it. It simply looks like it to a certain extent\
      \ but nothing close to it at all. Thus there are some restrictions that I encountered:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>Light direction is assumed by LightMap</li>\n<li>Use of a lot of textures\
      \ - About 5 textures for 1 result</li>\n<li>It is not affected by lights</li>\n\
      <li>Increased CPU usage - I'm not sure what the percentage is, but because I\
      \ used a realtime texture it does use CPU to an extentas it is rendered per\
      \ frame.</li>\n<li>Limited light palette - The method used, must use a 256 color\
      \ texture</li>\n<li>Small resultant textures - The maximum texture size is 256\
      \ x 256. While I don't know what the result is like if the bump map overlay\
      \ is stretched over a large surface, 256 X 256 is rather small.</li>\n<li>Possible\
      \ texture errors - Some complex shaders do not render well on certain cards,\
      \ so a fallback option is recommended.</li>\n<li>Texture creation is at first\
      \ trial and error</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Benefits\"\

      Edit section: Benefits\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>So after all those possible limitations, there are some benefits however.</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>If you mimic the movement of anything nearby to the lightmap movement,\
      \ you may simulate proper bump mapping.</li>\n<li>There isn't a real noticeable\
      \ slow down when using this technique</li>\n<li>It is not scripted, thus artists/mappers\
      \ can do it</li>\n<li>The resultant texture is a shader, thus, it can be further\
      \ modified for other purposes</li>\n<li>More possibilites exist with this and\
      \ bump mapping is only 1 possibilty, more tinkering will result more issues</li>\n\
      <li>It is possible to mimic actual light with the introduction of scripting\
      \ [More on that in the future]</li>\n<li>It does enhance textures to look a\
      \ bit better than just standard Phong shading</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      <p><b>OlympusMons:</b> Good work snake, Ive seen the torlan version of this\
      \ while browsing through the quake 2 evolved forums. Anyways I would love to\
      \ see some scripted textures start happening, if at all possible. Here's a suggestion,\
      \ have you tried using a normal map as a detail texture?? Im not too sure but\
      \ this may give you some interesting results. Ive actually been wondering if\
      \ its possible to use a normal map as a decal so when you shoot a wall you get\
      \ the impression that you made a dent not just a flat looking thing.</p>\n<p><b>Xabora:</b>\
      \ Nice work on the tut... although the major diffrences by mine and your way\
      \ was that the diffuse ca be any size. I used 1 combiner layer for your 1 shader.</p>\n\
      <p>Added some missing info that you forgot or didn't know.</p>\n<p><b>Solid\
      \ Snake:</b> I do not see how using a Shader matters or not. In fact when using\
      \ a Shader you can still use any sized Diffuse texture you want, it does not\
      \ matter. Only in my example did I decide to use the same sized texture. The\
      \ actual end combination doesn't play any role what so ever, and it is only\
      \ the IceTexture part which matters. It is the IceTexture that does all the\
      \ work and whether or not I used a Shader or you used a Combiner play any significant\
      \ factor. In the end however, it doesn't really matter as it was just detailing\
      \ that using an IceTexture in this method and combining it with a standard texture\
      \ is all that mattered.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.107\

    text: "This page explains how to make a pseudo bump mapped texture.\n\n==Credits\
      \ ==\n\nFirst of all, I would like to say thank you to these people who helped\
      \ me to figure this thing out:\n* elmuerte: He had some ideas which led to final\
      \ compilation of what goes and where.\n* Plouj: He showed me a screenshot of\
      \ what UArchitect had in his Texture Browser.\n* UArchitect: He made the said\
      \ screenshot which displayed what he used for this technique.\n\n==Limitations==\n\
      \nWhile this may or may not be the way that [http://torlan.forerunners.org/\
      \ Project Torlan] used, there are severe limitations to this method that are\
      \ not immediately apparent when first thinking about this. First of all, this\
      \ is not in any form bump mapping of even remotely close to it. It simply looks\
      \ like it to a certain extent but nothing close to it at all. Thus there are\
      \ some restrictions that I encountered:\n\n# Light direction is assumed by LightMap\n\
      # Use of a lot of textures - About 5 textures for 1 result\n# It is not affected\
      \ by lights\n# Increased CPU usage - I'm not sure what the percentage is, but\
      \ because I used a realtime texture it does use CPU to an extentas it is rendered\
      \ per frame.\n# Limited light palette - The method used, must use a 256 color\
      \ texture\n# Small resultant textures - The maximum texture size is 256 x 256.\
      \ While I don't know what the result is like if the bump map overlay is stretched\
      \ over a large surface, 256 X 256 is rather small.\n# Possible texture errors\
      \ - Some complex shaders do not render well on certain cards, so a fallback\
      \ option is recommended.\n# Texture creation is at first trial and error\n\n\
      ==Benefits==\n\nSo after all those possible limitations, there are some benefits\
      \ however.\n\n# If you mimic the movement of anything nearby to the lightmap\
      \ movement, you may simulate proper bump mapping.\n# There isn't a real noticeable\
      \ slow down when using this technique\n# It is not scripted, thus artists/mappers\
      \ can do it\n# The resultant texture is a shader, thus, it can be further modified\
      \ for other purposes\n# More possibilites exist with this and bump mapping is\
      \ only 1 possibilty, more tinkering will result more issues\n# It is possible\
      \ to mimic actual light with the introduction of scripting [More on that in\
      \ the future]\n# It does enhance textures to look a bit better than just standard\
      \ Phong shading\n\n==Method [Solidsnake](to madness)==\n\n===Part 1===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Page1.png|center|Importing\
      \ the textures]]\n\nFirst you have to make your textures. You will need a minimum\
      \ of 3 textures with a possibility of a 4th for an opacity control.\n\n; Diffuse\
      \ : This is just a normal texture that you see normally in the game.\n\n; Lightmap\
      \ : This is gradient map that you use to simulate the lighting on the wall or\
      \ mesh. You can use a pregenerated lightmap from 3DSMax6 I believe. The darkest\
      \ color should be (0, 0, 0) while the brightest color should be (128, 128, 128)\
      \ ... experiement a little although I found that using that as the highest light\
      \ brightness did not overwash my diffuse in the end. This texture *must* be\
      \ 256 colors and 256 X 256 or the same texture size as you input for the IceTexture.\n\
      \n; Bumpmap : This is basically a texture which depicts the height of things\
      \ you want on the texture. The darkest color should be (1, 1, 1) and not (0,\
      \ 0, 0) and the brightest can be anything but (255, 255, 255). I found that\
      \ using a flat 128, 128, 128 of the middle of the height map and then I beleved\
      \ and embossed in Adobe to produce the height map. It is not the best method,\
      \ but by far the quickest. This texture *must* be 256 colors and 256 X 256 or\
      \ the same texture size as you input for the IceTexture. It is best to use a\
      \ grayscale image for this.\n\n; Optional Opacity : This controls the opacity\
      \ of the resultant bump map. It is this textures alpha which controls it, so\
      \ it can be merged with say the diffuse. But it is up to you. This allows some\
      \ extra control in the resultant effects.\n\n===Part 2===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Page2.png|center|Setting\
      \ up the IceTexture...]]\n\nThis is where you create the Ice Texture. Click\
      \ on File -> New. Select Real-Time Texture and select IceTexture. Enter the\
      \ size of the texture, 256 X 256 is usually what you want since it offers the\
      \ highest resolution. I'm not sure if this is just a code limit or an actual\
      \ engine limit. It could be possible to edit that value for some large ice textures\
      \ ...\n\nIn the appropriate fields enter the textures as shown in the image\
      \ (Glass=Bumpmap, Source=Lightmap). To test your bump map effect, click MoveIce\
      \ to false so that it moves your 'light map' instead. Play with the values.\
      \ To set your lightmap, turn off the moving and adjust the Amplitude to shift\
      \ the lightmap around.\n\n===Part 3===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Page3.png|center|Bringing\
      \ it all together.]]\n\nThis is where we bring everything together. Make a new\
      \ [[Legacy:Shader|shader]], and put the diffuse texture into diffuse, and then\
      \ add the ice texture to specular and then finally if you wish an alpha into\
      \ the specular mask.\n\nUse the shader in a map and you have your result.\n\n\
      I am sure there is many other things that you can toy with to get better results\
      \ such as the use of combiners and texture modifiers, but this is simply the\
      \ result.\n\nTo get matching bump map movements, adjust the Ice Texture to simulate\
      \ the movement.\n\n==Method [Xabora/Project Torlan]==\n\n===Part 1===\n\nImporting\
      \ of the Textures\n\n(Borrowed These)\n\n; Lightmap : This is gradient map that\
      \ you use to simulate the lighting on the wall or mesh. You can use a pregenerated\
      \ lightmap from 3DSMax6 I believe. The darkest color should be (0, 0, 0) while\
      \ the brightest color should be (128, 128, 128) ... experiement a little although\
      \ I found that using that as the highest light brightness did not overwash my\
      \ diffuse in the end. This texture *must* be 256 colors and 256 X 256 or the\
      \ same texture size as you input for the IceTexture.\n\nAdded Note: For a neutral\
      \ color/closest to the diffuse texture use (127,127,127).\n\n; Bumpmap : This\
      \ is basically a texture which depicts the height of things you want on the\
      \ texture. The darkest color should be (1, 1, 1) and not (0, 0, 0) and the brightest\
      \ can be anything but (255, 255, 255). I found that using a flat 128, 128, 128\
      \ of the middle of the height map and then I beleved and embossed in Adobe to\
      \ produce the height map. It is not the best method, but by far the quickest.\
      \ This texture *must* be 256 colors and 256 X 256 or the same texture size as\
      \ you input for the IceTexture. You can also use standard bumpmaps also (Must\
      \ be 256 colors), along with greyscale.\n\n===Part 2===\n\nSetting up the IceTexture...\n\
      \n(This is the same)\n\nThis is where you create the Ice Texture. Click on File\
      \ -> New. Select Real-Time Texture and select IceTexture. Enter the size of\
      \ the texture, 256 X 256 is usually what you want since it offers the highest\
      \ resolution. I'm not sure if this is just a code limit or an actual engine\
      \ limit. It could be possible to edit that value for some large ice textures\
      \ ...\n\nIn the appropriate fields enter the textures as shown in the image\
      \ (Glass=Bumpmap, Source=Lightmap). To test your bump map effect, click MoveIce\
      \ to false so that it moves your 'light map' instead. Play with the values.\
      \ To set your lightmap, turn off the moving and adjust the Amplitude to shift\
      \ the lightmap around.\n\n===Part 3===\n\nCombiners\n\nMake a new [[Legacy:Combiner|combiner]],\
      \ have the CombineOperation set to CO_Multiply.\n\nHave Material1 set as your\
      \ Diffuse Texture and Material2 as your Lightmap.\n\nApply the Combiner to a\
      \ texture add a light... bingo... you have more control over the lighting around\
      \ the bumpmap.\n\n===What else from here?===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_FinalRender.png|center|Bingo!]]\n\
      \nThis is a very elementry approach. There is still more things that are doable\
      \ such as the creation of bumpmapped models. While it is not possible to use\
      \ a scripted texture within the IceTexture (Otherwise it is possible to do a\
      \ lot more things), it may be possible to adjust other paramaters within IceTexture\
      \ through Unrealscript which leads to other such possibilities.\n\nYou can use\
      \ colors in your light maps, and they do produce pleasing results.\n\nOther\
      \ possibilities are the introduction of larger texture for IceTexture. It'd\
      \ be nice but I'm not holding my breath on that one.\n\nWell, I hope this it!\
      \ I spent an entire day and a sleepless night figuring this one out.\n\nAlmost\
      \ forgot, here is the link to download my texture that I created for this: http://forums.beyondunreal.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=86563\n\

      \ Good work snake, Ive seen the torlan version of this while browsing through\
      \ the quake 2 evolved forums. Anyways I would love to see some scripted textures\
      \ start happening, if at all possible. Here's a suggestion, have you tried using\
      \ a normal map as a detail texture?? Im not too sure but this may give you some\
      \ interesting results. Ive actually been wondering if its possible to use a\
      \ normal map as a decal so when you shoot a wall you get the impression that\
      \ you made a dent not just a flat looking thing.\n\n'''Xabora:''' Nice work\
      \ on the tut... although the major diffrences by mine and your way was that\
      \ the diffuse ca be any size. I used 1 combiner layer for your 1 shader.\n\n\
      Added some missing info that you forgot or didn't know.\n\n'''Solid Snake:'''\
      \ I do not see how using a Shader matters or not. In fact when using a Shader\
      \ you can still use any sized Diffuse texture you want, it does not matter.\
      \ Only in my example did I decide to use the same sized texture. The actual\
      \ end combination doesn't play any role what so ever, and it is only the IceTexture\
      \ part which matters. It is the IceTexture that does all the work and whether\
      \ or not I used a Shader or you used a Combiner play any significant factor.\
      \ In the end however, it doesn't really matter as it was just detailing that\
      \ using an IceTexture in this method and combining it with a standard texture\
      \ is all that mattered."
