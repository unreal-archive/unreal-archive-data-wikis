      <p>Most people have probably played Unreal 1 coop mode, or ONP coop, right?\
      \ The basic idea was \"play single-player levelswith your friends\". This mod\
      \ would take that a bit further, and improve on singleplayer while it's at it.\
      \ Heres a fewbasic ideas for the coop levels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-switch doors:\
      \ these doors only open when both switches are pressed at the same time, so\
      \ that means two people areneeded.</li>\n<li>Multi-position vehicles: wait,\
      \ never mind, these are already in UT2k4</li>\n<li>Distractions: killing the\
      \ monster guarding the switch will set of an alarm, and you need to press the\
      \ switch, what do youdo? simple, have one guy get his attention, and sneak up\
      \ on the switch SLOWLY so he cant hear you. just make sure yourfriend keeps\
      \ him distracted long enough to escape.</li>\n<li>Human ladder: The UTJB feature\
      \ strikes back, by standing on a friends shoulders, you can reach the switch\
      \ to open a dooror such.</li>\n<li>'Better' bosses: One thing annoying abut\
      \ the Unreal 1 bosses was that they didnt have a pattern or anything, it was\
      \ justshoot shoot shoot untill theyre dead. For this there could be bosses that\
      \ can only be damaged by shooting their back, sodistractions are needed again.\
      \ And of course he bosses who cant be hurt unless you do something in the boss\
      \ arena (likepress a switch to turn of the bosses shield) or can only be hurt\
      \ after doing a certain attack.</li>\n<li>Delayed lifts: Ah, lifts that move\
      \ when you stand on them, i've spent a lot of my time in Unreal 1 coop waiting\
      \ for thosethings to come back down so i can go up after someone. On really\
      \ crowded srvers, you could get stuck at the first lift forages and not get\
      \ to see the rest of the level at all because of someone finishing it. How about\
      \ a new mover type that waitsa bit after someone stands on it before it moves,\
      \ so more people can get on? How about using buttons like in real elevators\
      \ to move the lifts up/down? (UT1999 has movers like this, UT2003 needs custom\
      \ made for them)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Interested_Coders.2C_Mappers.2C_Whatevers\"\
