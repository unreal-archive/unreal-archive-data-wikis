      <p>This is an idea that I have been bouncing around for a while, and I think\
      \ would be quite feasible in the UT2003 engine.</p>\n<p>For those not in the\
      \ know, Rocket Jockey was a game released several years ago, in which players\
      \ ride rockets around an arena. Each rocket has cables you can launch, which\
      \ can be used for a variety of purposes, the main goal being to knock out your\
      \ opponents. Anyone can be knocked off their rocket, which obviously inflicts\
      \ quite a large amount of damage against the player. Once you are off the rocket,\
      \ people can drag you around with cables, tie you to posts, and beat up the\
      \ player with some rather satisfying crunches and screams.</p>\n<p>Note that\
      \ there's probably lots of stuff I've left out, feel free to search Google or\
      \ ask for more information, or add stuff if you've played the game.</p>\n<h3><span\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Every player starts on their rocket, an announcer\
      \ counts off, and the game starts.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      <p>While off the rocket, you are totally defenseless, thus the need to find\
      \ a rocket to get back on.</p>\n<p>On the rocket, you have 2 cable launchers\
      \ on each side at your disposal. Seeing as rockets go at a very high speed,\
      \ the cables can be used to attach to a pole, which lets you spin around and\
      \ change direction. You can also attach both cables together, so you can create\
      \ trip wires, tie players/objects to posts, whatever you can think of. Once\
      \ a player has been injured heavily enough, he is out of the game. The player\
      \ with the most points at the end wins.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      <p>Basically the maps are a large arena, with posts to swing off of, bombs and\

      \ but here's what I think we should do based on what I've been hearing (feel\
      \ free to make any changes)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This is the initial stage. The focus\
      \ should be on getting the basic gameplay mechanics coded, such as:\n<ol>\n\
      <li>Implementing a basic rocket</li>\n<li>Arena gametype</li>\n<li>Mechanics\
      \ for players once off the rocket - nothing too complex, things like tripping\
      \ and getting thrown around can be done later</li>\n<li>Simple HUD</li>\n</ol>\n\
      </li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>After we complete this stage, I'm thinking that the\
      \ game should be more or less feature complete compared to the original game.\
      \ Other things that should be done by now:\n<ol>\n<li>Grappling onto players/objects\
      \ - Possibly with Karma physics assuming that it's not too much of a hassle,\
      \ otherwise we can delay it to a later stage.</li>\n<li>Soccer and Racing game\
      \ types - If these don't delay things too much I think they could also be postponed,\
      \ but I'd like to get them done.</li>\n<li>Maps - We should have at least some\
      \ basic arena maps, enough that we could release something and it'd be fun.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Focus on polishing, balancing, and fixing bugs.\
      \ We should also start focusing on cosmetic stuff such as modeling/skinning\
      \ and static meshes, but I think that the bulk of that could be delayed for\
      \ future releases.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>This is the \"eye candy\" stage. By\
      \ now we should have some modelers/skinners/animators and mapmakers, and we\
      \ can focus on transitioning into something that looks purty.</li>\n</ol>\n\

      <hr />\n<p><b>Grincer:</b> (2nd of July 2005) I was trying to get some people\
      \ together on <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://rocketjockey.deviantart.com\"\
      >http://rocketjockey.deviantart.com</a> to work on a remake. As I see it now,\
      \ this website is the most promising one. I can't seem to see any dates on the\
      \ developments. It might be a good idea to have a bit of an overview on how\
      \ the developments are going now. I'm no programmer, just a real big fan of\
      \ this game. Because of the fantastic gameplay. I have posted a several links\
      \ to this Wiki site, keep up the good work! If you have any questions you can\
      \ contact me on grincerAThotmail.com (msn) or 11841021 (icq) or by mail at grincerATgmail.com.\
      \ Just mention in the subject 'Rocket Jockey'.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note that I have\
      \ no experience whatsoever, I just thought that it's a shame that this game\
      \ has not been done justice.</p>\n<p><b>Highlander:</b> OMG i loved this game\
      \ i never could find a copy of the full version but i played the demo too much.\
      \ I agree this could be quite interesting on the ut2k3 engine. A fair amount\
      \ of coding i think. Depends to what extent you could use karma to your advantage\
      \ (the ropes). Quite the idea.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Highlander, go to <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?name=Rocket+Jockey\"\
      >http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?name=Rocket+Jockey</a></p>\n<p><b>Highlander:</b>\
      \ Thank you for the link&#160;:). Unfortunately... it doesnt seem to like win2k...\
      \ so i will proceed to install win95 on my laptop.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I'd be willing\
      \ to help code this. Let me know. – Spike ICQ 3797129.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Naky:</b>\
      \ So it looks like a formal team has taken up this project now (goons, you know\
      \ who you are). We'll use this board to consolidate and talk about the project\
      \ until we get our site up and running.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Plane Guy:</b> Ok,\
      \ so this is how I see it. We should get some rudimentary basics working soon,\
      \ so that we can build on them at axemanic's afore-mentioned slow pace. I can\
      \ see making working rockets and grapple hooks (sans tripwires) easily with\
      \ placeholder models. The reason I want to get going is that people tend to\
      \ sit around arguing about features and getting nothing done. No one can argue\
      \ we don't need these features!&#160;:) Anyway, I'm off to have a closer look\
      \ at that KVehicle....</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Naky:</b> Agreed. Some of the basic\
      \ tasks for programming should be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the adjustment of the camera:\
      \ this'll be a third person view mod just like the original... maybe eventually\
      \ we can set something up where mousewheelup zooms in and mousewheeldown zooms\
      \ out but for now, just a basic behind-the-rocket camera view will do</li>\n\
      <li>tweaking of the kvehicle class: this function probably simulates a wheeled\
      \ vehicle pretty well but I'm not sure if it'll \"feel\" right for flying a\
      \ rocket</li>\n<li>firing the cables: just firing them for the moment, we can\
      \ worry about how they'll interact with the environment later on</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>Once we get those things settled, we can add to the list. Oh yeah, UT2K3\
      \ comes with 2 hover jetbike models. They're inside VehicleMeshes.usx I think.\
      \ Both are a little under 900 polys and we can use those two as placeholder\
      \ rockets for now. Anyway, for me, I have to sit down either tonight or tomorrow\
      \ and play the game a bunch so I can make a list of all the map models I need\
      \ to make. We might as well stay with the '20s theme for now too, even though\
      \ it'll look weird with the default character models. Something we can't help\
      \ until we find a character modeller, I suppose.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Highlander:</b>\
      \ You gents need any help lemme know... Currently pre-occupied with a few projects\
      \ but if I can pitch in I will. Have experience /w gametypes custom pawns /\
      \ controllers etc. I put a lot of thought into how to implement this a while\
      \ ago. One problem I see is the cables, specificly making them look good at\
      \ arbitary lengths (do we build em out of segments? or perhaps a single mesh\
      \ scaled?) Other issues are if you plan on using karma you need to work out\
      \ the replication for that stuff.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Camera adjustment: easy I can\
      \ have something together in a few minutes if you want it.</li>\n<li>I think\
      \ kVehicle is the best thing to subclass if you plan on using karma.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>I *think* karma objects can only be joined to karma objects, also\
      \ not sure if a karma object can be anchored to the world (so it doesnt move)\
      \ but that would make the interactions easy.. just restrict the pylons to be\
      \ KActors that are anchored to the world.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Naky:</b> Sure,\
      \ I don't see why not. This isn't a Something Awful goon project only. What\
      \ is your main thing? Programming, mapping, modelling, skinning? We have 2 programmers,\
      \ 1 modeller, 1 texture artist, one sound designer and one designer who is the\

    text: "==Rocket Jockey==\n\n===Summary===\n\nThis is an idea that I have been\
      \ bouncing around for a while, and I think would be quite feasible in the UT2003\
      \ engine. \n\nFor those not in the know, Rocket Jockey was a game released several\
      \ years ago, in which players ride rockets around an arena. Each rocket has\
      \ cables you can launch, which can be used for a variety of purposes, the main\
      \ goal being to knock out your opponents. Anyone can be knocked off their rocket,\
      \ which obviously inflicts quite a large amount of damage against the player.\
      \ Once you are off the rocket, people can drag you around with cables, tie you\
      \ to posts, and beat up the player with some rather satisfying crunches and\
      \ screams.\n\nNote that there's probably lots of stuff I've left out, feel free\
      \ to search Google or ask for more information, or add stuff if you've played\
      \ the game.\n\n===Gameplay===\n\nEvery player starts on their rocket, an announcer\
      \ counts off, and the game starts.\n\n====Mechanics====\n\nWhile off the rocket,\
      \ you are totally defenseless, thus the need to find a rocket to get back on.\
      \ \n\nOn the rocket, you have 2 cable launchers on each side at your disposal.\
      \ Seeing as rockets go at a very high speed, the cables can be used to attach\
      \ to a pole, which lets you spin around and change direction. You can also attach\
      \ both cables together, so you can create trip wires, tie players/objects to\
      \ posts, whatever you can think of. Once a player has been injured heavily enough,\
      \ he is out of the game. The player with the most points at the end wins.\n\n\
      ====Game Types====\n\n=====Arena=====\n\nBasically the maps are a large arena,\
      \ with posts to swing off of, bombs and powerups to collect, and fences to navigate\
      \ around. The goal of this is to knock out all your opponents using whatever\
      \ means neccesary.\n\n=====Racing=====\n\nA circuit-style map, this should allow\
      \ map-makers to have much more freedom in what to make. In this, players must\
      \ pass through various goals in order, as they traverse around the course. Note\
      \ that the original game only offered circuit maps, but once-through maps should\
      \ be feasible as well.\n\n=====Soccer=====\n\nAs the name implies, it's soccer,\
      \ only on rockets. Two goals on each side, one ball in the center for the players\
      \ to grab with cables. \n\n====Scoring====\n\nIn arena, different amounts of\
      \ points are given depending on the difficultly of the maneuver. Points are\
      \ awarded for inflicting damage upon the player or his rocket. \n\n----\n\n\
      ===Team===\n\nPlaneguy - Programming/Modelling/Map Making\n\nNaky - Designer\n\
      \n? - Sounds (Need a new sound d00d)\n\nNaky - Modeller\n\nMr. P - Programming\
      \ \n\nAxeManiac - Texture Artist\n\nZap! - Mapper\n\n? - Animator (only need\
      \ a couple of very small animations done, this would be an incredibly easy job)\n\
      \nAlso, if anyone's experienced in creating UV maps, we could really use your\
      \ help.  I'm doing them, but very slowly due to lack of time and skill ;-) Not\
      \ a critical thing, I'll get them all done eventually, just a matter of when.\n\
      \n===Timeline===\n\nOk, obviously a lot of this is still up in the air, but\
      \ here's what I think we should do based on what I've been hearing (feel free\
      \ to make any changes)\n\n#This is the initial stage. The focus should be on\
      \ getting the basic gameplay mechanics coded, such as:\n##Implementing a basic\
      \ rocket\n##Arena gametype\n##Mechanics for players once off the rocket - nothing\
      \ too complex, things like tripping and getting thrown around can be done later\n\
      ##Simple HUD\n\n#After we complete this stage, I'm thinking that the game should\
      \ be more or less feature complete compared to the original game. Other things\
      \ that should be done by now:\n##Grappling onto players/objects - Possibly with\
      \ Karma physics assuming that it's not too much of a hassle, otherwise we can\
      \ delay it to a later stage.\n##Soccer and Racing game types - If these don't\
      \ delay things too much I think they could also be postponed, but I'd like to\
      \ get them done.\n##Maps - We should have at least some basic arena maps, enough\
      \ that we could release something and it'd be fun.\n\n#Focus on polishing, balancing,\
      \ and fixing bugs. We should also start focusing on cosmetic stuff such as modeling/skinning\
      \ and static meshes, but I think that the bulk of that could be delayed for\
      \ future releases.\n\n#This is the \"eye candy\" stage. By now we should have\
      \ some modelers/skinners/animators and mapmakers, and we can focus on transitioning\
      \ into something that looks purty.\n\n===Modelling Tasks===\n\nThe stuff us\
      \ modellers gotta do for phase 1.\n\n=====Map Objects=====\n* Basic Stub - '''Completed\
      \ - Textured - DONE'''\n* Basic Pole - '''Completed - Textured - DONE'''\n*\
      \ Net (long, low) - '''Completed - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n* Net (short,\
      \ high) - Incomplete\n* Ball Ejection Port - Incomplete\n* Claw Stub - Incomplete\n\
      * Power-up Ring - '''Completed - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n* Cable-Changing\
      \ Spool - Incomplete\n* Billboard - Incomplete\n\n=====Balls=====\n* Soccer\
      \ Ball - Incomplete\n* Hover Tire - '''Completed - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n\
      * Steel Ball - '''Completed - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n* Beach Ball - '''Completed\
      \ - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n* Bomb - '''Completed - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n\
      \n=====Rockets & Rocket Related=====\n* 2 rockets: \n\n- Rucinsky's Radical\
      \ Rocket - '''Completed - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n\n- Helm's XR-1 \"Conquerer\"\
      \ - Incomplete\n\n- Fusellier - '''Completed - Ready for Texturing'''\n\n- Unlockable\
      \ Rocket - '''Completed - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n* 1 cable mesh with 2\
      \ different skins  - '''Completed - Not Ready for Texturing'''\n\n===Programming\
      \ Tasks===\n* Extend KVehicle into a rocket class, using KCar as a guide (only\
      \ simpler, since there's no wheels) - '''Petri:''' The rocket itself is pretty\
      \ much complete. Some things need to be changed but that shouldn't be very hard.\n\
      * 3rd person viewpoint for players - '''Petri:''' Complete for player controllers,\
      \ incomplete for vehicles.\n* New Hud - Plane Guy: '''Complete'''. Things may\
      \ be added in the future, but this has all the basics\n* New Gametype or Mutator\
      \ that removes weapons - '''Petri:''' Complete.\n\nPhase 2 has begun! '''We're\
      \ not dead yet!'''\n* New PlayerPawn to account for vehicle hit damage and effects?\
      \ - Incomplete\n* Grappling hooks and tow cable effect - Plane Guy: '''86.7%\
      \ Complete''' Now with 90% more KARMA\n* Attach grapple hooks shooters to rocket\
      \ - Incomplete\n* Enable grappling rockets - Plane Guy: '''Complete''' Hehe,\
      \ found out I can't aim down with P's behindview code, so I was just shooting\
      \ over it\n* Reveal Plane Guy is a retard - Plane Guy: '''Complete''' See above.\n\
      * Change gametype to spawn a rocket when a player logs in - Incomplete.\n\n\
      For now, we'll just drop a rocket or two in the level. Having a rocket spawn\
      \ with the player only on his first spawn looks like a quite bit of work we\
      \ don't want to get hung up on right now, especially when rockets are still\
      \ in development.\n\n----\n\n===Comments===\n\n'''xray:''' (3. october 2006)\

      \ I was trying to get some people together on http://rocketjockey.deviantart.com\
      \ to work on a remake. As I see it now, this website is the most promising one.\
      \ I can't seem to see any dates on the developments. It might be a good idea\
      \ to have a bit of an overview on how the developments are going now. I'm no\
      \ programmer, just a real big fan of this game. Because of the fantastic gameplay.\
      \ I have posted a several links to this Wiki site, keep up the good work! If\
      \ you have any questions you can contact me on grincerAThotmail.com (msn) or\
      \ 11841021 (icq) or by mail at grincerATgmail.com. Just mention in the subject\
      \ 'Rocket Jockey'.\n\n----\n\nNote that I have no experience whatsoever, I just\
      \ thought that it's a shame that this game has not been done justice. \n\n'''Highlander:'''\
      \ OMG i loved this game i never could find a copy of the full version but i\
      \ played the demo too much. I agree this could be quite interesting on the ut2k3\
      \ engine. A fair amount of coding i think. Depends to what extent you could\
      \ use karma to your advantage (the ropes). Quite the idea.\n\n----\n\nHighlander,\
      \ go to http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?name=Rocket+Jockey\n\n'''Highlander:'''\
      \ Thank you for the link :). Unfortunately... it doesnt seem to like win2k...\
      \ so i will proceed to install win95 on my laptop. \n\n----\n\nI'd be willing\
      \ to help code this. Let me know. &ndash; Spike ICQ 3797129.\n\n----\n\n'''Naky:'''\
      \ So it looks like a formal team has taken up this project now (goons, you know\
      \ who you are).  We'll use this board to consolidate and talk about the project\
      \ until we get our site up and running.\n\n----\n\n'''Plane Guy:''' Ok, so this\
      \ is how I see it. We should get some rudimentary basics working soon, so that\
      \ we can build on them at axemanic's afore-mentioned slow pace. I can see making\
      \ working rockets and grapple hooks (sans tripwires) easily with placeholder\
      \ models. The reason I want to get going is that people tend to sit around arguing\
      \ about features and getting nothing done. No one can argue we don't need these\
      \ features! :) Anyway, I'm off to have a closer look at that KVehicle....\n\n\
      ----\n\n'''Naky:''' Agreed.  Some of the basic tasks for programming should\
      \ be:\n* the adjustment of the camera:  this'll be a third person view mod just\
      \ like the original... maybe eventually we can set something up where mousewheelup\
      \ zooms in and mousewheeldown zooms out but for now, just a basic behind-the-rocket\
      \ camera view will do\n* tweaking of the kvehicle class: this function probably\
      \ simulates a wheeled vehicle pretty well but I'm not sure if it'll \"feel\"\
      \ right for flying a rocket\n* firing the cables: just firing them for the moment,\
      \ we can worry about how they'll interact with the environment later on\n\n\
      Once we get those things settled, we can add to the list.  Oh yeah, UT2K3 comes\
      \ with 2 hover jetbike models.  They're inside VehicleMeshes.usx I think.  Both\
      \ are a little under 900 polys and we can use those two as placeholder rockets\
      \ for now.  Anyway, for me, I have to sit down either tonight or tomorrow and\
      \ play the game a bunch so I can make a list of all the map models I need to\
      \ make.  We might as well stay with the '20s theme for now too, even though\
      \ it'll look weird with the default character models.  Something we can't help\
      \ until we find a character modeller, I suppose.\n\n----\n\n'''Highlander:'''\
      \ You gents need any help lemme know... Currently pre-occupied with a few projects\
      \ but if I can pitch in I will. Have experience /w gametypes custom pawns /\
      \ controllers etc. I put a lot of thought into how to implement this a while\
      \ ago. One problem I see is the cables, specificly making them look good at\
      \ arbitary lengths (do we build em out of segments? or perhaps a single mesh\
      \ scaled?) Other issues are if you plan on using karma you need to work out\
      \ the replication for that stuff.\n* Camera adjustment: easy I can have something\
      \ together in a few minutes if you want it.\n* I think kVehicle is the best\
      \ thing to subclass if you plan on using karma.\n\nI *think* karma objects can\
      \ only be joined to karma objects, also not sure if a karma object can be anchored\
      \ to the world (so it doesnt move) but that would make the interactions easy..\
      \ just restrict the pylons to be KActors that are anchored to the world. \n\n\
      ----\n\n'''Naky:''' Sure, I don't see why not.  This isn't a Something Awful\
      \ goon project only.  What is your main thing?  Programming, mapping, modelling,\
      \ skinning?  We have 2 programmers, 1 modeller, 1 texture artist, one sound\
      \ designer and one designer who is the guy who started this thread on Wiki so\
      \ far.  Right now we're mostly in the planning and preparation stage but starting\
      \ to get the basics down in certain areas.  We're also keeping the scope small\
      \ at first and expanding as we complete the tasks we outline so don't think\
      \ bad of us as a result =P\n\n----\n\n'''Killmaster:''' Ok, I added Team section.\
      \ I also added a basic Timeline, feel free to add things or modify it if you\
      \ think anything needs to be changed.\n\n----\n\n'''Naky:''' Added in the modelling\
      \ tasks and a section for the programmers.  Mr. P, who has decided to be a full\
      \ member now (yay!) and Plane Guy can work out what they need to do with each\
      \ other and list it, I guess.\n\n----\n\n'''Petri:''' Hay guys, I'm Mr. P.\n\
      \n'''MythOpus:''' Yo Mistah P ;)\n\n----\n\n'''Spike:''' Hey there...A few weeks\
      \ ago someone contacted me about this project but I lost the info. Could you\
      \ drop me a line again? I have a Web site with a bulletin board running, and\
      \ I could create a mod dev team board for you (see http://amishrabbit.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=10),\
      \ if you want to use something other than a Wiki to stay in touch (especially\
      \ because someone could just delete the whole thing). Drop me an ICQ to 3797129\
      \ or AIM Spikescape.\n\n----\n\n'''Plane Guy''' We're not dead yet!\n\n----\n\
      \n'''05-05-2003| Dodger_''' *pokes the body with a stick* '''Enable grappling\
      \ rockets - Incomplete. \"Karma actors do not do collision\" :P''': If they\
      \ don't do collision, then how does UT2k3 do the collision with the beams and\
      \ stuff when you fall down the pit in that ball game?\n\n----\n\n'''Plane Guy:'''\
      \ That's a karma actor (ragdoll) interacting with other karma actors (beams,\
      \ etc.) Once an actor gets handed over to karma, it does not handle \"game collision\"\
      \ events, at least not properly. Well, at least the grapple hook passes harmlessly\
      \ through the rocket (karma controlled) when I take a pot-shot at it. Since\
      \ it should grapple '''any''' actor, the only thing I can see different between\
      \ the rocket any any other actor, is that I've handed control of it to Karma.\n\
      \nOn a related note, it really pains me that I have to re-code th wheel on the\
      \ towing physics. If I find something - have some sort of epiphany - I'd swicth\
      \ over to Karma in a nanosecond. I don't trust the replication on it though.\
      \ Karma seens to work on a differnt plane than the rest of the game, it's just\
      \ that we get the priviledge to watch it's magic at work sometimes.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ This is partially true and partially not.. Karma does work independantly of\
      \ the regular physics, however, it is possible to make it interact with other\
      \ normal objects. Usually the beams and stuff that you hit are not \"karma objects\"\
      \ per se. If you want an object to collide with Karma objects, you have to call\
      \ KSetBlockkarma( true ) on that object. For \"towing\" you can use KAddImpulse,\
      \ or even put a KBSJoint between the hook and the rocket. Then an impulse applied\
      \ to the hook will cause a realistic \"tug\" on that point of the rocket.\n\n\
      ----\n\n'''Spike:''' Hey Plane Guy&ndash;let me know if you'd like my help with\
      \ audio. Contact info is in my previous post&rarr;and the offer for a message\
      \ board still stands, if you want it. (22 July 03)\n\n----\n\n'''MythOpus:'''\
      \ Hey!  Is this mod still in the construction phase?  It seems to have stopped\
      \ completely... or maybe someone hasn't had time to update progress?\n\n----\n\
      \n'''Naky:''' We ain't dead, we just moved underground to focus on the two major\
      \ ass problems we've been having with the Unreal engine.  We've got one of them\
      \ nailed and the other one somewhat so.  www.rocketwars.com has been regged\
      \ and we're about to move there soon, with our own forums.  Spike, if you're\
      \ still interested in helping with sound or additional programming, you're more\
      \ than welcome.  Sorry I haven't checked this page in such a long time, just\

      \ 2nd. \n\n----\n\n'''Zap!:''' I'm not dead either!  Ok, I just kinda got really\
      \ busy towards the end of school and kinda forgot about this.  I'm going to\
      \ be working on my mapping skills (and texturing egad!).  I'll see what I can\
      \ get done.  Since I'm a newbie with this stuff, I'll need to know what special\
      \ parts we'll need for our maps, if any.\n\n----\n\n'''Plane Guy:''' Just verifying\
      \ breathing status. We've done a lot, just not gone far. This is kind of a first\
      \ for most of us. I know the rockets have been redone, and this is the another\
      \ try at grappling hooks. I'm so happy Karma is involved now. It's so keen when\
      \ it's not raping my houseplants.\n\n----\n\n'''Naky:''' Okay guys, www.rocketwars.com\
