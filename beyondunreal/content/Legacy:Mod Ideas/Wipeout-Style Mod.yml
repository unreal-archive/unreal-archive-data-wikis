      \ posting here, but did it anyways... I've been looking around for a fast paced\
      \ futuristic racer mod for UT2k3/4 but didn't find any. So I thought, maybe\
      \ I should see if there are people interested in making one... I didn't know\
      \ where to look for coders, so I'll post around and ask a few contacts to see\
      \ if they know any.</p>\n<p>I can skin, uvw map and do your usual 2d stuff.\
      \ I know basic modeling too, but not *that* much.</p>\n<p>The point isn't that\
      \ I take all the credit for it like everyone thinks when someone makes a thread\
      \ like this. I want to see such a mod, and I don't care if I do it or someone\
      \ else does it. But since there aren't any mods out there that are like that,\
      \ I don't think one's gonna get made if I sit around on my ass and wait for\
      \ it to be made, so might as well try and see if I can find some people interested\
      \ in making it.</p>\n<p>What I think would be good about this mod is that it\
      \ won't be a machine hog, and people with average computers will be able to\
      \ play it without any slowdown.</p>\n<p>So, if there are any people interested\
      \ in this, especially coders, or wannabe coders who are learning and willing\
      \ to learn, PM or e-mail (synista@tatu.us) me, and if there are enough people\
      \ interested, might as well start something of it. I've posted something similar\
      \ on moddb, and there are people interested, but no coders so far.</p>\n<p>I'm\
      \ also in #tacticalops on gamesnet if anyone wants to talk about this.</p>\n\

      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I did go over to that forum thing, but instead of posting\
      \ on there, I'll write what I think about it here:</p>\n<p>The collision issue\
      \ they raise is SOMEWHAT valid, but questionably so. First off I'll say, scaling\
      \ down the world won't make a difference. The problem is the amount of distance\
      \ stepped per tick relative to the size of the objects. IE, the problem in UnrealSpeed\
      \ was moving from not colliding one tick to firmly planted the next tick. You're\
      \ gonna have the same problem no matter the scale, you may be impaled by less\
      \ UUs, but you're still gonna be impaled by just as much relative to the length\
      \ of the vehicle. Plus, the Unreal Engine is not completely scale independant,\
      \ things like sound and lighting still depend on scale. Also, speeding up the\
      \ gamespeed won't fix anything - you still get the same number of ticks per\
      \ real second, so if anything it would make the problem worse.</p>\n<p>Also,\
      \ the Unreal Engine is not a First Person Shooter engine. It's an all-around\
      \ game engine.</p>\n<p>Okay, now that I've said all that stuff... It's entirely\
      \ possible to avoid the problems UnrealSpeed had. The fighter craft in my space\
      \ combat mod can move at blistering rates and never have a problem with hitting\
      \ things.</p>\n<p>Karma does not automatically \"fix\" an object that becomes\
      \ lodged in another object because it doesn't know whether that's what you wanted\
      \ or not. It does provide an event, KImpact, that can be used in conjunction\
      \ with KImpactThreshold. KImpact means you hit something. Then all you have\
      \ to do is, inside that event, find out what you hit (Touchingactors iterator)\
      \ and decide whether to blow yourself to smithereens, richochet off forcefully,\
      \ take out the lamp post, etc. The Karma engine expects the programmer to do\
      \ this, and it doesn't appear that the UnrealSpeed team did so. (not that I'm\
      \ picking on UnrealSpeed, just stating my observations based on in-game behaviour\
      \ and the problem they've had with stuff getting lodged like that.)</p>\n<p>Anyways,\
      \ just thought I'd share some info on that.</p>\n<p><b>Synista:</b></p>\n<p>Well\
      \ I've set up a website and started recruiting people.</p>\n<p>I think this\
      \ is the best way to get the idea out to the public, and hopefully something\
