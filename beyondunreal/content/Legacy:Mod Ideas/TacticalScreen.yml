      <p>Do you know the multiview-screen from rocketarena v0.82? Based on this multiscreening\

      \ team (red/blue), to view every transloc-cam placed by a teammate. Use for\
      \ such a mutator is the observation of battles as a tactical supervisor. The\
      \ selected player may activate the tactical screen and have a TEAMMESSAGE-based\
      \ interface, with which he can send messages. (duh:)</p>\n<p>In messages, that\

      \ every disc can be given a user-defined name, (maybe built-in support for automatically\
      \ renaming in relation to the playername of the player who set the cam or it's\
      \ location, that would be \"PlayernameCAM\", or \"Red Cave\", etc.), which makes\
      \ ist easier for the teammates to understand the location of the disc.</p>\n\
