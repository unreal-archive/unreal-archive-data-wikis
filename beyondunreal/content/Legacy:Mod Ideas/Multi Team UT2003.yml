      \ GameType dependent code. It's possible basic DeathMatch code could be written\
      \ which could be built upon by subsequent gametypes. HUD and other scoring issues\
      \ for DeathMatch might be reusable as well, or maybe they wouldn't, I don't\

      \ idea here would be kind of similar to the OldSkool mod for UT: Additional\
      \ mods can be built on top of the mod. Sort of like a utility mod, although\
      \ it has its own basic elements that can be played on their own.</p>\n<p>My\
      \ idea for 6 team colors are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Red</li>\n<li>Blue</li>\n<li>Green</li>\n\
      <li>Yellow/Gold</li>\n<li>Purple</li>\n<li>Orange</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I suggest\
      \ those colors just because they are the 3 primary pigment colors and their\
      \ 3 products that every board game ever made is based on. Support for the \"\
      None\" or \"Gray\" team might also be added for DeathMatch.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
