      \ is the HUD. It stinks. In UT the team messages were in a decent place, and\
      \ your health and armour were co-located. You could also tell how much ammo\
      \ you had left for a weapon that you didn't have in your hands (the colours\
      \ in UT2003 are too similar).</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> Fixed that! When you\
      \ stated that, i kinda hate the hud of UT2003 too! You cannot make the hud transparent!</p>\n\
      <p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> Also, I hate that you have to use the number keys for\
      \ choosing messages in the [v] dialogue box!</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Yeah.\
      \ If you use the voice menu <i>a lot</i> it is actually quicker to do it the\
      \ way they have done it. However, for occasional use (since I generally setup\
      \ keybinds) the implementation is awful. The other thing I find irritating is\
      \ the fact that all messages are in upper case. I know they were porting a TV\
      \ console game, but come on ...</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Seems to me that it'd\
      \ be a lot easier to port the announcer from UT2003 to Unreal Tournament than\
      \ everything else from Unreal Tournament to UT2003.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ lol - but where's the challenge in that? I must confess, I prefer the UT2003\
      \ weapons over the UT ones. My issues with UT2003 are more to do with the maps,\
      \ diversity, and HUD. Mostly the HUD to be honest.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>\
      \ In Americas Army, the numbers for the radio are fine, because you don't need\
      \ them as often in it.</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b> very similar to the UTClassic\
      \ mutator..</p>\n<p><b>Darkwarrior:</b> The announcer should be easy to make\
      \ for UT2003 because of the support for custom announcers added with the epic\
      \ bonus pack.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.020 seconds\n\
