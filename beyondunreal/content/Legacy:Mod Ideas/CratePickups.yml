      <p><b>DJPaul:</b> What pickups could we replace with boxes? -&gt; Adrenaline,\
      \ Ammo, etc.</p>\n<p>Also, my brother came up with an idea that sounds somewhat\
      \ similar to some Q3 mod i've vaguely heard of - spawning boxes throughout the\
      \ entire level; each box is worth one point, and a frag 3. There's a timelimit,\
      \ and the person who gets the most points, wins!</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>\
      \ It will be cool if those 8's would desinegrate (did I spell that right?) when\
      \ they fall into water, slime, and lava like biodegradable peanuts. After they\
      \ desinegrate, they will leave a cloudy, slippery mess.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ In outdoor areas, when a create is destroyed, it should leave behind a pickup\
      \ that doesn't respawn. Instead, a crate should randomly fall from the sky (hopefully\
      \ dquashing a player&#160;:) ). It could do with a \"random contents\" option\
      \ that spawns objects in the same ratio as they were added to the level. An\
      \ option to have the crates spawn randomly around the level would also be nice.</p>\n\
      <p><b>DJPaul:</b> Not sure about that \"random contents\" option - the point\
      \ of these things is to contain items (such as health). Should the crates respawn\
      \ after the power-up is collected, but the wreckage of the old one remain?</p>\n\
      <p>Thinking about it, if we did let them respawn, I suppose you COULD choose\
      \ the crates to respawn randomly.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> The objects will\
      \ have to respawn anyway. If the crates themselves don't respawn then it makes\
      \ sense to keep the crate wreckage around for those objects that have these\
      \ new fangled platforms to sit on - maybe remove it for those that don't. If\
      \ you want to respawn the crates then you would want to get rid of the wreckage\
      \ to prevent a big pile of destroyed crates from killing framerate. And if you\
      \ respawn the crates then it's only a small step to having randomly respawning\
      \ crates with vanishing wreckage.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> The wreckage should\
      \ dissapear when a new box regenerates.</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b> Yes, the box\
      \ \"wood\" will disappear, but the 8s are staying.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>\
      \ Shouldn't the 8s dissapear when they fall into slime, lava, water, or being\
      \ shot at?</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Wonder if you can get the 8s to be \"\
      pushed aside\" when a player runs through them. That would be really cool. You\
      \ could simluate wind and get drifts of 8s ..... (I'll get me coat).</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>\
      \ You probably could, but what would be really cool is that there would be a\
      \ sound that sounds like walking though them, like walking through autumn leaves!</p>\n\
      <p><b>DJPaul:</b> There is wind built into UT, so i'm *very* confident you could\
      \ get things to \"fly\" in them.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> I will be willing\
      \ to create the decoration for the 8s!</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b> Add your name\
      \ to the Interested Scripters/Contributers section then</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b>\
      \ ZxAnPhOrIaN - please email me at djpaul@djgenerationx.com</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>\

      \ Sounds like a cool idea.&#160;:) If you'd like some more complication, you\
      \ can also set a minimum and maximum for the amount of crates and just have\
      \ them respawn every few seconds up till the maximum. Just as soon as the amount\
      \ of crates drops below the minimum it'll immediatly spawn one.<br />\nMaybe\
      \ you can also have some sort of effect on the disappearing of the wood, like\
      \ a fade like decals or add some karma to it and have it slowly lift up like\
