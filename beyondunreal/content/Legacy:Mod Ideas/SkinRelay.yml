      <p>I learned how to skin characters last night. It's very easy - see <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Skinning\" title=\"Legacy:Skinning\">Skinning</a>. Now I learn that\
      \ it's unlikely that anyone else will get to see my character. The problem is\
      \ that the skin is local to my machine. Other players can only see skins they\
      \ have on their machines. The documentation out there suggests you send your\
      \ skin to your buddies so they can see you. This doesn't really work in the\
      \ world of broadband and global gaming, where you just show up to any server\
      \ you can find and join in. The result is that the cool skins are hosted on\
      \ the web and server admins might download them ... or they might not.</p>\n\
      <p>Why can't the players in a game download one another's skins through the\
      \ game server? It seems that the answer to this is that it would be a significant\
      \ download burden (someone out there said a typical skin with its model and\
      \ textures would be about 12Mb, I've not verified this).</p>\n<p>Individual\
      \ skins for individual players are thus limited to clans who have a friendly\
      \ serveradmin. This mod idea seeks to remedy this situation, so anyone with\
      \ UPaint (that's everyone!) can put their face on their character and all the\
      \ people they play with can see it.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
