      \ Might be good on a CTF map, too, but I think a DM map offers more chaos. If\
      \ it sounds like a Mutant variant, it is.</p>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b> To do: TeamAI,\
      \ SquadAI, Prophet FX</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> From how it sounds, the FP isn't\
      \ so false (with all these divine powers and all)</p>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b> Depends\
      \ on your perspective, I guess. \"My god is real, yours is a false prophet.\"\
      \ kinda thing.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b> It never happened.&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> That sounds like a neat idea.. kind of like a dual escort\
      \ kind of gametype. Anyways.. the only problem I can see with the scoring system\
      \ as it stands is that people will probrably not WANT to be the prophet. The\
      \ only way to score points is by killing people and the prophet is not particularly\
      \ good at doing so, having only a shield gun. Sure, it's in the best interests\
      \ of the team for a good player to be the prophet, but players like having big\
      \ numbers beside their name on the scoreboard because the general impression\
      \ is that it will impress the other players. How about something like the original\
      \ domination - the prophet and the prophets team accumulate points as time passes,\
      \ and the longer the prophet has been the same person, the faster those points\
      \ will accumulate. That provides incentive to keep the prophet alive as long\
      \ as possible. For instance, when a player first becomes the prophet, that player\
      \ and the team accumulate points at a rate of, say, 1 per 3 seconds. After the\
      \ prophet has been alive for, say, a minute, the team and that player would\
      \ be accumulating points at a rate of say, 1 point per second. Or something.\
      \ The numbers need tweaking, but I think it would make gameplay a bit more emotional\
      \ and exciting, due to the increased stress and important of protecting/assasinating\
      \ the opposing prophet as he/she/it becomes more venerable.</p>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b>\
      \ Some good ideas there, Fox. Since I'm new to scripting, I have to be flexible\
      \ with what I think I can do vs what I can do. It seems that I'm having problems\
      \ with bot AI in that the prophet gets stuck trying to pick up health even though\
      \ I've made sure that WantsPickups(Bot) returns false if the bot is the prophet.\
      \ WantsPickups is apparently a hack that was implemented into AI for the Mutant\
      \ gametype. As a result, I may have to come to a compromise that maybe the prophet\
      \ isn't completely unarmed, but maybe he has less of an ammo capacity....and\
      \ maybe his health is ticking away. That keeps him on the move and adds some\
      \ stress. <b>And maybe the idea of a \"false prophet\" is completely gone and\
      \ the gametype should just be \"Team Marked Men\" or \"Team Bodyguard\".</b>&#160;:)\
      \ Actually it would fix the problem you describe Fox, because prophets would\
      \ be more lethal. Maybe even give them 2 points per kill. I feel like I'm bastardizing\
      \ the gameplay now because I'm not quite the coder I need to be.</p>\n<p>How\
      \ about this?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>prophets have health ticking away</li>\n<li>prophets\
      \ can use any weapons</li>\n<li>kill a prophet get 1 team point</li>\n<li>kill\
      \ a prophet get 10 player points</li>\n<li>kill a player get 1 player point</li>\n\
      <li>kill a player if you're a prophet, get 2 player points</li>\n<li>kill a\
      \ prophet if you're a prophet, get 20 player points</li>\n<li>prophets have\
      \ full access to pickups</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OTOH, I really like the idea of the\
      \ increased point accrual but I don't think I have the experience to work with\
      \ states just yet. And if that's the case, there definitely needs to be an \"\
      objective\" placed on the prophet. Hell, there might need to be anyway since\
      \ I haven't yet done a Spectate BotMatch. Kind of a bummer that my lack of experience\
      \ is causing the gameplay to suffer. I need a mentor.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b>\
      \ WOW! Just had a breakthrough. I used the above changes and it \"feels\" so\
      \ much better. Shortly after my teammate became the prophet, other team mates\
      \ starting showing up and taking defensive positions. When the prophet moved,\
      \ everyone else followed and pretty much surrounded him. An enemy showed up\
      \ and the squad completely railed on him. Eventually an enemy became a prophet\
      \ as well. Him and a few other of his squad were firing on me from a distance.\
      \ I turned on god mode and ran straight for them. As I approached, a squad member\
      \ and the prophet started retreating. Two of them held strong and didn't move\
      \ until they were far enough from their prophet to catch back up with him.</p>\n\
      <p>I'm going to do a LOT more testing and run it through spectate botmatch (thanks\
      \ Mychaeel!!) and see what their orders/tactics are. Scoring has a bug. If I\
      \ get this scoring bug fixed and come up with a better \"glow effect\" for my\
      \ prophet, I think I'll be in business!</p>\n<p>(hahah. see the above? that's\
      \ was a brief moment when I thought it was MY ai that was working)</p>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b>\
      \ Thanks for your help everyone. I'm sure you'll find problems but I did my\
      \ best. (Heck, even I found problems.)</p>\n<p><b>Dark Pulse:</b> Well I'll\
      \ give it a run-through tonight. My Run-through will be more in-depth once I\
      \ get my better vidcard in about 2 or so weeks.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I did\
      \ not \"torture test\" the gametype, but I did a few tests and found the following:</p>\n\

      \ with the second line and both problems were fixed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bots\
      \ get killed rather easily. I understand that you had some difficulties with\
      \ the AI, it probrably just needs playing around with. The bots clustered together\
      \ in a ball and then the entire \"ball\" stormed into the enemy \"ball.\" Good\
      \ leadership demonstrated on the part of the prophet, but results in rather\
      \ high fatality rates for the prophet.&#160;:P The clustering also made the\
      \ bots very vulnerable to massed weapons fire and especially area effect weapons\
      \ like rockets. I'm not too sure about how the AI scripts work, but it might\
      \ be possible to separate a team into a bodyguard group and a hunting group.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b> My AI is, in retrospect, horrible. It's just pathetic.\
      \ Hindsight being what it is, I shouldn't have released. It's still playable\
      \ but it feels like an amatuer mod. I have sections of AI code that just don't\
      \ fire off properly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The scoreboard shows all bot's orders as\
      \ \"sweeping.\" This probrably isn't hard to fix, but I haven't experimented\
      \ with it yet so I couldn't tell you how it is done.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I didn't test it, but I'm not sure how well\
      \ this gametype would operate with a \"max lives\" setting in the gamerules.\
      \ This could maybe be changed so that it only counts as a \"life\" if you die\
      \ while you are the prophet.. with \"Max Lives\" there isn't really any significance\
      \ to who is the prophet since the winner is the team with people left on it.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I pictured the glow being more like the one illustrated in\
      \ the screenshot on the download page.. where Diva has a glowing breastplate.\
      \ Also cool would be a \"halo\" around the person's head, but that might be\
      \ too religeon-specific. I have a couple of ideas how the glow might be made\
      \ better, but on the other hand maybe you like it just the way it is. Do you\
      \ mind if I decompile the .u file and try some other effects to see what I can\
      \ come up with?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b> So did I. That was a screenshot\
      \ from a running game test. Then something got wacky with my emitters. They\
      \ were sticking to the floor after death and the framerate was dropping to 30,\
      \ 20, 8, 4, 1 FPS as the game went on. All the while, emitters are hanging around.&#160;:(\
      \ Since I was literally compiling new versions every 10 minutes, I ended up\
      \ losing the good code.</p>\n<p>Eventually, it came down to crunch time and\
      \ I mistakenly released a less than optimum mod so I could theoretically get\
      \ in the MSU contest. I underestimated the competition and got a little burnt\
      \ out working 6 hrs a night for the past two weeks. Yes, it's embarassing to\
      \ admit it but TFP took a massive amount of time.</p>\n<p>By all means, decompile.\
      \ I'll warn you. It isn't pretty. I bastardized the following: xMutantPawn,\
      \ xMutantGame, CTFGame, MutantGlow and a few more that will become apparent.\
      \ I think my biggest mistake was \"TryToIntercept\"</p>\n<p>My goal for October\
      \ is to rework what I've done. Maybe start from scratch. I think the concept\
      \ is a good one but was poorly delivered on. And there's so much that could\
      \ be done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Random translocate when becoming prophet</li>\n<li>Announcements\
      \ &amp; text display \"A new false prophet has risen\", \"False prophet grows\
      \ stronger\"</li>\n<li>Better, more custom HUD</li>\n<li>Combo: Eye of God (any\
      \ visible enemies get hit with a lightning gun shot emenating from the prophet)</li>\n\
      <li>Bring back emitter fx</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I was a fool for thinking I could\
      \ come up with a competitive mod in two weeks. Lesson learned. Still humble.&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Kerlin:</b> As part of the rewrite, I'm lopping out just about everything\
      \ but the minimum required gameplay rules. I don't know how the game can even\
      \ be played. I've got to tip my hat to Epic for filling in the gaps because\
      \ there are some <b>major</b> problems with setting who the prophet is. My question\
      \ is this: is there some way I can figure out what team a subclassed TeamAI\
      \ and SquadAI are on? ProphetSquadAIs get created by ProphetTeamAI which is\
      \ created by the Prophet class. But which Team is the squad on? Definitely need\
      \ to figure that out before I can say who is an enemy and friendly prophet.&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Hmm. I couldn't say about the AIs, I don't use any of that\
      \ AI scripting stuff in my mod. The emitter in that screenshot was very cool\
      \ looking. I'm not sure how you got it to only come out of the breastplate like\
      \ that, unless it was just a coincidence that it lined up like that. Anyways,\
      \ if you have a problem with emitters sticking around it shouldn't be hard to\
      \ fix, but I'd have to see it to be sure. I wouldn't worry too much about the\
      \ MSU contest.. there's three phases anyway, and the first one isn't really\
      \ a biggie. You'll be able to resubmit false prophet to the second one if it's\
      \ improved a bunch anyway. The most important thing I think for that contest\
      \ is that the mod has to be fun.. they probrably won't grade it based on how\
      \ long it took to make or how complex it is, so I wouldn't worry about that.\
      \ The best gametype one I can't foresee having that much competition anyway.</p>\n\
      <p><b>VonStrohmen:</b> Both SquadAI and TeamAI have a 'Team' variable which\
      \ points to the TeamInfo of that squad, which will tell you what team the bot\
      \ is on by comparing to the TeamIndex variable (0 = red, 1=blue). In SquadAI,\
      \ you can also call the function FriendlyToward to see if that squad will set\
      \ another pawn as an enemy. You can also access the TeamAI associated with TeamInfo\
      \ by using the AI variable in UnrealTeamInfo (since UnrealTeamInfo is subclass\
      \ thats actually used anyways). Alternatively, if you have a subclass of Bot,\
      \ you can just use the SameTeamAs function, or directly call Level.Game.IsOnTeam.\
      \ In short, there are lots of ways to whether a Prophet is friendly towards/on\
      \ the same team as one of your squads or bots.</p>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b> Thanks\
      \ VonStrohmen. As I said, I've been focusing on better understand what's going\
      \ on rather than trying to modify an existing class (like CTFSquadAI). I'm more\
      \ interested in doing it the right way (and understanding how/why) than just\
      \ getting it done...time is on my side right now. With all of the places I can\
      \ figure out what team someone is on I guess we can categorize this question\
      \ under \"duh\".</p>\n<p>I'll dig up my code, Fox. I zipped up the entire directory\
      \ five or six times during this whole fiasco and I think that I've got one saved\
      \ where the emitter is working. I know my starting point was xMutantPawn and\
      \ MutantGlow from the BonusPack directory. I believe I just changed the colors\
      \ and the offsets. I'll dig for it and let you know, though. I figure it's the\
      \ least I can do for all the help everyone's given me.&#160;:)</p>\n<p>And yes,\
      \ it was coincidence for the most part since I clearly don't know what I'm doing\
      \ half the time.&#160;:P</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Hey Kerlin, are you still working\
      \ on this? I was sitting around in the senior computer lab at university today\
      \ and I didn't have the source for my mod there but I had UT2003 so I decided\
      \ to play around and see if I could come up with something interesting. Then\
      \ I remembered the emitter effect from this mod and thoughts I could whip up\
      \ something. I'll probrably post the souce up here tomorrow, but I came up with\
      \ a neat \"flaming halo\" emitter that can go around the prophets head, and\
      \ I could probrably add some more fanciness to it too. Anyways, I don't have\
      \ classes tomorrow but if I stop by the university I;'ll post the source up\
      \ here.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.074 seconds\nReal\

      \ infidel. The rest of the team protects their \"god\".\n\nStatus: Completed...as\
      \ best I can. :)\n\nDownload it [http://www.kerlinsoftworks.com/ut2k3/falseprophet\
      \ here]\n\n==Rules:==\n\n* A false prophet (FP) is chosen at random at the start\
      \ of the game\n* The FP is armed only with his shield\n* The FP's shield regenerates\
      \ at 2x speed of the normal shield\n* Team members within <i>n</i> radius of\
      \ the prophet regenerate health\n* (alt) Team members within <i>n</i> radius\
      \ of the prophet have health leeched\n* FP gets 1 adrenaline every second\n\
      * When the FP is destroyed, the highest (or lowest?) ranked team member becomes\
      \ the false prophet\n* Each time the FP is destroyed, the opposing team's score\
      \ increases by 25 points\n* Each time someone kills a member of the other team,\
      \ his score increases by 1\n* New FP automatically gets <i>n</i> adrenaline\
      \ for free\n\n==Update==\n* Dropped prophet ever getting adrenaline (pickup\
      \ or otherwise) and gave prophet permanent slight speed/jump height increase\n\
      * Dropped prophet leeching/healing health for now\n* Changed scoring to 1 kill\
      \ of prophet = 1 point, period.\n* First killer on team becomes prophet\n* If\
      \ prophet dies, the next \"first kill\" after the prophet's death becomes prophet\n\
      \n----\n\n'''Kerlin:''' Sound like fun? :) Might be good on a CTF map, too,\
      \ but I think a DM map offers more chaos. If it sounds like a Mutant variant,\
      \ it is.\n\n'''Kerlin:''' To do: TeamAI, SquadAI, Prophet FX\n\n'''Mosquito:'''\
      \ From how it sounds, the FP isn't so false (with all these divine powers and\
      \ all)\n\n'''Kerlin:''' Depends on your perspective, I guess. \"My god is real,\
      \ yours is a false prophet.\" kinda thing. :)\n\n'''Kerlin:''' It never happened.\
      \ :)\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' That sounds like a neat idea.. kind of like a dual escort\
      \ kind of gametype. Anyways.. the only problem I can see with the scoring system\
      \ as it stands is that people will probrably not WANT to be the prophet. The\
      \ only way to score points is by killing people and the prophet is not particularly\
      \ good at doing so, having only a shield gun. Sure, it's in the best interests\
      \ of the team for a good player to be the prophet, but players like having big\
      \ numbers beside their name on the scoreboard because the general impression\
      \ is that it will impress the other players. How about something like the original\
      \ domination - the prophet and the prophets team accumulate points as time passes,\
      \ and the longer the prophet has been the same person, the faster those points\
      \ will accumulate. That provides incentive to keep the prophet alive as long\
      \ as possible. For instance, when a player first becomes the prophet, that player\
      \ and the team accumulate points at a rate of, say, 1 per 3 seconds. After the\
      \ prophet has been alive for, say, a minute, the team and that player would\
      \ be accumulating points at a rate of say, 1 point per second. Or something.\
      \ The numbers need tweaking, but I think it would make gameplay a bit more emotional\
      \ and exciting, due to the increased stress and important of protecting/assasinating\
      \ the opposing prophet as he/she/it becomes more venerable.\n\n'''Kerlin:'''\
      \ Some good ideas there, Fox. Since I'm new to scripting, I have to be flexible\
      \ with what I think I can do vs what I can do.  It seems that I'm having problems\
      \ with bot AI in that the prophet gets stuck trying to pick up health even though\
      \ I've made sure that WantsPickups(Bot) returns false if the bot is the prophet.\
      \ WantsPickups is apparently a hack that was implemented into AI for the Mutant\
      \ gametype. As a result, I may have to come to a compromise that maybe the prophet\
      \ isn't completely unarmed, but maybe he has less of an ammo capacity....and\
      \ maybe his health is ticking away. That keeps him on the move and adds some\
      \ stress. '''And maybe the idea of a \"false prophet\" is completely gone and\
      \ the gametype should just be \"Team Marked Men\" or \"Team Bodyguard\".'''\
      \ :) Actually it would fix the problem you describe Fox, because prophets would\
      \ be more lethal. Maybe even give them 2 points per kill. I feel like I'm bastardizing\
      \ the gameplay now because I'm not quite the coder I need to be.\n\nHow about\
      \ this?\n# prophets have health ticking away\n# prophets can use any weapons\n\
      # kill a prophet get 1 team point\n# kill a prophet get 10 player points\n#\
      \ kill a player get 1 player point\n# kill a player if you're a prophet, get\
      \ 2 player points\n# kill a prophet if you're a prophet, get 20 player points\n\
      # prophets have full access to pickups\n\nOTOH, I really like the idea of the\
      \ increased point accrual but I don't think I have the experience to work with\
      \ states just yet. And if that's the case, there definitely needs to be an \"\
      objective\" placed on the prophet. Hell, there might need to be anyway since\
      \ I haven't yet done a Spectate BotMatch. Kind of a bummer that my lack of experience\
      \ is causing the gameplay to suffer. I need a mentor. :)\n\n'''Kerlin:''' WOW!\
      \ Just had a breakthrough. I used the above changes and it \"feels\" so much\
      \ better. Shortly after my teammate became the prophet, other team mates starting\
      \ showing up and taking defensive positions. When the prophet moved, everyone\
      \ else followed and pretty much surrounded him. An enemy showed up and the squad\
      \ completely railed on him. Eventually an enemy became a prophet as well. Him\
      \ and a few other of his squad were firing on me from a distance. I turned on\
      \ god mode and ran straight for them. As I approached, a squad member and the\
      \ prophet started retreating. Two of them held strong and didn't move until\
      \ they were far enough from their prophet to catch back up with him. \n\nI'm\
      \ going to do a LOT more testing and run it through spectate botmatch (thanks\
      \ Mychaeel!!) and see what their orders/tactics are. Scoring has a bug. If I\
      \ get this scoring bug fixed and come up with a better \"glow effect\" for my\
      \ prophet, I think I'll be in business!\n\n(hahah. see the above? that's was\
      \ a brief moment when I thought it was MY ai that was working)\n\n'''Kerlin:'''\
      \ Thanks for your help everyone. I'm sure you'll find problems but I did my\
      \ best. (Heck, even I found problems.)\n\n'''Dark Pulse:''' Well I'll give it\
      \ a run-through tonight. My Run-through will be more in-depth once I get my\
      \ better vidcard in about 2 or so weeks.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I did not \"torture\
      \ test\" the gametype, but I did a few tests and found the following:\n\n====Actual\
      \ Bugs====\n* Teams weren't loaded properly. The \"team set up\" option uses\
      \ the \"no teams\"/deathmatch opponent selection instead of the team game opponent/teammate\
      \ selection. It also nukes the \"game rules\" if you try to play a different\
      \ gametype after playing false prophet. Both of these problems were the result\
      \ of a slight error in the .int file. At any rate this line is in the distributed\
      \ .int file:\n\n<uscript>\nObject=(Class=Class,MetaClass=Engine.GameInfo,Name=Prophet.Prophet,Description=\"\
      DM|Team False Prophet|XInterface.MapListTeamDeathMatch|true\")\n</uscript>\n\
      \nWhich should read:\n\n<uscript>\nObject=(Class=Class,MetaClass=Engine.GameInfo,Name=Prophet.Prophet,Description=\"\
      DM|Team False Prophet|xinterface.Tab_IATeamDeathMatch|xinterface.MapListTeamDeathMatch|true\"\
      )\n</uscript>\n\n'''Kerlin:''' Good catch. Damn...here I go again.... \"Thanks!\"\
      \ :)\n\nI tested it with the second line and both problems were fixed.\n\n*\
      \ The bots get killed rather easily. I understand that you had some difficulties\
      \ with the AI, it probrably just needs playing around with. The bots clustered\
      \ together in a ball and then the entire \"ball\" stormed into the enemy \"\
      ball.\" Good leadership demonstrated on the part of the prophet, but results\
      \ in rather high fatality rates for the prophet. :P The clustering also made\
      \ the bots very vulnerable to massed weapons fire and especially area effect\
      \ weapons like rockets. I'm not too sure about how the AI scripts work, but\
      \ it might be possible to separate a team into a bodyguard group and a hunting\
      \ group.\n\n'''Kerlin:''' My AI is, in retrospect, horrible. It's just pathetic.\
      \ Hindsight being what it is, I shouldn't have released. It's still playable\
      \ but it feels like an amatuer mod. I have sections of AI code that just don't\
      \ fire off properly.\n\n* The scoreboard shows all bot's orders as \"sweeping.\"\
      \ This probrably isn't hard to fix, but I haven't experimented with it yet so\
      \ I couldn't tell you how it is done.\n\n====Just Ideas====\n\n* I didn't test\
      \ it, but I'm not sure how well this gametype would operate with a \"max lives\"\
      \ setting in the gamerules. This could maybe be changed so that it only counts\
      \ as a \"life\" if you die while you are the prophet.. with \"Max Lives\" there\
      \ isn't really any significance to who is the prophet since the winner is the\
      \ team with people left on it.\n\n* I pictured the glow being more like the\
      \ one illustrated in the screenshot on the download page.. where Diva has a\
      \ glowing breastplate. Also cool would be a \"halo\" around the person's head,\
      \ but that might be too religeon-specific. I have a couple of ideas how the\
      \ glow might be made better, but on the other hand maybe you like it just the\
      \ way it is. Do you mind if I decompile the .u file and try some other effects\
      \ to see what I can come up with?\n\n'''Kerlin:''' So did I. That was a screenshot\
      \ from a running game test. Then something got wacky with my emitters. They\
      \ were sticking to the floor after death and the framerate was dropping to 30,\
      \ 20, 8, 4, 1 FPS as the game went on. All the while, emitters are hanging around.\
      \ :( Since I was literally compiling new versions every 10 minutes, I ended\
      \ up losing the good code.\n\nEventually, it came down to crunch time and I\
      \ mistakenly released a less than optimum mod so I could theoretically get in\
      \ the MSU contest. I underestimated the competition and got a little burnt out\
      \ working 6 hrs a night for the past two weeks. Yes, it's embarassing to admit\
      \ it but TFP took a massive amount of time.\n\nBy all means, decompile. I'll\
      \ warn you. It isn't pretty. I bastardized the following: xMutantPawn, xMutantGame,\
      \ CTFGame, MutantGlow and a few more that will become apparent. I think my biggest\
      \ mistake was \"TryToIntercept\"\n\nMy goal for October is to rework what I've\
      \ done. Maybe start from scratch. I think the concept is a good one but was\
      \ poorly delivered on. And there's so much that could be done:\n\n* Random translocate\
      \ when becoming prophet\n* Announcements & text display \"A new false prophet\
      \ has risen\", \"False prophet grows stronger\"\n* Better, more custom HUD\n\
      * Combo: Eye of God (any visible enemies get hit with a lightning gun shot emenating\
      \ from the prophet)\n* Bring back emitter fx\n\nI was a fool for thinking I\
      \ could come up with a competitive mod in two weeks. Lesson learned. Still humble.\
      \ :)\n\n'''Kerlin:''' As part of the rewrite, I'm lopping out just about everything\
      \ but the minimum required gameplay rules. I don't know how the game can even\
      \ be played. I've got to tip my hat to Epic for filling in the gaps because\
      \ there are some '''major''' problems with setting who the prophet is. My question\
      \ is this: is there some way I can figure out what team a subclassed TeamAI\
      \ and SquadAI are on? ProphetSquadAIs get created by ProphetTeamAI which is\
      \ created by the Prophet class. But which Team is the squad on? Definitely need\
      \ to figure that out before I can say who is an enemy and friendly prophet.\
      \ :)\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Hmm. I couldn't say about the AIs, I don't use any of\
      \ that AI scripting stuff in my mod. The emitter in that screenshot was very\
      \ cool looking. I'm not sure how you got it to only come out of the breastplate\
      \ like that, unless it was just a coincidence that it lined up like that. Anyways,\
      \ if you have a problem with emitters sticking around it shouldn't be hard to\
      \ fix, but I'd have to see it to be sure. I wouldn't worry too much about the\
      \ MSU contest.. there's three phases anyway, and the first one isn't really\
      \ a biggie. You'll be able to resubmit false prophet to the second one if it's\
      \ improved a bunch anyway. The most important thing I think for that contest\
      \ is that the mod has to be fun.. they probrably won't grade it based on how\
      \ long it took to make or how complex it is, so I wouldn't worry about that.\
      \ The best gametype one I can't foresee having that much competition anyway.\n\
      \n'''VonStrohmen:''' Both SquadAI and TeamAI have a 'Team' variable which points\
      \ to the TeamInfo of that squad, which will tell you what team the bot is on\
      \ by comparing to the TeamIndex variable (0 = red, 1=blue). In SquadAI, you\
      \ can also call the function FriendlyToward to see if that squad will set another\
      \ pawn as an enemy. You can also access the TeamAI associated with TeamInfo\
      \ by using the AI variable in UnrealTeamInfo (since UnrealTeamInfo is subclass\
      \ thats actually used anyways). Alternatively, if you have a subclass of Bot,\
      \ you can just use the SameTeamAs function, or directly call Level.Game.IsOnTeam.\
      \ In short, there are lots of ways to whether a Prophet is friendly towards/on\
      \ the same team as one of your squads or bots.\n\n'''Kerlin:''' Thanks VonStrohmen.\
      \ As I said, I've been focusing on better understand what's going on rather\
      \ than trying to modify an existing class (like CTFSquadAI). I'm more interested\
      \ in doing it the right way (and understanding how/why) than just getting it\
      \ done...time is on my side right now. With all of the places I can figure out\
      \ what team someone is on I guess we can categorize this question under \"duh\"\
      .\n\nI'll dig up my code, Fox. I zipped up the entire directory five or six\
      \ times during this whole fiasco and I think that I've got one saved where the\
      \ emitter is working. I know my starting point was xMutantPawn and MutantGlow\
      \ from the BonusPack directory. I believe I just changed the colors and the\
      \ offsets. I'll dig for it and let you know, though. I figure it's the least\
      \ I can do for all the help everyone's given me. :)\n\nAnd yes, it was coincidence\
      \ for the most part since I clearly don't know what I'm doing half the time.\
      \ :P\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Hey Kerlin, are you still working on this? I was sitting\
      \ around in the senior computer lab at university today and I didn't have the\
      \ source for my mod there but I had UT2003 so I decided to play around and see\
      \ if I could come up with something interesting. Then I remembered the emitter\
      \ effect from this mod and thoughts I could whip up something. I'll probrably\
      \ post the souce up here tomorrow, but I came up with a neat \"flaming halo\"\
      \ emitter that  can go around the prophets head, and I could probrably add some\
      \ more fanciness to it too. Anyways, I don't have classes tomorrow but if I\
      \ stop by the university I;'ll post the source up here."
