    text: "<ul>\n<li>By working on the project you will automatically be part of the\
      \ first game test. There will be a poll (you obviously cannot vote for yourself)\
      \ that will pick who gave the most for the project. The top 8-9 people (i'm\
      \ still deciding if I would be one) will be team leaders. If you want to be\
      \ part of the game you have to contribute!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, onto the project\
      \ itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is called Project Massive. There is a planet with\
      \ 9 moons. Each moon is like a planet of its own, each with it's own terrain,\
      \ climate, and therefore mutators. Each team starts with a moon under their\
      \ control. The planet is a neutral zone. There will be two winners. The first\
      \ will be who manages to control 5 moons at one time. That team will become\
      \ neutral until later (they can do whatever they want, if anything, they already\
      \ won). Their moons will become unowned, open for capture. The next team to\
      \ capture 5 moons is the other winner. The two winning teams will play one,\
      \ just ONE, onslaught game for the championship.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CAPTURING:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Each moon has two bases: the Capitol and the Bay. The Capitol holds\
      \ an artifact that anyone can carry, multiple people at once as well. If someone\
      \ (not the same team) gets the artifact, they may go to the planet and touch\
      \ the artifact at the neutral base. If that happens, that team has successfully\
      \ captured that moon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Bay is the base where you appear when\
      \ you land on the planet (ala Landing Bay). It is positioned opposite of the\
      \ Capitol. So, to get to the Capitol you must travel across the planet, then\
      \ you must either hijack a ship or go all the way back to the Bay to get one.</p>\n\
      <p>THE PLANET:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No name yet. On the planet there are colleseums,\
      \ training warrooms, and just about anything else that MMORPGer would want.\
      \ When you connect to the game, you are put on the planet. When you fly to a\
      \ moon under your team's control, you land in the Capitol, not the Bay.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>WEAPONS/ITEMS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get weapons on the planet. Well,\
      \ not weapons, weapon packages. Your character has a master weapon which can\
      \ transform into any weapon in the game. By completing quests, winning tournaments,\
      \ or even just getting twinked, you can get weapon packages which allow you\
      \ to use that weapon. We will use some of the weapons from the game, but I plan\
      \ on making tons exclusively for this.</li>\n<li>There will also be items, which\
      \ will affect things like your HP, Starting Ammo, and other stats.</li>\n<li>Weapons\
      \ also have levels, which will be explained next.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>XP:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>First things first: There are no player levels. There is, however,\
      \ XP. There is Total XP and then regular XP. Your total xp is more for comparison\
      \ to other players, it is all the xp you've ever had, including what you have\
      \ now. XP is used for everything. For example, some weapon packages require\
      \ you to buy level upgrades with XP. Some actually start at level 0, so you\
      \ have to upgrade for it to be functional.</li>\n<li>You gain XP by completing\
      \ quests, winning games (collesseum), and just plain out fragging.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>GAMES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several games, mostly in the collesseum (some\
      \ special ones in quests and such). Most of the games (besides onslaught) are\
      \ in the colleseum, as well as others which will be exclusive to this. There\
      \ will only be the favorite levels in the colleseum, and only so many games\
      \ at once (otherwise there would be way to much at once).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>TRAVEL:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Travel from moon to moon (to planet) is simple. You get in a space\
      \ vehicle (I hate the ones included in the game, the ships will be completely\
      \ redone) and fly to where you want to go. Just like in any part of this, you\
      \ can attack others in space. However, the only way to land is to go to a landing\
      \ bay, or the capitol if you own the moon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>DEATH:</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>You do not lose XP for death. You lose it for losing at games, losing captured\
      \ moons, etc. When you die in space, you are regenerated to the bay on the planet.\
      \ When you die on the planet, you are regenerated to the pub (regen spot). When\
      \ you die on a moon, you are regenerated to the Capitol or Bay if you own the\
      \ moon or not, respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>STORYLINE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Though\
      \ there is no storyline during the actual game, I am going to make a machinima\
      \ to go along with it. All I really need is voice actors, as the rest will be\
      \ done by me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is like an MMORPG,\
      \ each game will take place 1-3 months at a time. You can rejoin as many times\
      \ as you want, but you will always be on the same team (the one you were picked\
      \ to be on).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I need members for this project! I will\
      \ have a site up soon!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Image Gallery: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
