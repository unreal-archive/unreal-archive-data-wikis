      \ in Battlefield 1942. Have each team start with their \"Power Core\" at the\
      \ same level, which slowly drains at a rate equal to the ratio of the Power\
      \ Nodes they control. For example, if a team controls all the nodes, their \"\
      Core\" doesn't drain at all and their opponents' drains at the maximum rate.\
      \ If both teams control half the Nodes, both \"Cores\" drain at one-half the\
      \ maximum rate. You could even change the stealing to occur after a certain\
      \ amount of time within the \"radius\" of the Node. (I know a lot of people\
      \ who weren't very interested in UT2003 when it came out because they felt the\
      \ gametypes were inferior to that of BF1942; I disagree, but a gametype like\
      \ this would go a long way towards bridging that gap.)</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit\
