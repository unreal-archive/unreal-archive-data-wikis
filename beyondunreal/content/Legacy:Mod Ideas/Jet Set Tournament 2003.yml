      \ a feature best described as \"lock strafing\". When you face an enemy within\
      \ a certain range, a cursor appears on them, and pressing a button causes your\
      \ view to lock to them, so that skating forward makes you follow them, and skating\

      \ weapons that are short-range, have slow projectiles, or work only as melee\
      \ weapons. In particular, slow-moving projectiles could make very interesting\
      \ dodging. I'd also be interested in different degrees of conversion - from\
      \ just a lock strafing mutator, with possibly also Deathmatch based on the JSRF\
      \ \"Tagger's Tag\" mode, where you have to paint opponents at very close range\
      \ from behind, up to possibly full conversion, with maps that have rails, graffiti\
      \ tag points, and everything. The last option has amusing visual possibilities\
      \ - consider, say, Gorge, grinding down a rail on inline skates, doing flips\
      \ and other stunts&#160;;-) I'm also nowhere near being able to tackle such\
      \ a project now, but I'm just putting the idea out there to see what others\
      \ think of it, and maybe I'll start looking at it more seriously when I decide\
