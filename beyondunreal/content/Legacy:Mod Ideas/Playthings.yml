      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Sounds fun!</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I think that the \"impulse\
      \ rifle\" may defeat the purpose of making it non-violent, since you could easily\
      \ use it to knock people off ledges to their doom, and all.</p>\n<p><b>Uncommon:</b>\
      \ Yes, falling damage is an issue to be resolved. Of course it depends on what\
      \ map you're playing. Anyway, \"falling to your doom\" could be replaced with\
      \ \"falling until you get teleported back to your base\". Being returned to\
      \ your base is basically what replaces dying in this mod. The \"suicide\" key\
      \ would become more of a \"retreat\" key, and it may become more useful since\
      \ many of the weapons will be designed to incapacitate. You either wait for\
      \ the effect to wear off, or give up and go home to try again.</p>\n<p><b>Uncommon:</b>\
      \ Another idea I've had is that any time your falling speed is such that hitting\
      \ the groud would cause you damage (perhaps above a certain threshold), you\
      \ automatically get returned to base. It also occurred to me that games like\
      \ StarCraft could be a good source of non-lethal weapon ideas. Imagine being\
      \ able to use stuff like Hallucinations&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Foogod:</b> I like\
      \ it! Here's another idea: Woozy Gun – Hitting an opponent with this gun makes\
      \ their view onscreen waver back and forth for a little while.. makes it really\
      \ hard to run/shoot in a straight line. (for bots, just mess with their navigation/targetting\
      \ AI)</p>\n<p><b>Bullet:</b> Just made the Impulse Rifle: If you hit ground\
      \ you get knocked back, if you hit an enemy he gets knocked back even harder.\
      \ The thing with pulling towards you could be easily implemented. But for now\
      \ the weapon is build for learnings sake and I don't know wether the code is\
      \ clean enough to publish it here...</p>\n<p><b>T-1:</b> Huh, wierd coincidence,\
      \ I made the exact same weapon for my mod Slaughter, and I haven't even read\
      \ this before. The pulling can be done with negative momentum transfer. My version\
      \ doesn't knock the firer back though. It's perfect for killing stuff by pulling\
      \ vehicles toward you and you jump out of the way but the person you're trying\
      \ to hit with it probably won't even see the vehicle coming.</p>\n<p><b>Bullet:</b>\
      \ Sounds great&#160;:D Need to try that!</p>\n<p><b>Zxanphorian:</b> I like\
      \ this idea, but i think they should be kinda like relics or inventory, that\
      \ you rotate through/use with different keys. The mesh would be on the opposite\
      \ hand the weapon is in. I think this would get rid of being defenseless when\
      \ you are attacked, until you switch to a normal weapon.</p>\n<p><b>Bullet:</b>\
      \ To be honest I think CTF for example wouldn't be playable with this mod. Think\
      \ of FaceClassic and the Impulse Gun which lets you travel from base to base\
      \ in no time. Or the Drop Gun would make the game like Instagib! What do you\
      \ think of what to do to balance it a bit better?</p>\n<p><b>Uncommon:</b> How\
      \ would the impulse gun help you travel? Also, there's a big difference between\
      \ the Drop Gun and Instagib: you can pick the flag up again. It just slows down\
      \ your getaway, and gives your pursuers a chance to get the flag before you\
      \ can retrieve it.</p>\n<p><b>Bullet:</b> Oops I just noticed that your definition\
      \ of a Impulse Gun does NOT include pushing yourself forward if hitting ground\
      \ instead of a player pawn&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>RabidZombie:</b> What if you had\
      \ a swap gun as a one shot superweapon. You fire and it will home on to the\
      \ person within a distance of the crossair and when it arrives you swap possition\
      \ with the other person. Lots of things could be achived and you wont be able\
      \ to use it well at all times, it would add a real tactical (some reason I can't\
      \ spell the word all of a sudden) edge, as you could jump off the edge then\
      \ use it, swapping your seemingly doomful situation with your opp's peaceful\
      \ walk. Using it to get further means the enimy might be nearer to your base,\
      \ so you got to use it at the righ time!</p>\n<p><b>Uncommon:</b> I like it&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>SoH_Ghost3021:</b> Can i help? this looks like fun...</p>\n<p><b>Uncommon:</b>\
      \ I don't know, can you?&#160;:) I think the basic steps to getting this made\
      \ are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brainstorm some weapons</li>\n<li>Pick a well-rounded,\
      \ well-balanced set from the brainstorming</li>\n<li>If talent is available,\
      \ make custom models, skins, and sounds</li>\n<li>Make suitable HUD modifications,\
      \ like hiding heath &amp; shields (or come up with a substitute)</li>\n<li>Lots\
      \ of playtesting!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>RabidZombie:</b> Although i don't know\
      \ how old this is, I HAVE thought of a new gun! It could be called the 'Nuts\
      \ Gun'(altogth a name change is more than likely&#160;:P) Basicly it randomly\
      \ swaps round the primary and secondary movement controls(seperatly to avoid\
      \ having 2 downs on the arrow buttons... maybie) and it will also swap the fires,\
      \ jump and crouch buttons and also maybie give a nutty hud like the llama on\
      \ JailBreak! Maybie another super weapon, Slow charge time, or a gun which could\
      \ be toned down a touch... Wow, when I think about it, I can think of loads\
      \ of unharmful guns...</p>\n<p>Also another gun could be the double vision gun...\
      \ The person affected sees double (or more) of people (and maybie items) around\
      \ him, so he can't tell the real from the fake...</p>\n<p>Also the substitute\
      \ for the Hud, maybie you could rearange it so you have a Charge area (maybie\
      \ giving you ammo for the less power ful of the guns) a score indicator and\
      \ maybie and friend radar (turn off-able by an option of course&#160;;) )</p>\n\
      <p><b>Uncommon:</b> One complication with changing controls, vision, and stuff\
      \ like that is it affects the player more than the game play, so bot support\
      \ would be tricky. I think those debilitating-type weapons also need to be balanced\
      \ with ones that are actually offensive or have other useful functions.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Marduk2:</b> Umm, I got an idea for two items, Rocket Boots, they make\
      \ you move super fast in one direction for a while, but if you hit anything\
      \ you stop immediately and trip so you have to get back up.</p>\n<p>and the\
      \ Spy pad, it places a small black disc on teh ground that makes any player\
      \ who steps on it look like a member of the opposite team, this could let them\
      \ sabotage the enemy's efforts.</p>\n<p><b>Marduk2:</b>well for the brainstorming\
      \ part, I could help if you'd like. I think I have some pretty good ideas.</p>\n\
