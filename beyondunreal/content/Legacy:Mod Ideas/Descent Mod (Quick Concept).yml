      \ his own unique craft. There are two types of \"hull\" available. A small light\
      \ hull, ideal for \"flag run\" type work and a heavier hull whos purpose is\
      \ to fight. Each hull has a set number of \"spaces\" (to be decided) that can\
      \ be assigned to the following components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shield generator (comes\
      \ in 4 variations capable of storing 50, 100, 150, and 200 shield units and\
      \ taking 1, 2, 3, and 4 spaces respectively).</li>\n<li>Power generator (Variations\

      <li>Weapons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each filled space takes up a set amount of weight\
      \ - this is used to determine how fast the craft can accelerate.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ I'd probably suggest three types of hulls, think Phoenix (less armor, more\
      \ speed), Pyro (medium/allround), Magnum (heavily armored, sloooow&#160;;))\
      \ like in Descent 3.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Power\">Power</span><span\

      <p>All components of the craft require a base amount of power to function -\
      \ so having a power generator that will support the components you've added\
      \ to the craft is important. Most components take time to recharge. If there\
      \ is spare power left over once all of the \"base power\" needs of the components\
      \ have been satisfied the components within craft can recharge over time. Players\
      \ can set the order in which devices are recharged. Spare power may also be\
      \ used to repair any damage on the craft. This will happen automatically if\
      \ all components of the craft are at full charge. Players can elect to turn\
      \ weapon components (and the engine) off in order to make more power available.</p>\n\
      <p>Engines can store a limited amount of charge for a quick \"boost\". This\
      \ boost simply doubles the acceleration the engine can provide for a short while\
      \ and increases the maximum speed of the craft by 10%.</p>\n<p>Weapons store\
      \ power to enable them to fire. Each shot uses up a set amount of energy. Once\
      \ the energy for a weapon has run out the weapon will not function until it\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The number of weapons has been kept fairly low deliberately.\
      \ Each weapon type comes in a few flavours that take up more space/power. The\
      \ laser weapons have variations that take up more power but use less space.</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Pulse Laser - A medium fire weapon that fires a single bolt of energy\
      \ in a straight line. These weapons are unique in that the base power requirement\
      \ of the laser can be increased to boost the power without any additional increase\
      \ in space usage. Alternatively, the power of the laser can be increased by\
      \ using more space without any additional cost in base energy use. There are\
      \ four levels of laser. The level 4 laser does 4 times as much damage as the\
      \ level 1 laser.</li>\n<li>Flash Laser - A rapid fire laser weapon that fires\
      \ twice as fast as the Pulse laser. All the same rules apply to the Flash laser\
      \ as the Pulse laser. The Flash laser has a base power rating twice that of\
      \ the Pulse laser.</li>\n<li>Cannon - A rapid fire hit-scan weapon (the only\
      \ one in the game). There are four variations of this weapon (taking 2-5 spaces).\
      \ Version 1 does moderate damage and has a low energy store. Version 2 has a\
      \ small increase in damage but a larger (2x?) energy store. Version 3 does twice\
      \ as much damage as version 1 but has the same sized energy store. Version 4\
      \ does slightly more damage than version 3 but has a larger (2x?) engery store.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>Ideally it should be possible to tell from the look of the craft the\
      \ sort of weaponry that has been attached (and maybe the type of power plant\
      \ as well).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mines - These standard defensive weapons come in\
      \ a few flavours, with each flavour requiring more base power, more space, or\
      \ both. The types of mine available are:\n<ul>\n<li>Dumb mine - These mines\
      \ float where they are put and explode on contact with any craft. These mines\
      \ will explode if they bump into walls.</li>\n<li>Rubber mine - These mines\
      \ bounce off walls and only explode if they hit an enemy craft. If the team\
      \ mine variant of these mines is used.then \"friendly\" players can bump the\
      \ mines to give them a bit of speed and send them off down a corridor.</li>\n\
      <li>Proximity mine - These mines explode if any craft comes within a certain\
      \ range</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>Team aware mines (they don't explode\
      \ when collided with by friendly players) can be produced by doubling the base\
      \ power requirement. Mines take a lot of energy to produce and last for up to\
      \ a minute before self-destructing.</dd>\n</dl>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
