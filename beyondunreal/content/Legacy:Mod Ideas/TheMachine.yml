      \ mix of a confrontation between a Mars commercial/exploration corporation named\
      \ Athena and an underground resistance movement with the acronym R.A.M. (Resistance\
      \ Against the Machine). To get off Mars, the player must either help out Athena\

      \ salesman, he needs help to overcome the obstacles in his path to reach the\
      \ goal of getting off Mars. A new technology called Advanced Learning Modules\
      \ (ALM's) will help him to do this.</p>\n<p>ALM's are devices that one can use\
      \ by inserting the prongs of the device into one's nostrils, which then the\
      \ device locates a nerve stem to the brain and then uploads or teaches the brain\
      \ a new skill or other knowledge that one would normally have to spend many\
      \ days learning. The player will either be given and/or have to find or purchase\
      \ these ALM's throughout the game. Skill related ALMs acquired by the player\
      \ will always be an upgrade if the player already has already acquired that\
      \ skill. There are three skill levels per ALM except for the vehicle ALM given\
      \ to the player's character in the opening movie sequence, which has only one.\
      \ There is a limited amount (ten) of ALM's that the player can be able to use\
      \ before his brain goes into overload.</p>\n<p>The list of ALMs skills are vehicle,\

      \ weapons with a futuristic aspect to them. The weapon list includes a blaster\
      \ pistol, stun-gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, assault rifle, and rocket launcher.\
      \ The blaster pistol and stun-gun will be the only weapons that will not need\
      \ ammo, but they have a charge limit and once that is reached they need to recharge\
      \ before they can be used again. As the player increases his weapons skill with\
      \ weapon ALMs, the more effective will the weapons be in damage.</p>\n<h4><span\

      \ - The player finds out that the tunnel from where he is at, the spaceport,\
      \ to Athena's commercial district has been sabotaged and blocked. He is allowed\
      \ the use of an old tunnel boring vehicle to unblock the tunnel. On the way\
      \ to unblock the tunnel, the player will be met with some resistance from R.A.M.\
      \ One of the resistors will have a rocket launcher, which could disable the\
      \ vehicle. If this resistor is killed, the player can loot an explosive ALM\

      \ will give information to the player on how to contact a person in a shady\
      \ part of the commercial district who has information on how to infiltrate the\
      \ resistance group to find out who is the leader of the resistance movement.\
      \ Once the player finds this person, he will have to perform a small mission\
      \ to win this person's trust. Once this is done, this person will give the information\
      \ on how to infiltrate R.A.M and will offer the player to purchase an infiltration\
      \ ALM with a disguise kit, a weapons upgrade ALM, different types of weapons,\

      \ sneaking in or by force. The leader, when found, will not trust the player\
      \ if the player uses too much force and will escape.. If the player finds the\
      \ leader without much force, the leader of the resistance movement will try\
      \ to win the player over to his side. If the player chooses to side with the\
      \ resistance, the leader will give the player his next mission. If not, the\
      \ leader will escape.</p>\n<p><b>Athena Police Station</b> - If the player is\
      \ now helping the resistance, his mission will be to release a R.A.M. member\
      \ who is held by the police. If the player is still helping the Athena police,\
      \ his mission is to go back to the station to report on what he found out about\
      \ the leader of the resistance movement. In this case, the player will still\
      \ meet with the prisoner who will also try to persuade the player into joining\
      \ the resistance. This will give the player another chance to change his course.\
      \ The player will also be given the information on what R.A.M. is planning on\
      \ next, which is to destroy the solar power plant to allow the them to try to\
      \ take over Athena's headquarters.</p>\n<p><b>Solar Power Generator</b> - If\
      \ the player is helping R.A.M., the player will be given the mission to destroy\
      \ a solar power generator, which is located outdoors with a Martian atmosphere.\
      \ In this case, there will be Athena policeman protecting the generator. If\
      \ the player is still aligned with the Athena Corporation, his mission will\
      \ be to help protect the solar power generator from R.A.M.</p>\n<p><b>Athena\
      \ HQ</b> - The player will either attack or defend the headquarters depending\
      \ on which side he is on.</p>\n<p><b>Boss</b> - After the raid on the headquarters,\
      \ the player will now have to fight against either the CEO of Athena or the\

    text: "===The Machine===\n\n====Design Treatment, Version 1.0====\n\n====April\
      \ 2003====\n\n----\n\n====Vacation Gone Bad====\n\n\"Here take this and stick\
      \ it up your nose,\" said a bloody man laying on the ship's floor.\n\nRussel\
      \ just stood there in confusion and wondering why he took a vacation to Mars.\
      \ \"What the hell is this guy talking about? Damn, my heads hurts. Who in the\
      \ hell hit me in the head? Why, oh why did I have to choose to go to Mars?,\"\
      \ Russel thought to himself.\n\n\"Hey, snap out of it! The pilot is dead and\
      \ YOU need to take control over the ship. So, take this from me.\"\n\nRussel\
      \ was even more confused now. \"I can't fly a ship. I'm just an insurance salesman.\
      \ I'm just trying to have a nice vacation. What do you mean the pilot is dead?\
      \ Oh my god, we are all going to die!\"\n\n\"Everybody else is already dead\
      \ and I'm not far behind. If you want to be able to survive and avoid a permanent\
      \ vacation, you need to take this from me and stick it up your nose.\"\n\n\"\
      What the hell are you talking about?\" asked Russel as he looked at something\
      \ with two prong-like attachments protruding from a hand-sized box-shaped device.\n\
      \n----\n\n====Basic Game Concept====\n\nThe Machine is an action/adventure role-playing\
      \ game in which the player finds himself as a character stuck on Mars right\
      \ in the mix of a confrontation between a Mars commercial/exploration corporation\
      \ named Athena and an underground resistance movement with the acronym R.A.M.\
      \ (Resistance Against the Machine). To get off Mars, the player must either\
      \ help out Athena to put an end to the resistance movement or help the resistance\
      \ movement topple the Athena Corporation.\n\n----\n\n====Series Structure and\
      \ Gameplay====\n\nThe player will go through eight missions. Depending on a\
      \ player's action, such as aligning with the resistance or with Athena, the\
      \ goal of some of the missions will change accordingly. \n\n====ALMs====\n\n\
      Since the player's character is just an insurance salesman, he needs help to\
      \ overcome the obstacles in his path to reach the goal of getting off Mars.\
      \ A new technology called Advanced Learning Modules (ALM's) will help him to\
      \ do this.\n\nALM's are devices that one can use by inserting the prongs of\
      \ the device into one's nostrils, which then the device locates a nerve stem\
      \ to the brain and then uploads or teaches the brain a new skill or other knowledge\
      \ that one would normally have to spend many days learning. The player will\
      \ either be given and/or have to find or purchase these ALM's throughout the\
      \ game. Skill related ALMs acquired by the player will always be an upgrade\
      \ if the player already has already acquired that skill. There are three skill\
      \ levels per ALM except for the vehicle ALM given to the player's character\
      \ in the opening movie sequence, which has only one. There is a limited amount\
      \ (ten) of ALM's that the player can be able to use before his brain goes into\
      \ overload. \n\nThe list of ALMs skills are vehicle, weapons, explosives, environmental\
      \ training, hacking, and infiltration.\n\n====Weapons====\n\nThe weapons in\
      \ the game will be mostly conventional weapons with a futuristic aspect to them.\
      \ The weapon list includes a blaster pistol, stun-gun, shotgun, sniper rifle,\
      \ assault rifle, and rocket launcher. The blaster pistol and stun-gun will be\
      \ the only weapons that will not need ammo, but they have a charge limit and\
      \ once that is reached they need to recharge before they can be used again.\
      \ As the player increases his weapons skill with weapon ALMs, the more effective\
      \ will the weapons be in damage.\n\n====Explosives====\n\nExplosives in the\
      \ game can be used to destroy targets in the game or used to clear certain types\
      \ of obstacles in the game. Explosives in the game will include C4-like explosives,\
      \ EMP grenades, and conventional-type grenades. The higher level the explosive\
      \ skill, the higher the effectiveness of the explosives.\n\n====Environmental\
      \ Training====\n\nSome parts of the game will have hazardous areas that will\
      \ require that the player use a hazard suit or compression suit to complete\
      \ his missions. To be able to use these suits, the player will need an environmental\
      \ training skill. The higher the skill, the longer the player can use the suits.\
      \ For hazardous areas, such as rooms filled with gas or fire, the higher the\
      \ skill will lessen the damage taken by the player while using a hazard suit.\n\
      \n====Hacking====\n\nSome areas in the game will be secured by electronic security\
      \ equipment in which can be bypassed if the player has a skilll in hacking.\
      \ There is a chance that the player can fail in hacking a system and the failure\
      \ rate is determined by the player's skill in hacking. The higher the skill,\
      \ the less chance of failure.\n\n====Infiltration====\n\nFor the player to be\
      \ quieter and avoid being seen and heard, the infiltration skill can give the\
      \ player an option other than brute force to help complete his missions. This\
      \ skill will also allow the player to use a disguise kit and uniforms from NPC's\
      \ to infiltrate an enemy's base. The higher the infiltration skill, the easier\
      \ it is to avoid detection from enemies.\n\n====The Missions====\n\n'''Training'''\
      \ - When the player's character first arrives at Mars, he will be informed of\
      \ the situation between R.A.M and the Athena Corporation, which will explain\
      \ why he was hit on the head and everybody on board the ship were killed. He\
      \ then will be told that he can't leave Mars until the situation is under control.\
      \ For his own safety, he will be given a blaster pistol and a weapons ALM, and\
      \ the opportunity to test his new skill. This will allow the player to get used\
      \ to the controls and the interface.\n\n'''Tunnel''' - The player finds out\
      \ that the tunnel from where he is at, the spaceport, to Athena's commercial\
      \ district has been sabotaged and blocked. He is allowed the use of an old tunnel\
      \ boring vehicle to unblock the tunnel. On the way to unblock the tunnel, the\
      \ player will be met with some resistance from R.A.M. One of the resistors will\
      \ have a rocket launcher, which could disable the vehicle. If this resistor\
      \ is killed, the player can loot an explosive ALM from the resistor, which will\
      \ allow the player to be able to still clear the tunnel.\n\n'''Commercial District'''\
      \ - After the player unblocks the tunnel, the player will be met by Athena's\
      \ police chief. The police chief will give information to the player on how\
      \ to contact a person in a shady part of the commercial district who has information\
      \ on how to infiltrate the resistance group to find out who is the leader of\
      \ the resistance movement. Once the player finds this person, he will have to\
      \ perform a small mission to win this person's trust. Once this is done, this\
      \ person will give the information on how to infiltrate R.A.M and will offer\
      \ the player to purchase an infiltration ALM with a disguise kit, a weapons\
      \ upgrade ALM, different types of weapons, and ammo.\n\n'''R.A.M. Infiltration'''\
      \ - To find out who the leader of the resistance movement is, the player will\
      \ try to infiltrate R.A.M by sneaking in or by force. The leader, when found,\
      \ will not trust the player if the player uses too much force and will escape..\
      \ If the player finds the leader without much force, the leader of the resistance\
      \ movement will try to win the player over to his side. If the player chooses\
      \ to side with the resistance, the leader will give the player his next mission.\
      \ If not, the leader will escape.\n\n'''Athena Police Station''' - If the player\
      \ is now helping the resistance, his mission will be to release a R.A.M. member\
      \ who is held by the police. If the player is still helping the Athena police,\
      \ his mission is to go back to the station to report on what he found out about\
      \ the leader of the resistance movement. In this case, the player will still\
      \ meet with the prisoner who will also try to persuade the player into joining\
      \ the resistance. This will give the player another chance to change his course.\
      \ The player will also be given the information on what R.A.M. is planning on\
      \ next, which is to destroy the solar power plant to allow the them to try to\
      \ take over Athena's headquarters.\n\n'''Solar Power Generator''' - If the player\
      \ is helping R.A.M., the player will be given the mission to destroy a solar\
      \ power generator, which is located outdoors with a Martian atmosphere. In this\
      \ case, there will be Athena policeman protecting the generator. If the player\
      \ is still aligned with the Athena Corporation, his mission will be to help\
      \ protect the solar power generator from R.A.M.\n\n'''Athena HQ''' - The player\
      \ will either attack or defend the headquarters depending on which side he is\
      \ on.\n\n'''Boss''' - After the raid on the headquarters, the player will now\
      \ have to fight against either the CEO of Athena or the leader of R.A.M. to\
      \ be able to finally get off Mars and end the game.\n\n----\n\n====Cast of Characters====\n\
      \n'''Russel Paddock''' - This is the character that the player gets to play.\
      \ Russ is an insurance salesman by trade and doesn't have the look of someone\
      \ that could be a hero. His goal was to have a relaxing vacation on Mars before\
      \ he was caught up in the conflict between R.A.M. and then Athena Corporation.\n\
      \n'''Peter Nelsen''' - Peter is the dying man on the same spaceship that Russel\
      \ was on, which was hi-jacked by R.A.M. members. Peter was on his way back from\
      \ a meeting on Earth with a company who has an interest in Athena's new technology,\
      \ ALMs.\n\n'''Paul Brocklesby''' - Paul is the spaceport officer who debriefs\
      \ Russel about the situation on Mars. Paul is also responsible for the training\
      \ mission if the player needs it to get used to the controls and interface of\
      \ the game.\n\n'''Chief Officer Lansky''' - No one calls ''the Chief'' by his\
      \ first name. The player will meet Officer Lansky after clearing the tunnel.\n\
      \n'''Jake Nixon''' - Jake is the person that Russel searches to find out more\
      \ information on R.A.M. Jake is an arms dealer by trade and a purveyor of stolen\
      \ goods for fun.\n\n'''William Emerson''' - Will is the resistance member being\
      \ held by the Athena police. He is very loyal to the resistance movement but\
      \ talks a little too much, which allows the police to know beforehand some of\
      \ the events planned by R.A.M. \n\n'''Juan De Gauss''' - John, as his friends\
      \ call him, is the leader of the resistance movement. He fears that Athena is\
      \ using the new technology of ALMs to manipulate and control people.\n\n'''Alexander\
      \ Olsen''' - Alex is the CEO of Athena Corporation. Alex is responsible for\
      \ the building of Athena. He is the Machine.\n\n----\n\n====Look and Feel====\n\
      \nThe Machine will be in first person and will use a graphics engine suitable\
      \ to first person shooters, the Unreal Engine. This will be a mod of an existent\
      \ game, Unreal 2. The levels will have the look and feel of scenes from movies\
      \ such as Blade Runner, Johnny Mnuemonic, Nick Fury, Total Recall, and other\
      \ sci-fi and cyberpunk movies. Inventory, skill, and NPC conversation interface\
      \ will be similar to that of Deus Ex.\n\n----\n\n====Target Audience====\n\n\
      This game will be suited for people who are interested in mods which extend\
      \ the gameplay for Unreal 2. This will also be a game for those who like cyberpunk\
      \ environments and games, such as Deus Ex.\n\n----\n\nOriginal Document written\
