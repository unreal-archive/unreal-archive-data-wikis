      <p>While the race is a free-for-all to the finish, it actually counts on the\

      <p>Everyone either drives the Hoversled or the Hoverboard (player chooses which).</p>\n\
      <p>The Hoverboard is the faster of the two vehicles, but has no/very little\
      \ armor and worse steering. It is the only vehicle that can pull off stunts\
      \ other than flips, and it can also jump higher.</p>\n<p>The Hoversled is the\
      \ slower of the two vehicles, but has good armor and good handling. It is the\
      \ only vehicle that can smash straight through static meshes (or if thats not\
      \ possible, normal decorations). It handles landings slightly better too, but\
      \ cannot pull off any stunts other than flips.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ be snow only, due to the fact that the vehicles hover, so you could have levels\
      \ through a desert, down a long sunny stretch of grass, or even through very\
      \ odd settings like the titanic, winding city streets, through the corridors\
      \ of an ancient pyramid/temple, or some srange spaceship.</p>\n<p>There would\
      \ be a training level of course, with gates to stop you to explain the next\
      \ area before setting the vehicle off again, showing the basic features of the\
      \ game.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Terrain\">The Terrain</span><span\

      \ The Terrain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n\
      <p><b>Start Line</b>: An area of green textured ground where all the players\
      \ spawn. There can only be one though.</p>\n<p><b>Guidance fences</b>: Come\
      \ in 3 variations. The orange plastic stuff you get at the winter olympics,\
      \ red forcefield beams, or a style of your choosing! These are simply walls\
      \ which instead of crashing your vehicle, turn it towards the centre of the\
      \ track. Found in the tutorial level for aiming your vehicle at the pause gates.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Pause gates</b>: Blue boxes with a metal gate between them. Your vehicle\
      \ pauses here in the tutorial mission to explain the next area. Could be found\
      \ in other levels as an obsticle. Pause time varies according to what the level\
      \ author chooses.</p>\n<p><b>Kickers</b>: Your standard jump pads, probably\
      \ for catching items in the air, or bouncing over walls into shortcuts or super\
      \ weapons.</p>\n<p><b>Jump ramps</b>: Handily marked in big blue (or red) letters\
      \ saying the word JUMP, these are where you cut a second or two off your total\
      \ time to give you the edge (and maybe even win the race). They can come in\
      \ any shape colour or size, and my even be hidden down some shortcuts.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Red Inventory Boxes</b>: These give you basic weapons, such as missiles\
      \ or mines, one of the most common types of boxes.</p>\n<p><b>Yellow Inventory\
      \ Crates</b>: These give you basic power-ups, such as speed boost or 1.5x damage,\
      \ the other most common type of box.</p>\n<p><b>Ghostly Inventory Crates</b>:\
      \ These give you power-ups only for the Hoverboard, such as higher jumping,\
      \ and faster stunts.</p>\n<p><b>Steel Inventory Crates</b>: These give you power-ups\
      \ only for the Hoversled, such as power ram or cutters.</p>\n<p><b>Blue Inventory\
      \ Crates</b>: w00t! these give you the super weapons, such as the redeemer,\
      \ or the leader-seeker. Super rare.</p>\n<p><b>Green Inventory Crates</b>:w00t!\
      \ these give you the super power-ups, such as invincibility or quad damage.\
      \ Super rare.</p>\n<p><b>Gold inventory crates</b>: These drop your total time\
      \ by about 5 seconds. Quite rare.</p>\n<p><b>Teleports</b>: Your standard one\
      \ way portal. Often used where you cant bounce over or break through something,\
      \ or used at the end of a secret area to keep the location disclosed.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Trees/Cars/Logs/Statues/Low Walls</b>: These block the Hoverboard, but\
      \ can be broken by a Hoversled.</p>\n<p><b>Trains</b>: Watch out! These things\
      \ can really ruin your day, because touching them –&gt; fragged. Just look for\
      \ the flashing red lights that tell you when the train's about to hit. Some\
      \ other trains are so long, theyre there for the whole race, so use the nearby\
      \ ramps!</p>\n<p><b>Stop Watches</b>: Pause your time for about 1.5 seconds.\
      \ Very useful, but rare.</p>\n<p><b>Water</b>: Yo7ur vehicles float above water\
      \ like it were solid ground, but if you fall into it from a height, you sink\
      \ through, allowing you to land from very high up unharmed.</p>\n<p><b>Finish\
      \ line</b>: Signified by the classic chequered area on the floor, these are\
      \ where the race ends, but there are also three special varients of the finish\
      \ line.</p>\n<p><b>Floating finish line:</b> signified by a floating chequered\
      \ pattern portal in mid air, these are usually found floating over the normal\
      \ finish, and give half a second off your finish time.</p>\n<p><b>Distance finish\
      \ line</b>: similar to both the Normal finish and the floating finish. these\
      \ are on the floor, but you have to jump into them, the further you jump into\
      \ them, the more half-seconds are taken off your time. The zones are usually\
      \ signified by diferent backround colours in the chequered area.</p>\n<p><b>Super\
      \ secret secret finish</b>: these take two seconds off your time, but are ultra\
      \ rare, and found in secret areas near the end of the run.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p><b>Missiles</b>: These are your run of the mill projectiles.\
      \ Most abundant weapon in the game. Fire shoots one missile forward. Alt fire\
      \ attaches two missiles to the sides of your vehicles for a mini speed boost.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Homing missiles</b>: Same as the regular missiles, but with a bit more\
      \ of a kick, and home in on the player in front. Fire launches one homing missile\
      \ forwards. Alt fire is exactly the same as that of the regular misiles, but\
      \ forces the player on a collision course with the player in front.</p>\n<p><b>Mines</b>:\
      \ Drop and forget. these are a nice welcome gift for the people behind you.\
      \ Fire drops a mine which hovers just above the usual height of the vehicles.\
      \ Alt fire drops a mine that rolls slowly downhill until it hits a wall, or\
      \ hits a vehicle.</p>\n<p><b>Amp mines</b>: Nice and explosive, other than that,\
      \ they are exactly the same as normal mines.</p>\n<p><b>EMP Mines</b>: Blue\
      \ and glowy. Same fire modes as the other mines, but when they hit a person,\
      \ they explode with an EMP, shutting off the anti-grav thingys in the vehicles\
      \ for 2.5 seconds.</p>\n<p><b>Machine Guns</b>: This is really just the assult\
      \ rifle.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Super_Weapons\">Super Weapons</span><span\

      \ Teh insta gib rifle! do i need to say more?</p>\n<p><b>Mini-gun</b>: Machine\

      \ ever messed around with the ChaosUT super weapons and came across the vortex\
      \ launcher\\? this could be a less buggy vesion of that. Fire launches a black\
      \ hole missile, which upon impact, sucks in all nearby players. Alt fire drops\

      \ No, mines dont affect the person who dropped them</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>\
      \ k.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> Have a cool effect with the cutters! You should\
      \ have the cutters get damaged until it falls off.</p>\n<p><b>Icedude:</b> I\
      \ got it! The staticmeshes that the hoversled can ram out of the way could be\
      \ KActors, so instead of them being destroyed, they just get knocked out of\
      \ the way!</p>\n<p><b>Icedude:</b> If you want to see what i mean, rent Sonic\
      \ Adventure 2 Battle for the Gamecube (of you dont already own it) and play\
      \ the first level for the heros, you'll see what i was thinking of</p>\n<p><b>ProjectX:</b>\
      \ This looks cool, can't wait to see it, btw, the obvious tricks would be 360\
      \ degree turns, etc. and a mixture between a flip and a turn, you could have\
      \ a sort of kick flip thing, i dunno, these are just brief ideas</p>\n<p><b>Icedude:</b>\
      \ Maybe turning could be doneby turning the camear at the normal speed, and\
      \ then the player turning around to face the same way as the camera (like in\
      \ AirfightUT)</p>\n<p><b>Piglet:</b> Sounds a little like the hover race mod\
      \ for Q1, could be cool but with a huge specification like that it's unlikely\
      \ it will ever truly be made (sad but true) that said a simmilar but simpler\
      \ mod along simmilar ideas may be more possible (say a hoverboard mutator or\
      \ something)</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> Turning should be if you press a strafe\
      \ key, it fires a revse thruster to the respective side, so for breaking you\
      \ press both sides at once! that would be totally badass</p>\n<p><b>Doodle77:</b>\
      \ Awesome idea, you might want to add a less crazy speed powerup type thing\
      \ like in CarBall. also maybye an invisbilty powerup. you cant forget rolling\
      \ as a trick , that could be done in a hoversled. would it always be downhill\
      \ or would there be flat areas? how bout gravity mines, lay them after jumps\
      \ and people just get pulled down so they cant do tricks.</p>\n<p><b>amitakartok:</b>\
      \ How cool it would be if there were a superweapon which fires a rope-like energy\
      \ barrier onto two enemies in front of you, ramming them into each other? Or\
      \ giving you a speed boost (like the grappling hook in Lego Racers [hit enemy\
      \ in front of you, he will stop and give his speed to you])?</p>\n<hr />\n<!--\

    text: "DownhillUT - Bobsleing and Snowboarding meets Back To The Future meets\
      \ Super Mario Kart meets UT2k3\n\n==Description==\n\nWARNING! Extensive description!\
      \ Long Read!\n\n====Basic Idea ====\n\nEveryone races down a mountain to be\
      \ first to the bottom... while blowing each other up... on hoverboards or in\
      \ small one man hovering bobsleds.\n\n====Scoring ====\n\nWhile the race is\
      \ a free-for-all to the finish, it actually counts on the best time.  You can\
      \ cut 2 seconds from your time by fragging somebody, and you can cut more off\
      \ with stunts of different dificulty. Beng fragged will not add any time to\
      \ your score, but will set you down in the same spot 2 seconds after you die.\n\
      \n====Vehicles ====\n\nEveryone either drives the Hoversled or the Hoverboard\
      \ (player chooses which).\n\nThe Hoverboard is the faster of the two vehicles,\
      \ but has no/very little armor and worse steering.  It is the only vehicle that\
      \ can pull off stunts other than flips, and it can also jump higher.\n\nThe\
      \ Hoversled is the slower of the two vehicles, but has good armor and good handling.\
      \  It is the only vehicle that can smash straight through static meshes (or\
      \ if thats not possible, normal decorations). It handles landings slightly better\
      \ too, but cannot pull off any stunts other than flips.\n\n====Controls ====\n\
      \nUp = Mini boosters. Used on level ground to get some momentum.\n\nDown = Reverse\
      \ mini boosters. Also known as brakes.\n\nStrafe Left = Turn left\n\nStrafe\
      \ Right = Turn right\n\nCrouch = Activate currently selected powerup\n\nFire\
      \ = Fires your weapon\n\nAlt fire = Fires your weapon in alternate fire mode\n\
      \nJump = Jump (duh)\n\nWeapon Up = Next Powerup\n\nWeapon Down = Previous powerup\n\
      \n====The Levels ====\n\nAll the levels are downhill ones, but dont have to\
      \ be snow only, due to the fact that the vehicles hover, so you could have levels\
      \ through a desert, down a long sunny stretch of grass, or even through very\
      \ odd settings like the titanic, winding city streets, through the corridors\
      \ of an ancient pyramid/temple, or some srange spaceship.\n\nThere would be\
      \ a training level of course, with gates to stop you to explain the next area\
      \ before setting the vehicle off again, showing the basic features of the game.\n\
      \n====The Terrain ====\n\n'''Start Line''': An area of green textured ground\
      \ where all the players spawn.  There can only be one though.\n\n'''Guidance\
      \ fences''': Come in 3 variations. The orange plastic stuff you get at the winter\
      \ olympics, red forcefield beams, or a style of your choosing!  These are simply\
      \ walls which instead of crashing your vehicle, turn it towards the centre of\
      \ the track. Found in the tutorial level for aiming your vehicle at the pause\
      \ gates.\n\n'''Pause gates''': Blue boxes with a metal gate between them. Your\
      \ vehicle pauses here in the tutorial mission to explain the next area. Could\
      \ be found in other levels as an obsticle. Pause time varies according to what\
      \ the level author chooses.\n\n'''Kickers''': Your standard jump pads, probably\
      \ for catching items in the air, or bouncing over walls into shortcuts or super\
      \ weapons.\n\n'''Jump ramps''': Handily marked in big blue (or red) letters\
      \ saying the word JUMP, these are where you cut a second or two off your total\
      \ time to give you the edge (and maybe even win the race). They can come in\
      \ any shape colour or size, and my even be hidden down some shortcuts.\n\n'''Red\
      \ Inventory Boxes''': These give you basic weapons, such as missiles or mines,\
      \ one of the most common types of boxes.\n\n'''Yellow Inventory Crates''': These\
      \ give you basic power-ups, such as speed boost or 1.5x damage, the other most\
      \ common type of box.\n\n'''Ghostly Inventory Crates''': These give you power-ups\
      \ only for the Hoverboard, such as higher jumping, and faster stunts.\n\n'''Steel\
      \ Inventory Crates''': These give you power-ups only for the Hoversled, such\
      \ as power ram or cutters.\n\n'''Blue Inventory Crates''': w00t! these give\
      \ you the super weapons, such as the redeemer, or the leader-seeker. Super rare.\n\
      \n'''Green Inventory Crates''':w00t! these give you the super power-ups, such\
      \ as invincibility or quad damage. Super rare.\n\n'''Gold inventory crates''':\
      \ These drop your total time by about 5 seconds. Quite rare.\n\n'''Teleports''':\
      \ Your standard one way portal. Often used where you cant bounce over or break\
      \ through something, or used at the end of a secret area to keep the location\
      \ disclosed.\n\n'''Trees/Cars/Logs/Statues/Low Walls''': These block the Hoverboard,\
      \ but can be broken by a Hoversled.\n\n'''Trains''': Watch out! These things\
      \ can really ruin your day, because touching them &ndash;> fragged. Just look\
      \ for the flashing red lights that tell you when the train's about to hit. Some\
      \ other trains are so long, theyre there for the whole race, so use the nearby\
      \ ramps!\n\n'''Stop Watches''': Pause your time for about 1.5 seconds. Very\
      \ useful, but rare.\n\n'''Water''': Yo7ur vehicles float above water like it\
      \ were solid ground, but if you fall into it from a height, you sink through,\
      \ allowing you to land from very high up unharmed.\n\n'''Finish line''': Signified\
      \ by the classic chequered area on the floor, these are where the race ends,\
      \ but there are also three special varients of the finish line.\n\n'''Floating\
      \ finish line:''' signified by a floating chequered pattern portal in mid air,\
      \ these are usually found floating over the normal finish, and give half a second\
      \ off your finish time.\n\n'''Distance finish line''': similar to both the Normal\
      \ finish and the floating finish. these are on the floor, but you have to jump\
      \ into them, the further you jump into them, the more half-seconds are taken\
      \ off your time. The zones are usually signified by diferent backround colours\
      \ in the chequered area.\n\n'''Super secret secret finish''': these take two\
      \ seconds off your time, but are ultra rare, and found in secret areas near\
      \ the end of the run.\n\n====Weapons ====\n\n'''Missiles''': These are your\
      \ run of the mill projectiles. Most abundant weapon in the game. Fire shoots\
      \ one missile forward. Alt fire attaches two missiles to the sides of your vehicles\
      \ for a mini speed boost.\n\n'''Homing missiles''': Same as the regular missiles,\
      \ but with a bit more of a kick, and home in on the player in front. Fire launches\
      \ one homing missile forwards. Alt fire is exactly the same as that of the regular\
      \ misiles, but forces the player on a collision course with the player in front.\n\
      \n'''Mines''': Drop and forget. these are a nice welcome gift for the people\
      \ behind you. Fire drops a mine which hovers just above the usual height of\
      \ the vehicles. Alt fire drops a mine that rolls slowly downhill until it hits\
      \ a wall, or hits a vehicle.\n\n'''Amp mines''': Nice and explosive, other than\
      \ that, they are exactly the same as normal mines.\n\n'''EMP Mines''': Blue\
      \ and glowy. Same fire modes as the other mines, but when they hit a person,\
      \ they explode with an EMP, shutting off the anti-grav thingys in the vehicles\
      \ for 2.5 seconds.\n\n'''Machine Guns''': This is really just the assult rifle.\n\
      \n====Super Weapons ====\n\n'''Teh 'deemer''': TEH 'DEMER! do i need to say\
      \ any more?\n\n'''Leader Seeker''': An instant frag missile that seeks out the\
      \ leader in both fire modes. Unfortunately, if you are the leader, its a suicide\
      \ weapon.\n\n'''Insta-gib''': Teh insta gib rifle! do i need to say more?\n\n\
      '''Mini-gun''': Machine guns but twice as powerfull.\n\n'''Black hole launcher''':\
      \ have you ever messed around with the ChaosUT super weapons and came across\
      \ the vortex launcher\\? this could be a less buggy vesion of that. Fire launches\
      \ a black hole missile, which upon impact, sucks in all nearby players. Alt\
      \ fire drops a black hole mine.\n\n====Power-ups ====\n\n'''1.5x damage''':\
      \ Multiplies the damage by 1.5. pretty nifty if you need to finish of someone\
      \ further ahead. instant effect\n\n'''Speed boost''': Doubles your speed for\
      \ 5 seconds. perfect for getting that extra bit of free time from a distance\
      \ finish. trigger when you want\n\n'''Force field''': Gives you 75 armour, instant\
      \ effect.\n\n'''Translocator''': The translocator, one shot only.\n\n====Super\
      \ Power-ups ====\n\n'''Invincibility''': Invincibility for 30 seconds. Instant\
      \ effect.\n\n'''Quad Damage''': Multiplies damage by 4. Instant effect.\n\n\
      '''NoS boost''': Quadruples speed for 5 seconds. Trigger when you want.\n\n\
      '''Teleport Rifle''': Instagib rifle except teleports you to the location of\
      \ where it hit, one shot only\n\n====Hoversled Only Power-ups ====\n\n'''Power\
      \ Ram''': Gives you the power to ram through anything destructible (including\
      \ players) without loosing speed for 10 seconds. Instant effect.\n\n'''Cutters''':\
      \ Adds razor blades to the sides of the Hoversled, allowing you to cause damage\
      \ to players if you bump into them from the side. Stays on for 4 bumps. Instant\
      \ effect.\n\n'''Streamlining''': Replaces the current shell of the Hoversled\
      \ with a more streamlined version, incrasing your maximum speed. Lasts until\
      \ the end of the race. Instant effect.\n\n====Hoverboard Only Power-Ups ====\n\
      \n'''Power hopper''': Launches high pressure jets of air below the board, increasing\
      \ jump height. Lasts for 3 jumps. Instant effect.\n\n'''Improved control jets''':\
      \ Launches high pressure jets of air from the board in all directions allowing\
      \ faster stunts. Lasts for one jump. Instant Effect.\n\n'''Spin jets''': Launches\
      \ high pressure jets of air from the front nd aft sides of he board, allowing\
      \ improved turning. Lasts until the race ends. Instant Effect.\n\n====Stunts\
      \ ====\n\n'''Forward Flip''': Makes your vehicle flip over forwards in mid air.\
      \ Both Vehicles. Takes 2 seconds off your time.\n\n'''Back Flip''': Makes your\
      \ vehicle flip over backwards in mid air. Both Vehicles. Takes 2 seconds off\
      \ your time.\n\nUmm. Cant think of any more tricks. If anyone has that Tony\
      \ Hawk's like snowboarding game, can they mail me some of the tricks and what\
      \ they do?\n\n====Misc. Notes ====\n\nAll the weapons (except the machine gun)\
      \ have a maximum one round.\n\nThe Machine Gun can fire for 5 seconds after\
      \ the first bullet is fired\n\nYou can only hold one weapon at a time.\n\nInventory\
      \ crates respawn 0.25 seconds after they are collected\n\nLevels would be able\
      \ to have more than one finishing area, and dont have to be in a straight line\
      \ (un like most snowboarding games, which always have straight down tracks with\
      \ minor turns.\n\nBy walls, any slope over 45 dgrees up from the current surface\
      \ counts as a wall. 45 degrees or under counts as floor, so you could make loops\
      \ and halfpipes.\n\n----\n\n==Interested Scripters==\n\nIcedude (well, i'd be\
      \ more of a mapper, cause i cant code to save my life)\n\nDarkwarrior (Might\
      \ be able to make some of the weapons)\n\n----\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:'''\
      \ WOW! This will be really cool! I look foreward to playing this mod!\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:'''\
      \ When the emp mines blows up, does it shut of the anit-grav things on the person\
      \ who planted the bomb?\n\n'''Icedude:''' No, mines dont affect the person who\
      \ dropped them\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' k.\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Have a cool effect\
      \ with the cutters! You should have the cutters get damaged until it falls off.\n\
      \n'''Icedude:''' I got it! The staticmeshes that the hoversled can ram out of\
      \ the way could be KActors, so instead of them being destroyed, they just get\
      \ knocked out of the way!\n\n'''Icedude:''' If you want to see what i mean,\
      \ rent Sonic Adventure 2 Battle for the Gamecube (of you dont already own it)\
      \ and play the first level for the heros, you'll see what i was thinking of\n\
      \n'''ProjectX:''' This looks cool, can't wait to see it, btw, the obvious tricks\
      \ would be 360 degree turns, etc. and a mixture between a flip and a turn, you\
      \ could have a sort of kick flip thing, i dunno, these are just brief ideas\n\
      \n'''Icedude:''' Maybe turning could be doneby turning the camear at the normal\
      \ speed, and then the player turning around to face the same way as the camera\
      \ (like in AirfightUT)\n\n'''Piglet:''' Sounds a little like the hover race\
      \ mod for Q1, could be cool but with a huge specification like that it's unlikely\
      \ it will ever truly be made (sad but true) that said a simmilar but simpler\
      \ mod along simmilar ideas may be more possible (say a hoverboard mutator or\
      \ something)\n\n'''Mosquito:''' Turning should be if you press a strafe key,\
      \ it fires a revse thruster to the respective side, so for breaking you press\
      \ both sides at once! that would be totally badass\n\n'''Doodle77:''' Awesome\
      \ idea, you might want to add a less crazy speed powerup type thing like in\
      \ CarBall. also maybye an invisbilty powerup. you cant forget rolling as a trick\
      \ , that could be done in a hoversled. would it always be downhill or would\
      \ there be flat areas? how bout gravity mines, lay them after jumps and people\
      \ just get pulled down so they cant do tricks.\n\n'''amitakartok:''' How cool\
      \ it would be if there were a superweapon which fires a rope-like energy barrier\
      \ onto two enemies in front of you, ramming them into each other? Or giving\
      \ you a speed boost (like the grappling hook in Lego Racers [hit enemy in front\
      \ of you, he will stop and give his speed to you])?\n\n----"
