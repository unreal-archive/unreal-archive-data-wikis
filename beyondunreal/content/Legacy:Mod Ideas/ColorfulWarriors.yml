      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Hi, this is K_St_theJunior. I have just completed\
      \ a umod SkinPack consisting of most of my \"Colorful Warriors\" skins (25 so\
      \ far, v.2, with 4 never yet appearing at SkinCity), and it's already about\
      \ 23 mb of stuff. It includes my GreenNali and WhiteNali skins, and even a \"\
      GreenNaliGiants\" mutator that I've almost got right. If Atif Riaz (\"eagleAR\"\
      ) is able to finish fixing it for me, I'll be posting this through SkinCity\
      \ as a gigantic SkinPack in just a couple more days. (If he can't get it fixed\
      \ for me, I may have to request help on that aspect from other coders.) Ralf\
      \ at SkinCity in Germany has already sent me an e-mail indicating that he will\
      \ be happy to post the gigantic ColorfulWarriors SkinPack for us, so this new\
      \ mod I've envisioned already has a potential publisher at BeyondUnreal.com,\
      \ I believe.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I am visualizing the possibility of turning it\
      \ into a mini-mod with the addition of my little mutator – plus some flying\
      \ vehicles, if someone volunteers to help! If some talented volunteer coder\
      \ could assist me with the transformation, I'd like to also add one \"floating\
      \ airboat\" model to it – or better still, SEVERAL \"airboats\" of various sizes,\
      \ ranging from small to larger. The smaller size would carry a player and maybe\
      \ one bot aboard, visible in third-person view (via hotkey) with ChaosUT swords\
      \ drawn and ready, or with ray-guns unholstered, letting them travel through\
      \ the air, around any map, and attack from above whenever they come zooming\
      \ down or jump off the airboat. The larger of the \"floating airboats\" (like\
      \ big floating rafts or rowboats, but much more modern/futuristic in appearance)\
      \ could hold maybe 5-10 players/bots aboard, all visible standing on the deck\
      \ of the airboat with swords/ray-guns drawn and ready for action.</p>\n<p>People\
      \ seem to have a lot of fun using the Strangelove mutator to fly around, and\
      \ the Quantum Fighter Jets mutator of Zencoder likewise, and they like the \"\
      Mobile Forces\" idea of moving vehicles within UT. So I think this could be\
      \ a lot of fun in a similar way, allowing fans to recreate the old \"pioneer\
      \ s-f\" of the earliest s-f literature.</p>\n<p>If Zencoder or anyone else would\
      \ be interested in working on this for me (as volunteer work, for free) and\
      \ sharing the credit, please contact me and let me know. This will be a free-giveaway\
      \ mod, and I'm poorer than dirt right now, so your only real payment would be\
      \ in appreciation from me and other UT fans. But let me know if you could help!</p>\n\
      <p>Anyone who submits a suitable-looking \"floating airboat\" mutator to me\
      \ will be considered for inclusion within the future versions of the Colorful\
      \ Warriors SkinPack/Mod, and I would be really happy to be able to include such\
      \ flying vehicles within future versions of the umod. If you want some hints\
      \ or pictures revealing more about what kind of appearance I'm aiming for in\
      \ the desired airboats, I can send you that upon request.</p>\n<p>Thanks in\
      \ advance for any help that any coders or modelers out there might be able to\
      \ provide.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>K_St_theJunior Aug. 2, 2002</p>\n<h4><span\

      \ \"GreenNaliGiants,\" \"GreenNaliGiants2x,\" \"GreenNaliGiants3x,\" and \"\
      GreenNaliGiants4x.\" What it does basically is just to increase the size of\
      \ all the Red Team bots while leaving all the Blue Team (and Green and Gold\
      \ Teams) at normal size. By choosing only my GreenNali (or WhiteNali for that\
      \ matter) skins in the Bot Selection window for all of the Red Team members,\
      \ it lets you see Giant GreenNalis at 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x size. I'm a librarian,\
      \ not a coder, but by playing around (– is 10-20 hours of frustrating and unsuccessful\
      \ labor \"playing around\"?) with various substitutions, I finally got it half-working.\
      \ At first, in my \"alpha 1\" version, the giants were sinking into the ground\
      \ because I didn't know the right code terms for setting the collision stuff.\
      \ Later, after another day's work, I contrived a new version (\"alpha 2\") that\
      \ got the Giants working just fine; only problem is that the normal-size Blue\
      \ Team members now float about 24 inches off the ground. That's what I've asked\
      \ eagleAR to fix for me (since he's helped me once before with my Runebot skins),\
      \ but he's not gotten back to me about it yet. EagleAR is Atif Riaz, by the\
      \ way, and he's the ingenius fellow who created the Runebots mutator – when\
      \ Human Head Studios execs kept insisting that it was just too difficult to\
      \ make any bots for Rune! Personally, I think he did a pretty darn good job\
      \ of it!</p>\n<p><b>K_St_theJunior (update):</b> The Colorful Warriors SkinPack\
      \ mod (v2.0) is currently available for download from SkinCity and the BeyondUnreal\

      \ inside it, and it is 24.3 MB in size at the present time. I have the GreenNaliGiants\
      \ mutators working correctly now, thanks to an assist from Atif Riaz. There\
      \ are 16 mutators included in the Pack, which allow Giant GreenNalis of 4 different\
      \ sizes (up to 400% of normal size) to be placed on either the Blue Team, Red\

      doable.\" I'm no UScript coder though. I'd never much thought of the prospects\
      \ of having bigger/smaller players. Would you make it so the player's view changes?\
      \ Obviously a larger player would have a slightly different view than a smaller\
      \ one would.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Just seen the new iterm on this on BU.\

      \ The bot-size mutator for teams (GreenNaliGiants) seems to be working fine\
      \ now, so far as I know. My two sons and I have used it mostly with bots, where\
      \ we usually put all the giants on the Red Team. As I recall, when you try playing\
      \ as a character on the Red Team (with the Red Team GNG size mutator engaged,\
      \ together with the right Xbots list), YOU DO GET the higher viewpoint of the\
      \ giant character, in First Person view, and if you switch to Third Person view,\
      \ you likewise see a giant version of your character. That part's already done,\
      \ though. I hope what you were trying to suggest is that the Floating Airboats\
      \ idea is \"doable,\" because I'm still trying to find some bright volunteer\
      \ to invent/design that for the CW Mod.</p>\n<p><b>K_St_theJunior (to Tarquin):</b>\
      \ I'm happy that the CW v3.0 Mod is starting to come together. It should include\
      \ a few customized maps made by SabbathCat and Luggage, but I hope to find some\

      \ thread under \"Models\" called \"Floating Airboats Needed For CW Mod,\" but\
      \ so far no modeller/coder has jumped on board with a willingness to make the\
