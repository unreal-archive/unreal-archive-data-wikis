      <p>(if you have the game, you can skim past the obvious points to paragraph\
      \ 3 where all the UT2k3 version stuff comes in)</p>\n<p>This mod would quite\
      \ simply be a multiplayer version of Super Mario Sunshine, but with Juggernaughts,\
      \ Robots and Anubians. The idea is simple, each player has a powerfull multi-purpose\
      \ backpack mounted water cannon, which, along with the usual spray forward,\
      \ can do 3 other unique things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With the hover nozzle allows\
      \ you to hover in the air for 3 seconds while shooting water downwatds</li>\n\
      <li>The Boost nozzle forces you to run 5 times as fast while you hold down fire\
      \ untill you run out of water</li>\n<li>The rocket nozzle charges, then launches\
      \ you uber-high into the air</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The aim of the game is simple,\
      \ it is played out in eight rounds, and in each one you have one goal, collect\
      \ a \"shine\" which scores you one point, and then the level resets, but with\
      \ a different mission, so like the first mission could be getting to a hard\
      \ to reach place, then the second one being a boss or something. The player\
      \ with the most points after all eight rounds is the winner, then the server\
      \ goes to the next map.</p>\n<p>You can damage other players by jumping on them\
      \ (obviously), and spraying them with the water cannon. Collecting the yellow\
      \ coins (found scattered around the level, have a line pattern on them, and\
      \ dropped by dead enemies and players) restores 20 health, and gives you cash,\
      \ so you can buy upgrades for the pump, which are stored in a file on your computer\
      \ keeping your current coin total, upgrades, and lives (kind of like in an MMORPG).\
      \ You can earn lives by finding 50 yellow coins, finding 10 blue coins (rare,\
      \ and have a star pattern on them), getting 2 shines, or finding a mushroom\
      \ (uber-rare). If you run out of lives (dieing when you have none left), you\
      \ lose half of your coins, and all your upgrades.</p>\n<p>You can buy upgrades\
      \ (such as napalm or acid tanks to replace water, but can be switched back with\
      \ an assigned tank-switch button, or extra nozzle spaces for 200 coins a peice)\
      \ in the buy menu in the 3 or so minuite wait at the begining of the round,\
      \ or when you arent playing. Different nozzles can be found scattered around\
      \ the level (in crates), and dont go away when you pick them up, so you can\
      \ get the one you want even if someone reaches it before you. The hover is in\
      \ blue crates, speed is in grey crates, and rocket in red crates.</p>\n<p>Water\
      \ can be gotten in three ways:</p>\n<p>A.) Firing while standing/swimming in\
      \ a body of water</p>\n<p>B.) Collecting water bottles</p>\n<p>C.) Standing\
      \ in/running through water jets</p>\n<p>but acid or napalm would have to be\
      \ bought pre-round, seeing as you wouldnt normally find bottles of acid or tanks\
      \ of napalm just sitting around all the time (well, there may be acid/napalm/other\
      \ ammo bottles lying around in maps where it fits in, but if you made a map\
      \ for it, KEEP IT slightly REALISTIC). I'm taking out yoshi oand the fruit and\
      \ stuff, because it would probably be a bit hard to code.</p>\n<p>There would\
      \ also be AI enemies just milling around the level, waiting to kill/be killed.\
      \ Most are killed by water and jumping on them, others just by water, and other\
      \ by jumping. They are all weird, cartoony looking things that need to be wiped\
      \ off the face of the earth. Doing so will earn you cash for the upgrades which\
      \ you need to kill more enemies, players or bosses. Some enemies can only be\
      \ killed by special means, because they are too dangerous to approach or are\
      \ not damaged by jumping on them or water. Bosses would need a really good ass-kicking\
      \ to beat, and it may be wise to team up with other players to beat a boss,\
      \ before a mad fight over the shine. Wen you kill another player, s/he drops\
      \ 10 coins.</p>\n<p>The translator from Unreal 1 could make a comeback, but\
      \ in the form of reading signs or talking to people. The use button would activate\
      \ it, popping up the message. This could be a useful way of finding hidden stuff,\
      \ or getting free upgrades hidden in secret areas.</p>\n<p>As well as extra\
      \ tanks, you could buy/find water rockets and water balloons. Water rockets,\
      \ which if you havent mde one before, launch really fast from a high pressure\
      \ inside it, forcing water out the back, these, upon contact with a player/enemy/surface,\
      \ could burst causing splash damage (no pun intended) ovr a large area. The\
      \ water ballons would be simmilar, but act more like grenades out of a grenade\
      \ launcher. Both would be launched by the pump, allowing variable levels of\
      \ power to launch them with.</p>\n<p>If i can think of anythin else, i will\
      \ add it...</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Interested_Coders\">Interested\

      \ purpose backpack. One thing though: (no offence)I think the actuall game would\
      \ be a bit too childish (ie: cartoonish characters, jumping to kill someone).\
      \ But I am not a mario fan, so you can understand. Anyways, it's not the content\
      \ that makes it fun, but the gameplay! Good luck!</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> If\
      \ you were to store the player's equipment on the local harddrive it would be\
      \ very easy for them to cheat and set arbitrary values. You would likely have\
      \ to keep a list on the server of all players and their equipment.</p>\n<p><b>inio:</b>\
      \ I like this idea, but I have a few issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>nobody's going to\
      \ wait around 3 minutes for the match to start</li>\n<li>eight rounds will take\
      \ a very long time to play</li>\n<li>storing anything on the local HD is asking\
      \ to be hacked, and does the purchasing system really help the fun factor?</li>\n\
      <li>still <b>way</b> to close to the copyrighted inspiration</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So\
      \ how do the following modifications sound:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All players are going\
      \ for all shines at the same time.</li>\n<li>player/team with the most points\
      \ when the last shine is collected wins.</li>\n<li>collecting a shine gives\
      \ you(r team) 10 points, collecting 50 coins gives you(r team) ~7 points, killing\
      \ a player (on the other team) or enemy gives <i>you</i> 1 point (plus team\
      \ points for \"boss\" enemies).</li>\n<li>divide the groups into two or more\
      \ teams, shooting a member of your own team refills their tank. shooting a member\
      \ of the other team damages them. teams are color-coded and shoot color-coded\
      \ water.</li>\n<li>you start out with the cannon and hover nozzle, and can collect\
      \ other nozzles which may only last a certain amount of time and are selected\
      \ by the weapon select keys. The specifics of the other nozzles would need to\
      \ be changed for copyright reasons. Some ideas: Sniper Jet (think super-high-powered-supersoaker),\
      \ sprinkler (much wider range effect than standard nozzle, sorta like Flak normal\
      \ fire but wider)</li>\n<li>take the lives stuff out entirely.</li>\n<li>\"\
      shine\" would need to be changed, for copyright and/or trademark reasons.</li>\n\
      <li>tank power-ups that work until the first time you refill your tank after\
      \ collecting, such as: High Pressure (all weapons shoot twice as far and hover\
      \ nozzle makes you gain significant altitude, tank also empties twice as fast).\
      \ Sticky Water (water sticks to surfaces and explodes with a small spray after\
      \ a short period or when touched). Muck (all nozzles shoot muck instead of water\
      \ - players that come in contact with muck are slowed down, but the hover nozzle\
      \ doesn't work as good with muck).</li>\n<li>no fixed number of shines in a\
      \ map, but a HUD indicating how many there are and how many have been collected\
      \ by each team.</li>\n<li>HUD that shows the direction to 3 shines randomly\
      \ selected for each player by the server. This way all shines are guaranteed\
      \ to be collected on a reasonable time scale</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And finally one\
      \ idea that I'm not really sure of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make players carry the shine\
      \ they collected back to a team base. This would be hard if you want to allow\
      \ [i]n[/i] teams as mappers would have to construct enough bases. Maybe something\
      \ less significant like a team color coded teleporter thing that they need to\
      \ run through. Don't limit players to carrying only one shine though. This would\
      \ increase the tension and activity of the endgame significantly (especially\
      \ if it's tied up between two teams), it would add more roles for players (shine\
      \ drop defense &amp; opposing shine drop monitor/attacker), but it would make\
      \ the first several shine captures take longer and thus slow down the beginning\
      \ of games.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Icedude:</b> Yeah, i like those ideas&#160;:)\
      \ sounds like that'd make it better than the origional idea, but i dont really\
      \ like the \"Carry the shines/whatevers to a base\" thing, makes it too close\
      \ to CTF. The muck idea is nice, could be improved by having water wash away\
      \ muck, as well as diferent types of muck (fire muck, slippery muck, glow-in-the-dark\
      \ electric muck, etc.) as well as having a different type of muck thats placed\
      \ by the mapper that stays on the level untill it's washed away.</p>\n<p>Those\
      \ new nozzle ideas are good too, like the sniper one. That could slowly curve\
      \ downwards, and do less damage the further away the target is. Maybe the rocket\
      \ boost one combined with muck would make a muck cloud that you have to clear\
      \ with water otherwise it hurts you?</p>\n<p>And how about the mapper decides\
      \ what the objectives are? like you could have fluffy animals in oe map, and\
      \ machine parts in the next?</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage:\

      \ players (shine drop defense & opposing shine drop monitor/attacker), but it\
      \ would make the first several shine captures take longer and thus slow down\
      \ the beginning of games.\n\n'''Icedude:''' Yeah, i like those ideas :) sounds\
      \ like that'd make it better than the origional idea, but i dont really like\
      \ the \"Carry the shines/whatevers to a base\" thing, makes it too close to\
      \ CTF.  The muck idea is nice, could be improved by having water wash away muck,\
      \ as well as diferent types of muck (fire muck, slippery muck, glow-in-the-dark\
      \ electric muck, etc.) as well as having a different type of muck thats placed\
      \ by the mapper that stays on the level untill it's washed away.\n\nThose new\
      \ nozzle ideas are good too, like the sniper one. That could slowly curve downwards,\
      \ and do less damage the further away the target is. Maybe the rocket boost\
      \ one combined with muck would make a muck cloud that you have to clear with\
      \ water otherwise it hurts you?\n\nAnd how about the mapper decides what the\
      \ objectives are? like you could have fluffy animals in oe map, and machine\
      \ parts in the next?"
