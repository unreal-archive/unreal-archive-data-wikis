      \ 2003. It began as I tried to make some proof of concept gametypes for Freehold\
      \ NG.</p>\n<p>Basically, Riftwar is a partial conversion where three species\
      \ battle it out. There are Undead, Alien and Human classes to play and during\
      \ team games (usually Rift Control) all three teams fight each other at once,\
      \ as opposed to the usual two team approach of games. I should note here that\
      \ the original idea for a three team gametype was MoP's, Freehold's design lead.</p>\n\
      <p>When you enter the game, you'll be presented with a menu to pick your class.\
      \ You can find detailed descriptions of the species and their classes in the\
      \ \"EDF Field Report\" document under media. The short of it is, each class\
      \ has a different look, stats (speed, armor, weapon skill, agility), starting\
      \ weapon and \"powerup\". Powerups are kind like combos, but they occur automatically\
      \ when you hit 100 adrenaline. There are no other combos.</p>\n<p>Riftwar: Campaigns\
      \ brings the original Unreal Tournament 2003 partial conversion to the next\
      \ logical level - a massive war campaign. No longer are games isolated incidents,\
      \ now twelve maps have been divided between three different world to form one\
      \ complete game. Defend your world and use the riftgates to take the battles\
      \ to your opponent's. Take the capitol and you take the control of the world.\
      \ The first to control all three worlds wins the Riftwar.</p>\n<p>Campaigns\
      \ combines Team DM and classic Domination as you travel across the 12 worlds\
      \ of the Riftwar. Maps without control points can be one by being the first\
      \ team to get enough frags to satisfy a goal, whereas Rift Control maps are\
      \ scored by holding onto the control points.</p>\n<p><b>Author:</b> <a href=\"\
