      \ built into the <a href=\"/Legacy:TerrainInfo\" title=\"Legacy:TerrainInfo\"\
      >TerrainInfo</a> class, that interestingly is not used by the game itself. It\
      \ allows you to modify the heightmap of the terrain during play. Note that this\
      \ feature is unique to UT2003, and is not part of the stock Unreal Engine.</p>\n\
      <p>The ability to modify terrain in real-time makes it possible for you to have\
      \ your weapons create craters and all sorts of other mayhem. It is similar to\
      \ the GeoMod technology used in Red Faction, but does not work quite the same.\
      \ This form of terrain modification works simply by altering the height of different\
      \ points on the terrain, which means a couple of things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You\
      \ can't bore a tunnel through terrain using this. It is more like blasting a\
      \ hole, and then having that hole fill up with sand/dirt/whatever from above.</li>\n\
      <li>It looks a bit strange if you use it on extremely steep cliffs, but only\
      \ the steepest of cliffs (basically 90 degree cliffs) are affected by this.</li>\n\
      <li>The holes that are created have pointy bottoms. If you fall into a deep\
      \ crater you will be able to see \"outside the world\" because the bottom of\
      \ the hole is just wide enough for your player to fit in, but not the camera.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<p>Also note that because players are generally going to want to walk\
      \ over the ground, and cannot do so reasonably when it's filled with craters\
      \ and chasms. It is therefore important not to go overboard with terrain deformation.\
      \ Also be aware of any gameplay issues that may arise, such as the only entrances\
      \ to a flagbase being blocked off by chasms of deformed terrain.</p>\n<p>There\
      \ is also a limit to how deeply you can burrow, which I believe is the minimum\
      \ height of the heightmap. This means that eventually, if you crater it enough,\
      \ it will start to plateu at a much lower level.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ lies in a function called <b>PokeTerrain.</b> it's definition can be found\
      \ in the <a href=\"/Legacy:TerrainInfo\" title=\"Legacy:TerrainInfo\">TerrainInfo</a>\

      \ class=\"kw5\">int</span> MaxDepth <span class=\"br0\">)</span>;</pre></div>\n\
      </div>\n<p><b>WorldLocation</b> is the location that you want to make the crater.\
      \ The height above the terrain does not seem to make any difference, but I don't\
      \ believe it will work if the location specified is below the terrain. <b>Radius</b>\
      \ specifies the radius of the crater you want to make. <b>MaxDepth</b> specifies\
      \ the depth of crater you would like to make. Interestingly enough, although\
      \ in theory it should have been easy to implement, you cannot make a lump in\
      \ the terrain by using a negative maxdepth. You can only use poketerrain to\
      \ decrease the height of the terrain.</p>\n<p><b>Solid Snake:</b>Well, maybe\
      \ they fixed this a while ago, but with the latest patch you may use a negative\
      \ value to increase the height of the terrain.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that function\
      \ is a little buggy so some care is needed when using it. Generally you would\
      \ call it from within your HitWall function of your projectile. (hitting terrain\
      \ always calls HitWall instead of Landed) However, sometimes it will not work\
      \ if you simply use your Location as the WorldLocation. Sometimes it will, and\
      \ sometimes it won't - this seems to depend on the physical size of the projectile.\
      \ (it's collision height and radius) If your projectile does not seem to be\
      \ denting the terrain - this may be why. Fortunately, however, this can be easily\
      \ worked around by setting bBounce to true. bBounce is native and basically\
      \ forces the physics engine to keep this object from penetrating into the ground\
      \ when it hits. That should ensure that the projectile's location is always\
      \ above the terrain level and thus that the poketerrain always works.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Solid Snake:</b> Another way to fix this problem is to alter the location\
      \ of the PokeTerrain, by using something like this: HitLocation + 16 * Vector(HitNormal),\
      \ that way the PokeTerrain should always be above where the projectile hit.</p>\n\
      <p>To complete the effect, you should put a decal inside the new crater to give\
      \ it it's own texture. If you do not, it will have the same texture as the terrain\
      \ had before, which can look a bit silly if your redeemer leaves a craterful\
      \ of snow behind.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Everything_in_Moderation\"\

      \ may seem cool to have all your weapons deform terrain and make huge craters,\
      \ but trust me - it's not as cool as it seems. The crater created by the weapon\
      \ should be significantly smaller than the \"blast effect,\" for three reasons:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>There is no tweening on the deformation, and if it is not completely\
      \ covered by your other visual effects, it will look like crap as a chunk of\
      \ the world vanishes before your very eyes. Ideally your projectile should also\
      \ spawn some rocks and junk to come out so it looks like the chunk you removed\
      \ actually went somewhere.</li>\n<li>It's mentioned above, but very important\
      \ - although cratering the crap out of everything will not particularly impact\
      \ the framerate, it can inhibit gameplay. Craters can \"pile up\" and leave\
      \ a deep chasm or hole that people can fall into. Usually, they won't fall far\
      \ enough to die, but they'll still be stuck, and the camera will be outside\
      \ the world, which is ugly. Though it may also seem neat to \"open up new gameplay\
      \ options\" through the ability to deform terrain, a literally impassable moat\
      \ doesn't do much for gameplay. Also, things that were formerly placed nicely\
      \ can end up just hovering in space: static mesh lamp posts mounted on the terrain\
      \ will not \"fall\" into your new crater, for instance. Terrain Decoration Layers\
      \ usually conform to the new shape, but not always.</li>\n<li>It's just plain\
      \ unrealistic. A redeemer would probrably make a hole about the size of a luxury\
      \ car. Fragmentation rockets would do little more than scorch the surface of\
      \ the ground. Heck, a hydrogen bomb only takes a bite out of a small island.\
      \ The amount of actual material displaced by an explosion is generally quite\
      \ small compared to the area peppered by shrapnel and singed by the flames.</li>\n\

      \nThe heart of the terrain deformation lies in a function called '''PokeTerrain.'''\
      \ it's definition can be found in the [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]] class,\
      \ and looks like this:\n\n<uscript>\nnative final function PokeTerrain( vector\
      \ WorldLocation, int Radius, int MaxDepth );\n</uscript>\n\n'''WorldLocation'''\
      \ is the location that you want to make the crater. The height above the terrain\
      \ does not seem to make any difference, but I don't believe it will work if\
      \ the location specified is below the terrain. '''Radius''' specifies the radius\
      \  of the crater you want to make. '''MaxDepth''' specifies the depth of crater\
      \ you would like to make. Interestingly enough, although in theory it should\
      \ have been easy to implement, you cannot make a lump in the terrain by using\

      \ because the textures don't match the resultant terrain just doesn't look very\
      \ good or very real.\n\n'''RegularX:''' Hrm, thanks for the info.  I'll give\
      \ it a go anyway, since this project isn't FPS I think some luxuries can be\
      \ taken on the terrain looking good.  The replayability of random terrain should\
      \ trump it.\n\n'''FrozenCow''' I've made a picture of the result of PokeTerrain\
