    text: "<p>What this mod should allow you to do is destroy parts of vehicles without\
      \ destroying the vehicle itself. Let's take a Scorpion for example. Currently,\
      \ you can only destroy the blades seperately. Why not have the same for the\
      \ wheels &amp; turret? I believe that the wheels &amp; turrets are mounted by\
      \ \"bones\". A simple \"if\" statement applied to the bones might work-if not,\
      \ I can try editing the turrets &amp; wheels instead. Keep in mind that I just\
      \ finished my DVD Edition's VTMs, so I may not understand everything.</p>\n\
      <p>To-Do List:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Destroyable Turrets-They seem to work fine.</li>\n\
      <li>Destroyable Weapons-I haven't found a way to make them work yet. I remember\
      \ being able to destroy the Goliath cannon in my past exploits, but the code\

      \ Hmm, this would be simpler with UT2003's vehicle code, but may still be plausable\

      \ bones - they ARE bones. Basically, the entire vehicle is one mesh, simulated\
      \ by Karma. Basically, a ragdoll with it's own internal forces and stuff acting\
      \ on it's \"body parts.\" It should be possible to remove parts of it similar\
      \ to how limbs are \"gibbed\" from a player when they become a ragdoll, however,\
      \ I don't know how accessible the vehicle's turret code, etc. is and so I don't\
      \ know if you could plausably remove the functionality of turrets and wheels\
      \ and stuff.</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b> I found a bHasOwnHealth variable\
      \ in the ONSWeapon class. I experimented with it, and while the rear turret\
      \ of a Hellbender had 100 health instead of 600, no damage was taken when the\
      \ turret was shot. I was on the same team that it was set, so I added some bots\
      \ &amp; let them take it. A driver got in, later to be joined by a side gunner.\
      \ I shot the turret to no avail-it destroyed the Hellbender, and a Manta too!&#160;:)\
      \ I might have to set up a health system for this to work, but I'll try it after\
      \ I test it when it's fully manned.</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer 5/4/2004:</b>\
      \ I don't think it's working. I have to either check the hitbox or do smoe more\

      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> There's a discussion on the collision info for Skeletal Meshes\

      \ a while since I checked back, but I have it to the point where the Hellbender\
      \ rear turret can be destroyed with a shot from any weapon. I didn't have to\
      \ do any hitbox editing. I have problems setting the health, though, and you'll\
      \ get 3 \"Accessed None\"s in your log when you enter it, shoot it, or switch\

      \ Atari Forums...</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b> Setting the health to 300 through\
      \ DefaultProperties does NOTHING as far as the 1-shot-kill goes. I fired a Shock\

      \ A HellBender turret has to withstand more damage than THAT...</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b>\

      \ Mondays or Thursdays, so I'll have to wait 'til tomorrow to test this...</p>\n\
      <p><b>NamelessPlayer (5/7/2004):</b> That didn't help. I'll try putting spaces\
      \ at the beginning &amp; the end in-between the parentheses.</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b>\
      \ That STILL doesn't work. I made it so that it logs health as well. Apparently,\
      \ when shot, health is NOT deducted! It also only starts taking damage after\
      \ it's entered. Maybe I turned on something that wasn't neccesary?</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b>\
      \ I posted the code above. As you can see, it didn't change much. Adding the\
      \ Died function simply prevents the rear turret from taking ANY damage, and\
      \ removing it will enable you to destroy the turret-with one shot, regardless\
      \ of health!</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer (5/9/2004):</b> It was actually MUCH\
      \ simpler than expected-all I had to do was set some default properties &amp;\
      \ modify TakeDamage so that Health -= Damage! It works almost perfectly now-the\
      \ only problem is, it ignores Friendly fire settings. But right now, I'm moving\
      \ on to the other things.</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b> DOES ANYBODY ACTUALLY\
      \ SEE THIS? Okay, I edited the weapons to be destroyed as well. The only thing\
      \ left to do is add code to make wheels destroyable, but I can't compile my\
      \ own subclass of SVehicleWheel. Maybe I'm not doing something right.</p>\n\
      <p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b> Doesn't seem right when I'm mostly talking to myself\

      \ rear turret to act the way I wanted, but OTHER turrets get destroyed with\
      \ one shot! Also, the Leviathan weapons don't seem to have any collision detection.\
      \ I wonder what causes this...</p>\n<p><b>WheatPuppet:</b> I'm definitely paying\
      \ attention to this. I'm defining the basics of creating a simple Battlezone\
      \ mod for UT2k4 and sectored damage is an intersesting possibility to me. My\
      \ guess (and it's just that) for why leviathan turrets don't have collision\
      \ detection is becuause they weren't designed to take invividual damage (although\
      \ neither was the hellbender's...). I don't know how plausible it would be to\
      \ rewrite the Levi's collision code *shrug*.</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b>\
      \ VERY BAD NEWS-MY UT 2004 INSTALLATION IS SCREWED! First, I started crashing\
      \ when in windowed mode(a real pain in the ass when you're trying to use the\
      \ log), then I tried un-installing &amp; re-installing-but in the middle of\
      \ installation, I get a BLUE ERROR SCREEN TELLING ME TO RESTART! I've only had\
      \ this game for a little over a month! Any clue to what's going on?</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b>\
      \ Upgrade to XP or 2000, tbh, just pirate it, microsoft is a company that can\
      \ do without your money.</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b> I've been having XP.\
      \ My UT 2004 installation is back, but the problem that I tried to fix by re-installing\
      \ is still there-the windowed crash bug! It's annoying when you need to check\
      \ your log on a detailed map, mainly because the engine has to re-load all the\
      \ textures &amp; stuff before you can start playing again. Now, I've been having\
      \ this strange bug-only the Hellbender rear turret seens to have its health\
      \ working the way I want it to. I used the same code for pretty much everything-for\
      \ weapons, I added \"var int Health\", and the Goliath turret works fine, but\
      \ everything else is destroyed with one shot, and the Leviathan weapons don't\
      \ collide with anything.</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer:</b> Okay, the log problem\
      \ is gone. However, I still have yet to figure out a way to make ALL of the\
      \ turrets &amp; weapons work properly!</p>\n<p><b>Syntax Error:</b> You should\
      \ check in unreal ed if there are collision boxes for the leviathon turrets.\
      \ to see the box, load the mesh and click view -&gt; collison</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer\
      \ (8/19/2005):</b> It's been a long time since I've got back to this. I've borrowed\
      \ the TakeDamage code from class Vehicle, and it works fine as far as the HellBender\
      \ rear turret is concerned-but it DOES take up a bit of space just to fit all\
      \ of the TakeDamage code in. I've tried condensing the code to a simple \"event\
      \ Destroyed()\" with the \"if (Health &lt;1), destroy()\", but I get an \"infinite\
      \ script recursion\" error if I do it that way when the rear turret is destroyed.\
      \ The code posted is the working code for a destroyable HellBender rear turret.</p>\n\
      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> You're getting an infinite recursion because you're calling\
      \ the 'Destroy()' function inside the 'destroyed' function. So... because it's\
      \ health is lower than 1, it will keep calling itself over and over and over\
      \ and over and over... and then you have an infinite recursion.</p>\n<p><b>NamelessPlayer\
      \ (8/20/2005):</b> I can't believe I didn't notice this earlier. All I had to\
      \ do was enter the DefaultProperties settings &amp; I'm done-no functions/events\
      \ needed! Now all I have to do is find out how to destroy weapons &amp; wheels-I\
      \ also want to find a way to not entirely remove the vehicle seat if I, say,\
      \ destroyed the HellBender's side turret.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\n\

      \ tried condensing the code to a simple \"event Destroyed()\" with the \"if\
      \ (Health <1), destroy()\", but I get an \"infinite script recursion\" error\
      \ if I do it that way when the rear turret is destroyed. The code posted is\
      \ the working code for a destroyable HellBender rear turret.\n\n'''MythOpus:'''\
      \  You're getting an infinite recursion because you're calling the 'Destroy()'\
      \ function inside the 'destroyed' function.  So...  because it's health is lower\
      \ than 1, it will keep calling itself over and over and over and over and over...\
      \ and then you have an infinite recursion.\n\n'''NamelessPlayer (8/20/2005):'''\
      \ I can't believe I didn't notice this earlier. All I had to do was enter the\
      \ DefaultProperties settings & I'm done-no functions/events needed! Now all\
      \ I have to do is find out how to destroy weapons & wheels-I also want to find\
      \ a way to not entirely remove the vehicle seat if I, say, destroyed the HellBender's\
      \ side turret."
