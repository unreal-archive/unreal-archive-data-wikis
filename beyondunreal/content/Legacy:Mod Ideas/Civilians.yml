      \ just to avoid the overhead of unused combat code. That said, there's plenty\
      \ of useful code in Bots for navigation, etc. Recently I've found it's the UnrealPawn\
      \ PostBeginNetPlay() function that attempts to put the pawn on a roster; that's\
      \ where the (player) limit would be. If you can avoid that, you should be able\
