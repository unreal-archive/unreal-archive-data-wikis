      <p><b>Dezro:</b> For some reason, I'm working on this. Huh. I'm also adding\
      \ the leaf from SMB 3, which gives you bunch of extra jumps, and the poison\
      \ mushroom from the Japanese version of SMB 2, which, unlike the original, makes\
      \ you even smaller for a while (more like the mini mushroom from Smash Brothers\
      \ Melee and Mario Party 4, actually...)</p>\n<p><b>PieOnCar:</b>: Damn, I thought\
      \ I was the first one to think this up–but I was going to keep guns. I was going\
      \ to have a lower gravity for higher jumps, and have the better weapons come\
      \ out of certain, normal brick blocks when you hit them, and of course there\
      \ would be the classic question mark boxes. You could even implement a coin\
      \ system where you get an extra life (in limited number of lives games, of course)\
      \ at 100 coins. And there would be a bunch of warp pipes everywhere, and entering\
      \ one would either pop you out a random warp pipe or maybe throw you into the\
      \ \"dungeon\" sublevel. If it were a bombing run level, a sweet mod would be\
      \ having a koopa trooper shell for the ball... And for the experienced coders\
      \ out there, I have a few HUD mod ideas to go with this theme too: have a running\
      \ total of the coins on top, a score that would increase with kills and coins\
      \ collected, the timer, and \"World 1-1\" for the first version, 1-2 for the\
      \ update, etc. That's not even half the ideas I had for this. Maybe we can work\
      \ together, Dezro? AIM me at PieOnCar, or email at pieoncar@yahoo.com. I'm pretty\
      \ new to the whole mod scene, but I'm fair at modeling and Photoshop. I'd like\
      \ to get some coding experience because I'm going to USC (socal, not south carolina)\
      \ this fall to study computer science. Plus it's summer now, and I've got nothing\
      \ better to do. ^_^</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Discussion\"\
