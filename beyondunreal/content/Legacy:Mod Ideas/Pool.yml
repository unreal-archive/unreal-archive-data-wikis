      <p>This is based on billiards, known in the USA as \"pool\" and would be for\

      \ They would be on a pool table with pockets. It would be designed for two players\
      \ (could be more I suppose). Somehow you would want it so that only the player\
      \ whose turn it was could shoot. Each player would have an insta-gib shock rifle\
      \ to shoot the balls with. I've done crude experiments with karma spheres and\
      \ shooting them with the insta-gib rifle does work. The balls bounce off each\
      \ other and walls very nicely, much like real pool balls.</p>\n<p>You would\
      \ probably want it so that when a pool ball fell into a pocket it was destroyed\
      \ and a point was recorded for that player. Whether or not to try an implement\
      \ the standard rules of pool or make up new ones is a matter for debate. I see\
      \ no reason though why the exact rules of real life pool would need to be used.\
      \ Even a simple implementation would probably be very enjoyable. Also, there\
      \ might be some interesting opportunity for adding combat between the players\
      \ into the game, based somehow on the pool game. Perhaps the winner of the game\
      \ gets to frag the other player or something. There are all kinds of variations\
      \ of the concept that could be done. Let your imagination run wild!</p>\n<p>This\
