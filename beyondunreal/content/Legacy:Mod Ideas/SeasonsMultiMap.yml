      <p>The idea behind this mutator is to allow a map to have up to four different\

      \ St. Patrick's, etc.] but just the four seasons for now.)</p>\n<p>Almost like\

      \ in the texture set below, each texture begins with \"CDCover\" as a prefix\

      \ that the UTX package is called AryaMusic.utx.</p>\n<center>[[Image:Legacy_MultiSeasons-Covers.jpeg|]]</center>\n\
      <p>If the mutator is enabled either by the user or forcely activated by the\

      <p><b>Kirin:</b> Okay ... I put my idea on the table on the table ... what do\
      \ you think?&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> The idea has a certain appeal.\
      \ You'd have to have the map built especially for it though - rather than driving\
      \ it from a mutator. In terms of swapping meshes in and out of the map I'm not\
      \ sure you could do that as static meshes form part of the BSP tree. You could\
      \ create some decorations to do it though - and possibly re-skin existing static\
      \ meshes dynamically. I do like the idea of having lights appear on a Christmas\
      \ tree for a couple of weeks either side of Christmas.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>\
      \ Cool aspect... One problem, you may have to make a special map for the mutator,\
      \ and what if i don't want to play the map with the mutator, will it be playable??\
      \ Also, there could be a map that is like RocketArena like a haunted house in\

      \ maps could only be played with the Chaos mutator. However, unlike making it\
      \ a requirement, if the mutator is not loaded, there could be a default texture\
      \ in place which is the name of the texture prefix (eg. In the example I used\
      \ above, the name of the texture would have to be \"CDCover\") ... of course,\
      \ that could be up to the mapper if he/she wants to make the mutator a requirement\
