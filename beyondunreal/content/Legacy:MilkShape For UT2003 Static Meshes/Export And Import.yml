      \ in UEd3 is very straightforward. UEd can import models in the LWO (Lightwave\
      \ object) format, extension <i>.lwo</i>. However, the MS3D Export menu roll-out\
      \ has <i>three</i> LWO options – my experience is that the one shown in FIG\
      \ 13. works best when configured as shown.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div\

      \ width=\"694\" height=\"714\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>Note that <i>ALL</i>\
      \ objects in a MilkShape model file are exported – separate .lwo files must\
      \ be made for each object to be imported as a separate static mesh in UEd.</p>\n\
      <p>The origin of the MS3D workspace will define the pivot point for static meshes\
      \ made from MS3D models. This can be useful when building a complex assortment\
      \ of objects that must fit together in UEd, but are exported as separate LWOs\
      \ (e.g. the facades of a building, and its rooftop edge trim). After building\
      \ the components to fit in MS3D, make separate files of each component for export,\
      \ but do <i>not</i> move the objects in the component files. In UED the parts\
      \ can be easily reassembled due to the common pivot point for all the component\
      \ static meshes.</p>\n<p>Use the options described above to export the shuriken\
      \ model to filename <i>shuriken.lwo</i>. Save the LWO export in any convenient\
      \ directory.</p>\n<p>Launch UEd3, and open the Textures browser. Prior to importing\
      \ the LWO file as a static mesh, there <i>MUST</i> be textures present in the\
      \ Texture browser with names that match the material names assigned to the model\
      \ in MS3D. Any material name that is not found will be assigned Texture'Engine.DefaultTexture'\
      \ (bleah!), and smoothing info based on material names may be lost.</p>\n<p>In\
      \ the Textures browser, use File&gt;Import to create a new texture; use <b>Package:\
      \ MilkShapeMaterials, Group: NamedMaterials</b>, and <b>Name: hubs</b>. Add\
      \ textures named <i>UpSUrf</i> and <i>DownSurf</i> to this package and save\
      \ it (FIG. 14).</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"\

      \ lighting (too dim &amp; flat a lighting scheme and the smoothing may be harder\
      \ to see). Click the <b>Insert Static Mesh in Level</b> button to place <i>shuriken</i>\
      \ at the current camera position, then pull back the camera in the 3D window.</p>\n\
      <p>Inspect <i>shuriken</i> from a number of viewpoints, noting that there is\
      \ a visible hard-edge boundary between the <i>hubs</i>, <i>UpSurf</i>, and <i>DownSurf</i>\
      \ sections – the smoothing groups from MS3D have been preserved by assigning\

      \ to all three <b>Materials</b> property slots for <i>shuriken</i>. In the map,\

      \ UEd can import models in the LWO (Lightwave object) format, extension ''.lwo''.\
      \ However, the MS3D Export menu roll-out has ''three'' LWO options &ndash; my\

      \ shown. \n\n[[Image:Legacy_MS3D-LWOexport.gif|center|FIG. 13 LWO export options\
      \ to use in MilkShape 3D]]\n\nNote that ''ALL'' objects in a MilkShape model\
      \ file are exported &ndash; separate .lwo files must be made for each object\
      \ to be imported as a separate static mesh in UEd.\n\nThe origin of the MS3D\
      \ workspace will define the pivot point for static meshes made from MS3D models.\
