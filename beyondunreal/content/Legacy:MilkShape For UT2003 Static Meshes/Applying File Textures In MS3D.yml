      \ is pretty basic – it only provides for planar projection mapping. The projection\

      \ Front or Back. The faces of the model that are being mapped must be oriented\
      \ parallel to one of these viewplanes for textures to be mapped without stretching,\
      \ which complicates the texturing process. There are no numeric methods for\
      \ positioning textures, so very exact placements are tricky. Despite these limitations,\
      \ texture-mapping MS3D models can be successful if carefully planned.</p>\n\
      <p>For the shuriken model, a 256x256 texture was painted, using a screen capture\
      \ from the MS3D Top viewport as a guide. The texture is displayed below – download\
      \ it for use with this tutorial section. The JPEG format is OK for use in MS3D,\

      <p>In the TCE, note that <i>Regroup1</i> (the regrouped shuriken mesh) is selected\

      <p>The model now has a single material applied, which includes a texture file,\

      \ and specify the <i>shuriken.jpg</i> image as the texture file for each, and\
      \ change the Diffuse color to white. Essentially, these materials are now identical\
      \ to <i>shurikenTex</i> and to each other. Remember, only the material names\
      \ matter for UEd's smoothing operations. In the viewports, the shuriken model\
      \ does not change in appearance – the UV coordinates weren't changed by regrouping,\
