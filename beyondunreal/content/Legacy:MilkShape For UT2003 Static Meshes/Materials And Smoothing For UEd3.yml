      \nAssigning materials properly in MS3D is essential for preserving the smooth\

      MilkShape materials need not reference a file texture, although that is an option\
      \ which will be explained in the 4th part of this tutorial. Only material names\

      Press Ctrl+Shift+A to deselect all. Switch to Groups tab. In the Groups list,\
      \ highlight ''hubs'' and press the Groups box Select button. \n\nSwitch to '''Materials'''\
      \ tab. In the bottom set of buttons, click '''New'''. Rename ''Material01''\
      \ as ''hubs''. In the upper set of buttons, click '''Diffuse''' and select a\
      \ color from the Color Picker that opens. Click '''Assign''' at the bottom of\
      \ the Materials tab.\n\nIn the 3D window, ''hubs'' will reflect the color of\
      \ the new material if '''Smooth Shaded''' is enabled for that viewport (right-click\
      \ on a viewport to set the shading and other options).\n\nDeselect all, then\
      \ highlight and Select ''UpSurf'' in the Groups tab list. Using the procedure\
      \ described, create a new material named ''UpSurf'' and Assign it to the ''UpSurf''\
      \ group. Use a different Diffuse color for material ''UpSurf''.\n\nRepeat the\
      \ procedure to Assign a new material to group ''DownSurf''. Name the new material\
      \ ''DownSurf''.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_MS3DT-12.gif|center|FIG. 12 Material assignments\
