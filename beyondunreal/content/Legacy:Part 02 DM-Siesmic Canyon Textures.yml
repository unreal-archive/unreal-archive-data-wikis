    text: "<p>After searching the web for a short time, I found a texture that suited\
      \ my idea of what the pools would look like, it can be seen in <b>Tile #01</b>\
      \ below.</p>\n<p>I did a similar procedure as described in <a href=\"/Legacy:Part_01_DM-Siesmic_Canyon_Textures\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Part 01 DM-Siesmic Canyon Textures\">Part 01 DM-Siesmic Canyon\
      \ Textures</a>, and used Texture Maker in a similar fashion to make it seemless,\
      \ the final result, which can be seen in <b>Tile #02</b>, I found to be exactly\
      \ my idea of the hot sulphurous pools I imagined to find in DM-Siesmic Canyon.</p>\n\
      <p>I have also started a library of my custom content in UTEd4, and have saved\
      \ the content of what I made into its own file, this is not for distibuting\
      \ with the game, which is problematic (ask around for more info), but more to\
      \ keep a folder of my work in one place, I think it is a good idea, and if you\
      \ have lots in it, and think it is exceptional enough that other would use it,\
      \ you could easily make a custom content pack from it. This will also make it\
      \ easy to copy out the textures I/we make straight into our map, though you\
      \ will need to be carefull not to confuse the content, and mix the packages.\
      \ If you follow this procedure, you may have to go over your map when it is\
      \ finished and make sure all custom content comes directly from the package\
      \ named with the same package name as the level.</p>\n<p>I then imported all\
      \ my content to date, things from the earlier part, as well as any other things\
      \ I thought I might ever use again, in this or other maps/projects, then made\
      \ backups, and erased the loose stuff from my HDD <i>(Note: I kept all my original\
      \ Image Files, in Bitmap form, UT3 compresses to DDS unless you tell it not\
      \ too, DDS is lossy compression, and details are removed from it, if you use\
      \ too many instances of lossy compression on one picture, it quickly becomes\
      \ blurred or blocky, which is why it is always good to keep a high quality file\
      \ in a safe place)</i></p>\n<p>I then went back to Texture Maker, I wanted to\
      \ make some alpha maps.</p>\n<p>Alpha Maps are a special kind of image file\
      \ that uses a grey scale to determine the transperancy of a pixel, which is\
      \ commonly called it's alpha. In most instances, Black represents a pixel that\
      \ is compleatly transparent, and hence it does not get drawn, white represents\
      \ one the is totally opaque, or solid, and you can't see what is behind it,\
      \ all grey colors inbetween the two, determine pixels that are inbetween invisible\
      \ or solid, so that a nuetral medium grey at 50% brightness, will draw as a\
      \ pixel that is half solid, and half see through.</p>\n<p>In Texture Maker,\
      \ I went to the <b>Generator</b> function, and scrolled down in the function\
      \ selection to waves, then chose the function preset Bumpmap, I went to the\
      \ file menu at the top, and made 2 1024x1024 textures, and render both of them\
      \ with the function, simply by clicking on the image once, and waiting a few\
      \ seconds.</p>\n<p>One of the images, I then selected, and went to the Color\
      \ function selection, and selected Contrast in the drop down, The default value\
      \ of 150% in amplify was what I used, and did this 5 times on one of the wave\
      \ images, producing a sharper edge between white and black.</p>\n<p>I went to\
      \ tools in the menu bar, and selected the <b>Multi-Texture Mixer</b>, and place\
      \ four lots of the high contrast picture in the tabs, and 2 lots of the other,\
      \ my setup can be seen in <b>Tile #03</b> below, I then rendered this, and repeated\
      \ the process to make 3 lots of this texture, but with different patterns.</p>\n\
      <p>I saved these files to an easily findable place, and then fired up Photoshop,\
      \ and opened tham all inside of it, I then made a new image with the same dimensions\
      \ I had used for the textures <i>(1024x1024)</i>, I selected the first alpha\
      \ pattern map, and copied it to the clipboard, went back to the new image, went\
      \ to the channels tab in one of the tool windows, and selected the red channel,\
      \ and pasted it in, I repeated this procedure for the other two patterns pasting\
      \ them into the green and blue channels, my result can be seen in <b>Tile #04</b></p>\n\
      <p>I decided that one more texture should be made, and this would be for a particle\
      \ emmiter to make the interior of the water seem more alive. The creation of\
      \ it was fairly simple, I made a 512x512 texture in Texture Maker, and generated\
      \ a wave BumpMap as in the previous instances, 3 times, saved them, and then\
      \ opened them with photoshop, also using photoshop, I made another new 512x512\
      \ greyscale (8bit) image, I went to the layer tab in one of the toolbars, and\
      \ added a gradient fill, I made the colors range from black to white, in a linear\
      \ style, and chose radial producing a large soft white dot. I then selected\
      \ the whole canvas of this image and copied it, I went back to the first texture,\
      \ and clicked the channels tab on one of the toolbars, and added a channel,\
      \ and copied in the dot to this new channel, I did this with each of the textures\
      \ I had made in texture maker, I then selected one of the textures, and went\
      \ to the <b>Load Channel as Selection</b> button at the bottom of the channel\
      \ tool bar, and switched back to the RGB Channel and copied the selection. I\
      \ made another image, 512x512, this was an RGB image, and I made it solid black.\
      \ I pasted what I had copied a three times into the red channel, till it almost\
      \ seemed to have white, I did the same with the second into the green, and the\
      \ third into the blue, then just to enhance it I went to the <b>Auto Contrast</b>\
      \ in <i>image -&gt; adjustments</i>, and saved it as my water particle alpha.\
      \ <i>(Keep in mind, it is always better to stack 3 alphas into the one image,\
      \ thus saving yourself valuable size in your finished files)</i> You can see\
      \ the water particle below in <b>Tile #05</b>.</p>\n<p>With these three textures\
      \ I could make a nice water material, and from here I moved to the UTEd4 application\
      \ and continued there.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Image_Tiles\"\
