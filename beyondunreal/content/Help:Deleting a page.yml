      <p>Typically you would delete a page if the contents are entirely inappropriate,\
      \ and do not match the purposes of the wiki. In other situations you might prefer\
      \ a less extreme course of action, for example...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The page should\
      \ have a different title - So just \"move\" the page to a better title. See\
      \ <a href=\"/Help:Moving_a_page\" title=\"Help:Moving a page\">Help:Moving a\
      \ page</a></li>\n<li>The contents should have been placed on a different page\
      \ - So \"merge\" the contents into the existing page and then create a redirect.\
      \ See <a href=\"/Help:Redirects\" title=\"Help:Redirects\">Help:Redirects</a></li>\n\
      <li>The contents are already on a different page - So wipe away all the duplicate\
      \ content and leave behind a redirect. That way, this page title (which made\
      \ more sense to somebody), will helpfully redirect to the correct location of\
      \ the information. See <a href=\"/Help:Redirects\" title=\"Help:Redirects\"\
      >Help:Redirects</a></li>\n<li>The page is out-of-date - So update it! If the\
      \ page describes a current or future event, which has now passed, reword all\
      \ of the sentences to be in the past tense, that way you have created a page\
      \ which acts as a historical record. Alternatively label the information as\
      \ out-of-date, with a warning notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So in fact a straightforward\
      \ delete is generally only necessary if the <i>title</i> of the page is inappropriate.\
      \ In other situations, a merge and redirect is more appropriate.</p>\n<h3><span\

      <p>Deciding on appropriate content/page titles can be a difficult aspect of\
      \ wiki organization, and one which can often provoke debates. If the merge or\
      \ deletion you have in mind, is one which might cause upset, you should propose\
      \ the change first. Do this by leaving a note to give your reasons on the <a\
      \ href=\"/Help:Talk_pages\" title=\"Help:Talk pages\">talk page</a>. You might\
      \ also establish a system for labeling the page itself, with a delete/merge\

      \ (bottom left) will tell you which other wiki pages link in to the current\

      \ part of why wikis work. Every kind of editing operation can be reverted by\
      \ any other user, and that includes resurrecting deleted content. Try not to\
      \ let it wind you up too much. If you really want a page to be gone, propose\
      \ it for deletion by adding the {{<a href=\"/Template:Delete\" title=\"Template:Delete\"\
      >delete</a>}} tag and explaining the reason on the corresponding discussion\

      \ will see an extra tab 'delete' for deleting the current page. Procedures may\
      \ vary, but typically a sysop user might look for delete labels, and do a proper\
      \ delete on these pages, if the wiki community seems to agree on this action\
      \ (allowing a period of time for debate perhaps). In situations where the page\
      \ title is offensive, or the contents (which remain in the history) are legally\
