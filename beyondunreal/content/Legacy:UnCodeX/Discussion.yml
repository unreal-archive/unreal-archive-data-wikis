      \ open or close that would be cool as well. Just an idea, tell me what you think!\
      \ \n\n'''OlympusMons:''' Ok the more I thought about it the less I think this\
      \ would be handy a simple bookmarking feature would be nice.\n\n'''El Muerte:'''\
      \ code folding means I've to use a different control for the source code. Anyway,\
      \ I can live without code folding in a read only editor.\n\n==Comments==\n\n\
      '''Xhiris:''' I just found out you can put wiki markup in the comment tags for\
      \ the class wikifier's use.  Don't know if this is documented, but THANK YOU!\
      \ :)\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' it just uses the comments as is, so you can use\
      \ HTML and it will be used in the HTML output or wiki markup and you can use\
      \ it with the wikifier.\n\n'''AlphaOne:''' Thanks for documenting all the source.\
      \ I've added this page to my IE links (:o evial!)\n\n'''WARP-10:'''You guys\
      \ are pros but non-pros do get their hands on programs like this and there is\
      \ one thing that would be helpful: I would like to suggest that on this site\
      \ you list the default installation pathways for the packages for the currently\
      \ supported UnrealEngine games such as:\n\nC:\\****\\****\\**** or whatever.\n\
      \nI am attempting to use v232 of UnCodeX. Under \"Features\" at\n\nhttp://wiki.beyondunreal.com/Legacy:UnCodeX\
      \ \n\nthe first thing listed is \"Automatically detects packages\" when I do\
      \ not see that UnCodeX does that. The user must navigate to the source of the\
      \ package.\n\nAfter an extensive search I don't them listed here and I examined\
      \ 3 tutorials and a ton of other sites and still do not see a list of the default\
      \ installation pathways for the packages.\n\n:If you want to browse sources\
      \ you need to export or download them first anyway, so if you have the slightest\
      \ clue about what you are doing (you should know where you installed your game,\
      \ right?), you should also know where the sources are. —[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]]\
      \ 07:52, 29 October 2009 (UTC)\n\n'''WARP-10:''' I did or do have the proper\
      \ path and did export them all out of UnrealEd. There's 1,282 of them from Unreal\
      \ Gold.\n\nUnCodeX is not picking up on the presence of those .uc files. I can\
      \ open them with Notepad or my HTML editor. Even Firefox will display the scripts\
      \ properly.\n\nEven when I right click on the file and select to open it with\
      \ UnCodeX, UnCodeX opens but all panels are blank.\n\nI'm using XP Pro if that\
      \ matters any.\n\n:If you just exported the scripts, the source path to add\
      \ in UnCodeX is the Unreal base directory. If you moved the exported scripts\
      \ elsewhere, your source path is the directory that contains the Core, Engine,\
      \ et.c subdirs. —[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]] 11:41, 30 October 2009 (UTC)"
