      \ Great editor, i love it!&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b>It was definately\

      \ that the hell out...&#160;:). Anyways, I'm switching to using this as my default\
      \ text editor instead of <a href=\"/Legacy:ConTEXT\" title=\"Legacy:ConTEXT\"\
      >conTEXT</a> because context has troule with line wrapping. One thing I don't\
      \ like about this though is that it's 'save' toolbar is a pic of a pencil, not\
      \ a disk. which makes no sense to me. Oh. Also, I can set up the file association\
      \ for using this as the default editor for .txt files, but I still can't open\
      \ a file out of Explorer.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> You should use the following\

      \ in an existing jEdit window if there's already is a jEdit instance running.\
      \ If it bothers you that it sometimes decides to open multiple instances if\
      \ you open several files at the same time while jEdit isn't running, you can\
      \ set up an \"edit server\" (a hidden instance of jEdit) to be run at Windows\
      \ start.<br />\nAnd no, it doesn't have any problems with drive letters being\
      \ the root of the directory structures. It just has an awkward way to display\
      \ them in the directory tree due to the way they are handled in Java.</p>\n\n\
