    text: "<p>The basic concept of <b>Terrain</b> in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_Engine\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Unreal Engine\">Unreal Engine</a> (<a href=\"/Legacy:UT2003\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UT2003\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UT2003</a> and beyond) is based\
      \ around creating a large grid of polygons based on a heightmap and centered\
      \ around a <a href=\"/Legacy:TerrainInfo\" title=\"Legacy:TerrainInfo\">TerrainInfo</a>\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\">Actor</a>. Once that is in\
      \ place, the terrain tool bundle, which is actually a collection of tools, can\
      \ be used to perfect or even create from scratch a block of terrain for the\
      \ map. The possibilities for this are endless. It can be used for rolling terrain,\
      \ the floors and ceilings of caves, and probably many more things that creative\
      \ UT2003 mappers are sure to come up with in the future. Prior to UT2003, mappers\
      \ were limited to using BSP brushes to create terrain-like irregularities: see\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Terrain_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Making Terrain (UT)\"\
      >Making Terrain (UT)</a> for more on this.</p>\n<p>Terrains can be scaled as\
      \ big or as small as you want (and you can also have as many as you want). A\
      \ terrain could be a small area of a map within architecture, such as a sandy\
      \ courtyard, or the basic world space, such as with a large outdoor level.</p>\n\
