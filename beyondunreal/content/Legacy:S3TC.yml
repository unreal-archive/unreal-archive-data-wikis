      \ unknow why UED2 can successfully import textures in 24 bits BMP format. I've\
      \ tested a 2048 x 2048 x 2048 room with a 2048 x 2048 texture in both 8 bits\
      \ PCX and 24 bits format, the in game performance and quality were virtually\
      \ the same. The weirdest thing is, if you enable s3tc in the settings you'll\
      \ see a full resolution texture in game, but if you have s3tc turned off you'll\
      \ see a blury downsampled texture.</p>\n<p>According to some conversations with\
      \ Diehard from the Unreal Retexturing Project, both Unreal and Unreal Tournament\
      \ can take advantage of high resolution compressed textures. It's unknown which\
      \ tool was used to create the high resolution textures found in UT's CD2. What\
      \ is known is that if you install those textures from the second CD you'll certainly\
      \ face some issues while playing online. In many servers there is a well known\
      \ \"skating / sliding characters\" bug in case the player has installed the\
      \ high resolution textures. It seems that those textures should never be installed\
      \ server side, due to the previous noted issue with clients.</p>\n<p>I suspect\
      \ that the \"skating / sliding characters\" bug is caused by the skin textures.\
      \ Not all textures in the CD2 are at higher resolution. Doing some google searches\
      \ I've found that this bug can be related to a certain version of the skeletal\
      \ animations package.</p>\n<p>There is a UCC command called MergeDXT that enables\
      \ the creation of s3tc compatible UTX packages. Uarch has written a quick guide\
      \ on how to do it in UnrealSP community forums, it works as follow:</p>\n<p>-First\
      \ you'll need to create two exact copies of your UTX package, one cointaing\
      \ the regular 8 bits textures and one cointaining 24 bits Bitmap versions.-</p>\n\
      <p>-Keep both packages in different folders but with exact same names.-</p>\n\
      <p>-Next call UCC mergeDXT command to merge both packages into one.-</p>\n<p>Now\
      \ comes the question: What the heck does mergeDXT do to merge both UTX packages\
      \ in one and make s3tc possible? It's unknown wheter it's converting the textures\
      \ to DDS during the process or not.</p>\n<p>[Updated info] Judging by the filesize\
      \ from both UTX packages, the BMP version and the outputted \"what UCC calls\
      \ s3tc\" UTX package, there are three possible conclusions: 1. MergeDXT didn't\
      \ compress any texture. 2. MergeDXT did compress the textures using some extra\
      \ fast algorithm. 3. MergeDXT just flagged the textures, meaning that the compression\
      \ happens during load time.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"DDS\"\

      \ just found something neat. If you create a UTX package in UED3 containing\
      \ only DXT1 compressed textures you can actually use it in UT99! However you\
      \ need to force OpenGL rendering by editing the ini files to use DXT1 textures\
      \ within UED2; the software render is unable to proper display DXT textures\
      \ and will crash UED2 upon clicking any texture.</p>\n<p>Interestingly though,\
      \ you can use the mergeDXT trick to merge two UTX packages, one containg low\
      \ res palletized textures and one contained high res DXT1 compressed textures.\
      \ Even more surprinsingly a package done that way can be loaded in UED2 even\
      \ in software rendering mode.</p>\n<p>There is a tradeoff when you use pure\
      \ DDS textures. People with older hardware that doesn't support hardware texure\
      \ compression won't be able to run the map, on the other hand no palletes are\
      \ stored in the UTX package, meaning that you can safely mess with it without\
      \ ending with a \"couldn't not find pallete xxxx\" errors.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"\
