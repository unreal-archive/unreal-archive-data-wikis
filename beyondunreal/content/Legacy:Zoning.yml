      \ using a number of zone portals to separate areas of the map into air-tight\

      \ zone portals separate areas of the map in the corridors that join the map\
      \ areas. In particular, if you have a hallway between two rooms, it is beneficial\
      \ to place zone portal on either end of that hallway so that the room on the\
      \ other side can be thrown out from many view angles. This works because from\
      \ anywhere but straight on the portal on the other end of the hallway isn't\
      \ visible through the portal on the near end. It is also important to make portals\
      \ as small as possible while still sealing the zone because it is the source\
      \ geometry of the portal sheets that is used for determining visibility of objects\
      \ and other zone portals inside the zone.</p>\n<p>As a general rule of thumb\
      \ zone portals used in this manner should be visible from as few angles as possible.\
      \ Essentially, the less you can see these zone portals the better. However,\
      \ the only way to limit what angles the zone portal is visible from in UT2003\
      \ are to place additional zone portals or anti-portals in front of it.</p>\n\

      \ properties as you wish\n# [[Legacy:Rebuild|Rebuild]]\n\nIf you want the [[Legacy:SkyBox|SkyBox]]\
      \ to be visible, then they '''do''' need a ZoneInfo.\n\nYou can change the actor's\
      \ properties later without rebuilding, but rebuilding is necessary so UnrealEd\
      \ \"notices\" the ZoneInfo belongs with the zone.\n\n==How Zones Optimize==\n\

      \ cannot be seen.  This means that that area of the map need not be processed.\
      \  This lets the engine quickly throw out everything inside that zone.\n\nConversely,\
      \ if any part of the zone portal is visible then the parts of the zone that\
      \ are visible through the geometry of the brush(es) creating the zone portal(s)\

      \ the portal extends across the whole width of the room, where as in the right\
      \ image it only fills the doorway.  The middle is again the editor, this time\

      \  Bottom is in-game shots from the exact same position relative to the rooms,\
      \ showing how the zones in the left room do nothing, while the zones in the\
      \ right room cull to their bounds.\n\n==Related Topics ==\n* [[Legacy:Map Optimization|Map\
