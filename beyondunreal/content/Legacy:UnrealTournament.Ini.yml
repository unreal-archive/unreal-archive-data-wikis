      <p>The ServerPackages section specifies all of the packages that UT must load\

      \ that machine <i>must</i> have before they can play a game on that server.\
      \ If you have ever wondered why your friends have to spend ten minutes downloading\
      \ some mod before joining your server even when your are playing a default UT\
      \ game – then the ServerPackages section in your UnrealTournament.ini file is\
      \ the culprit.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"EditPackages\">EditPackages</span><span\

      <p>The EditPackages section sepcifies all of the packages that will be automatically\

      \ some or another package is missing, check the <i>EditPackages</i> lines in\
      \ UnrealTournament.ini and remove the line pointing to the package in question.\
      \ Stuff like that happens when you just delete a mod's .u files rather than\

      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Is this file always called this, even in UT2003? we have\

      \ Muerte TDS:</b> What about \"system configuration\", system config(system)\
      \ will save it into the main config file (game.exe -&gt; game.ini)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ I'm thinking of pages that rtell people to edit the file by hand. is it always\
      \ this filename in any game?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> It isn't the same in any\
      \ game, it's actually the name of the executable, with a different extension.\
      \ So, for instance, if you renamed UT2003.exe to SuperGame.exe, it would load\
      \ SuperGame.ini when you ran it.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> does Epic have a general\
      \ name for this particular type of file? Otherwise we can call it <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Game_Ini_File\" title=\"Legacy:Game Ini File\">Game Ini file</a></p>\n\
      <p><b>Corran:</b> I don't think Epic has a specific name for it. But they're\

      \ move this to the new title (and all the links will update automatically) or\
      \ make a new page and we'll have to rename each link? I guess either way some\
      \ will be suitable and some won't. How much of this page is general and can\
      \ be put on the new page <a href=\"/Legacy:Game_Ini_File\" title=\"Legacy:Game\
      \ Ini File\">Game Ini file</a>?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Pretty much everything\
      \ [UMenu.UnrealConsole]</p>\n<p>and below is just config vars specfic to UT.\
      \ The above stuff is probrably more or less universal across unreal engine games.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Ironblayde:</b> I updated a bunch of the sections, and encountered a couple\
      \ of questions. First, I noted that the [UWindow.WindowConsole] stores a key\
      \ binding in the form of an ASCII code. I haven't done any UnrealScript so I\
      \ don't know if it's ever used there... but is it worth creating a page explaining\
      \ this with an ASCII table on it? I could work one up fairly quickly if it's\
      \ needed.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Wormbo:</b> Actually it's a key code corresponding\
      \ to the EInputKey enum declared in UT2003's <a href=\"/Legacy:Interactions\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Interactions\">Interactions</a> class. I think there's a similar\
      \ enum in UT as well, but I can't remember where.\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Ironblayde:</b>\
      \ Aha, thanks for catching that. It seems that the values in that enum do correspond\
      \ to the ASCII code for those keys which have one, but I should have tested\
      \ it with a key that doesn't have a one-byte ASCII code, like the arrow keys!\
      \ I found the exact same enum you referred to in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_(UT)\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Actor (UT)\">Actor (UT)</a> class. I didn't see that fact spelled\
      \ out on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Actor (UT)\">Actor\
      \ (UT)</a> page, but I found it lurking in my actor.uc file nonetheless. Thanks\
      \ again.</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Secondly, ten of these sections, beginning\
      \ with [UBrowserUT], only require one sentence to explain the lot of them. I\
      \ left the first nine definitions blank and placed the definition along with\
      \ the tenth one; is that the preferred formatting? I've seen two terms listed\
      \ together on a definition line, but ten might look a bit cluttered.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ I've removed the trailing colons, that puts them closer together and tells\
      \ the reader about their relationship.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I've put them\
      \ on one line&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Ironblayde:</b> I did the same for six more\
      \ sections that all serve a similar purpose.&#160;:)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"\

      \ starts.\n\n:''Tip:''  If UnrealEd fails to start, claiming that some or another\
      \ package is missing, check the ''EditPackages'' lines in UnrealTournament.ini\
      \ and remove the line pointing to the package in question.  Stuff like that\
      \ happens when you just delete a mod's .u files rather than properly uninstalling\
      \ it, or when you moved your UnrealTournament.ini from an old installation to\
      \ a new one.\n\n==Headings==\n\nHere's the whole list of headings, freshly stripped\
      \ with TextPad. I have no idea if other sections are worth writing about, but\
      \ it's here should anyone wish to.\n\n; [URL] : Carries information such as\
      \ default player class, as well as default map and save extensions.\n; [FirstRun]\
      \ : When empty, this will force the engine to test your video configuration\
      \ (remember the first time you ever started UT, and it said it was testing for\
      \ optimal video configuration?).  Also shows whatever the current build of the\
      \ engine is.\n; [PackageRemap] : This is responsible for the fact that you can\
      \ summon e.g. \"UnrealI.ASMD\" (Unreal's ASMD) although it's saved in the UnrealShare\
      \ package.\n; [Engine.Engine] : This .ini entry shows what your default video,\
      \ audio, and network devices are.  Also shows what the default game type is.\n\
      ; [Core.System] : Entries under Core.System tell the engine what your default\
      \ directories are (System, Textures, etc.)  See [[Legacy:Releasing A Mod|Releasing\
      \ A Mod]]\n; [Engine.GameEngine] : Tells the engine the location of the Master\
      \ Servers, as well as default ServerPackages.\n; [WinDrv.WindowsClient] : \n\
      ; [XDrv.XClient] : \n; [Engine.Player] : \n; [Audio.GenericAudioSubsystem] :\
      \ \n; [Galaxy.GalaxyAudioSubsystem] : \n; [IpDrv.TcpNetDriver] : \n; [Engine.DemoRecDriver]\
      \ : \n; [Engine.GameReplicationInfo] : Contains the information sent to clients\
      \ when using this computer as a game server, such as the server name, administrator\
      \ contact information, and message of the day.\n; [IpDrv.TcpipConnection] :\
      \ \n; [IpServer.UdpServerQuery] : \n; [IpDrv.UdpBeacon] : \n; [SoftDrv.SoftwareRenderDevice],\
      \ [GlideDrv.GlideRenderDevice], [MetalDrv.MetalRenderDevice], [OpenGLDrv.OpenGLRenderDevice],\
      \ [D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice], [SglDrv.SglRenderDevice] : These six sections contain\
      \ graphical settings used with the various renderers available to UT: the software\
      \ renderer, Glide, (What's Metal?), OpenGL, Direct3D, and SGL. Many of these\
      \ settings are those which are not available in the game's standard preferences\
      \ screen. (You can edit them using the Advanced Preferences screen, accessible\
      \ by typing '''preferences''' into the console.) These include the ability to\
      \ toggle coronas, trilinear filtering, gamma correction, and so on. Some people\
      \ like disabling coronas in here, either to improve performance or to improve\
      \ visibility.\n; [Editor.EditorEngine] : Options for UnrealEd, as covered in\
      \ [[Legacy:UnrealEd Advanced Options|UnrealEd Advanced Options]].\n; [UMenu.UnrealConsole]\
      \ : \n; [UMenu.UMenuMenuBar] : \n; [Botpack.ChallengeBotInfo] : \n; [Botpack.DeathMatchPlus]\
      \ : Shows the game's default settings for Deathmatch.\n; [Botpack.CTFGame] :\
      \ Shows the game's default settings for Capture the Flag.\n; [Botpack.Domination]\
      \ : Shows the game's default settings for Domination.\n; [Botpack.Assault] :\
      \ Shows the game's default settings for Assault.\n; [Botpack.TeamGamePlus] :\
      \ Shows the game's default settings for Team Deathmatch.\n; [Engine.GameInfo]\
      \ : Default game settings, such as gore settings, game speed, game password,\
      \ etc.\n; [UnrealShare.UnrealGameOptionsMenu] : The only setting under this\
      \ is a boolean bCanModifyGore, which is by default, set to true.\n; [UBrowser.UBrowserMainClientWindow]\
      \ : Shows all the default tabs in the Network Game Browser (Ubrowser).\n\n;\
      \ [UBrowserUT], [UBrowserLAN], [UBrowserPopulated], [UBrowserDeathmatch], [UBrowserTeamGames],\
      \ [UBrowserCTF], [UBrowserDOM], [UBrowserAS], [UBrowserLMS], [UBrowserAll] :\
      \ These ten sections specify the search criteria that UT uses when you select\
      \ the corresponding tab on the Find Internet Games tab. \n; [UTMenu.UTMultiplayerMenu]\
      \ : Has settings for a pair of old online matching services - Heat.net and MPlayer.\n\
      ; [UWeb.WebServer] : Port, path and bEnabled settings for the UT Server Admin\
      \ web server.\n; [UBrowser.UBrowserHTTPClient] : \n; [UTServerAdmin.UTServerAdmin]\
      \ : Server admin username and password.\n; [WindowPositions] : Lists default\
      \ sizes and positions for various UnrealEd windows.\n; [UMenu.UMenuNetworkClientWindow]\
      \ : \n; [UTMenu.UTConsole] : Not sure what everything here is, but one function\
      \ of this section is to store passwords you've used to access game servers,\
      \ so that the next time you visit those servers, if the passwords are the same,\
      \ you won't need to input them again.\n; [UWindow.WindowConsole] : Stores the\
      \ key used to access the game console. The value is stored as a key code that\
      \ corresponds to the '''EInputKey''' enum found in the [[Legacy:Actor (UT)|Actor\
      \ (UT)]] class for Unreal Tournament, or the [[Legacy:Interactions|Interactions]]\
      \ class for UT 2003.\n; [Botpack.UTIntro] : A couple of boolean settings, including\
      \ bNoMonsters and bHumansOnly\n; [UTMenu.UTMenuBotmatchCW] : \n; [Engine.StatLog]\
      \ : Default settings, adressess and paths for Local and NGStats.\n; [UMenu.UMenuRootWindow]\
      \ : The current scale setting of the GUI, as well as which LookAndFeelClass\
      \ the engine is currently using.\n; [Botpack.LastManStanding] : \n; [Botpack.TrainingDM]\
      \ : \n; [Botpack.LadderLoadGame] : \n; [Botpack.TrainingDOM] : \n; [Botpack.LadderTransition]\

      \ : \n; [Botpack.ChallengeDMP] : \n; [UBrowser.UBrowserIRCSystemPage] : \n;\
      \ [UBrowser.UBrowserIRCSetupClient] : \n; [Botpack.TDMmaplist] : Stores your\
      \ current Deathmatch map list.\n; [Botpack.LadderNewGame] : \n; [UBrowser.UBrowserFavoritesFact]\
      \ : Holds the servers you've stored under the Favorites tab of the Find Internet\
      \ Games screen.\n; [UTMenu.UTServerSetupPage] : \n; [UTMenu.UTStartGameCW] :\
      \ \n; [UBrowser.UBrowserOpenCW] : Stores a list of recent addresses you've typed\
      \ into the Open Location dialog box. These are the addresses displayed when\
      \ you click the drop-down menu to the right of that box while in the game.\n\
      ; [UBrowserMMDM] : \n; [IpDrv.HTTPDownLoad] : \n; [UTMenu.UTMenuStartMatchCW]\
      \ : \n; [UTMenu.UTPasswordCW] : Contains a list of recently used passwords,\
      \ but unlike the [UTMenu.UTConsole] section, the passwords stored here seem\
      \ to be in chronological order starting with the most recently used, and they\
      \ are not paired with the server for which they were used.\n\n==Related Topics==\n\
      * [[Legacy:INI File|INI File]]\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Is this file\
      \ always called this, even in UT2003? we have several tutes that link here.\
      \ maybe we should use a generic name\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' What about \"system\
      \ configuration\", system config(system) will save it into the main config file\
      \ (game.exe -> game.ini)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'm thinking of pages that rtell\
      \ people to edit the file by hand. is it always this filename in any game?\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' It isn't the same in any game, it's actually the name of the\
      \ executable, with a different extension. So, for instance, if you renamed UT2003.exe\
      \ to SuperGame.exe, it would load SuperGame.ini when you ran it.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ does Epic have a general name for this particular type of file? Otherwise\
      \ we can call it [[Legacy:Game Ini File|Game Ini file]]\n\n'''Corran:''' I don't\
      \ think Epic has a specific name for it. But they're usually refered to as Game\
      \ Ini Files.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Ok. Should I move this to the new title (and\
      \ all the links will update automatically) or make a new page and we'll have\
      \ to rename each link? I guess either way some will be suitable and some won't.\
      \ How much of this page is general and can be put on the new page [[Legacy:Game\
      \ Ini File|Game Ini file]]?\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Pretty much everything <nowiki>[UMenu.UnrealConsole]</nowiki>\n\
      \nand below is just config vars specfic to UT. The above stuff is probrably\
      \ more or less universal across unreal engine games.\n\n'''Ironblayde:''' I\
      \ updated a bunch of the sections, and encountered a couple of questions. First,\
      \ I noted that the [UWindow.WindowConsole] stores a key binding in the form\
      \ of an ASCII code. I haven't done any UnrealScript so I don't know if it's\
      \ ever used there... but is it worth creating a page explaining this with an\
      \ ASCII table on it?  I could work one up fairly quickly if it's needed.\n:\
      \ '''Wormbo:''' Actually it's a key code corresponding to the EInputKey enum\
      \ declared in UT2003's [[Legacy:Interactions|Interactions]] class. I think there's\
      \ a similar enum in UT as well, but I can't remember where.\n:: '''Ironblayde:'''\
      \ Aha, thanks for catching that. It seems that the values in that enum do correspond\
      \ to the ASCII code for those keys which have one, but I should have tested\
      \ it with a key that doesn't have a one-byte ASCII code, like the arrow keys!\
      \ I found the exact same enum you referred to in the [[Legacy:Actor (UT)|Actor\
      \ (UT)]] class. I didn't see that fact spelled out on the [[Legacy:Actor (UT)|Actor\
      \ (UT)]] page, but I found it lurking in my actor.uc file nonetheless. Thanks\
      \ again.\n\nSecondly, ten of these sections, beginning with [UBrowserUT], only\
      \ require one sentence to explain the lot of them. I left the first nine definitions\
      \ blank and placed the definition along with the tenth one; is that the preferred\
      \ formatting? I've seen two terms listed together on a definition line, but\
      \ ten might look a bit cluttered.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I've removed the trailing\
      \ colons, that puts them closer together and tells the reader about their relationship.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' I've put them on one line :)\n\n'''Ironblayde:''' I did the\
      \ same for six more sections that all serve a similar purpose. :)\n\n----\n\n\
