      \ For DM\">Mapping_For_DM</a>, the <a href=\"/Legacy:Map_Flow\" title=\"Legacy:Map\
      \ Flow\">flow</a> of the level has to be considered in its entirety. There shouldn't\
      \ be any choking points on the map and few (if any) dead ends. CTF maps on the\
      \ other hand thrive on natural choke points and have, by their very nature,\
      \ at least two dead ends (ie. the flag rooms). The only important map flow is\
      \ between the two flag bases.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Creating_a_CTF_Map\"\

      \ Creating a CTF Map\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>When building a CTF map there are a number of things that are vital to its\
      \ success. These are summarised below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The flag room and the\
      \ location of the <a href=\"/Legacy:FlagBase\" title=\"Legacy:FlagBase\">FlagBase</a>\
      \ object within it.</li>\n<li>The location of the team spawning points.</li>\n\
      <li>The route(s) from a flag room into the central area (if there is one) of\
      \ your map.</li>\n<li>The balancing of the map and its weapons so that neither\
      \ team has an advantage over the other.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"/Legacy:LevelInfo\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:LevelInfo\">LevelInfo</a> -&gt; DefaultGameType set to <tt>xGame.xCTFGame</tt></li>\n\
      </ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Flag_Room\">The Flag Room</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_CTF?section=3\" title=\"Edit section: The\
      \ Flag Room\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>There are two styles of flag room you can use. You can either build a flag\
      \ room that is relatively open and reasonably large (e.g. Orbital, and Command),\
      \ or, you can go for a smaller flag room with obstacles (e.g. Coret, and Gauntlet).\
      \ Neither type of flag room is particularly advantageous to the attacking or\
      \ defending team. At this point advantage goes to whichever team is best in\
      \ the flag room environment itself.</p>\n<p>The flag room should have some health\
      \ and ammunition available to the defenders, and possibly a low powered weapon\
      \ (such as the Pulse or Bio Rifles). The more powerful weapons should be placed\
      \ away from the flag, or in an awkward position. This means that a flag's defenders\
      \ must be out of position to obtain them, placing the flag at some risk.</p>\n\
      <p>And finally, although it seems obvious, there should be no question in a\
      \ player's mind as to which team the flag room belongs to. It should be completely\
      \ obvious. Placing the flag on an obvious feature or making it the centerpoint\
      \ of the room is also a good idea - it serves to emphasise the location of the\
      \ flag. Just ensure that the feature used for this purpose doesn't obstruct\
      \ the player unexpectedly (the flag holder on Coret is a bugger for that).</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Team_Spawn_Points\">Team Spawn Points</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_CTF?section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Team\
      \ Spawn Points\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Spawn points need to be carefully placed. Place them near the center of a\
      \ map and the defence will have an easy ride. Place them behind the flag, or\
      \ level with the flag, and the attackers will have a far easier job escaping\
      \ with the flags as the defence may not be able to catch up with the escaping\
      \ flag carrier. Generally spawn points should be placed around the flag room\
      \ (but not necessarily within it) but no closer to the center of the map than\
      \ about half way through a base. It's generally better to favour the attacking\
      \ team when placing spawn points though as this ensures the focus of the defence\
      \ is on defending the base.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Routes_Between_the_Flags\"\
      >Routes Between the Flags</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_CTF?section=5\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Routes Between the Flags\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>How the routes between the two flag rooms are constructed\
      \ will determine how your map flows, and how it is paced.</p>\n<p>If you want\
      \ a fairly slow pace then the central area between the two flag rooms should\
      \ be very open, and long. The cover available to the flag carrier and his team\
      \ mates should be extremely limited. In this type of map there is normally only\
      \ a single choke point – the central area. <i>CTF-Hydro</i> is a good example\
      \ of this type of map. The bridges are really the only choke point in the level.\
      \ If you control them you control the game.</p>\n<p>A good example of a medium\
      \ paced map is <i>CTF-Coret</i>. The level is mainly corridor based with the\
      \ central area having plenty of pillars and cover for the flag carrier. The\
      \ map also has multiple routes between the flag rooms. The are plenty of opportunities\
      \ to move between the different routes between the two flag rooms, which helps\
      \ the flag carriers escape. There are two choke points in Coret, one in each\
      \ base. Each choke point is located just after the first door to each base.\
      \ The choke point is located at the ramp that links the upper and lower routes.\
      \ At the top of this ramp you can see everyone attempting to take the top route,\
      \ and hear people coming through the door trying to take the lower route.</p>\n\
      <p>Fast paced maps are always small. Both open and corridor fast paced maps\
      \ exist, and both work well when done right. Maps of this form are almost exclusively\
      \ based on a figure of eight, or, a straight line with occasional obstacles.\
      \ <i>CTF-Gauntlet</i> and <i>CTF-Niven</i> are good examples of this type of\
      \ map.</p>\n<p>Probably the best models to use when creating your routes between\
      \ the flags are one or more figure of 8's, or a braid type structure. <i>CTF-Command</i>\
      \ and <i>CTF-Gauntlet</i> are classic figure of eight maps. <i>CTF-Coret</i>\
      \ is much closer to the braid model as it has multiple cross over points and\
      \ loops.</p>\n<p>The routes between each of the flag rooms should be team coloured\
      \ at each end, and neutrally decorated in the center of the map. If it's a large\
      \ map consider putting obvious markers on walls that lead towards the flag rooms.\
      \ A player should never been in doubt as to which flag room they are heading\
      \ towards.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Map_Balance_.E2.80.93_Symmetry_or_Asymmetry\"\
      >Map Balance – Symmetry or Asymmetry</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_CTF?section=6\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Map Balance – Symmetry or Asymmetry\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The debate about\
      \ map symmetry for CTF games has raged long and hard. Rather than become embroiled\
      \ in a discussion that is well outside of the scope of this page I'll side step\
      \ the issue. Some points worthy of consideration are listed below.</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>Asymmetrical maps take forever to balance correctly and are harder to build\
      \ well.</li>\n<li>It is important that both teams have equal access to weapons,\
      \ health, and armour – even if the map is asymmetrical.</li>\n<li>A map that\
      \ is symmetrical in structure does not necessarily have to be symmetrical in\
      \ terms of theme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally, I would recommend making your\
      \ maps symmetrical: that way you can be completely sure that the map is balanced.\
      \ The symmetry can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>simple: The bases face each other. The\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:MapScale\" title=\"Legacy:MapScale\">MapScale</a> tool can\
      \ be used to quickly make one base a mirror image of the other.</li>\n<li>rotational:\
      \ drag-select the entire base, duplicate, and rotate to make base number two.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>Diagonal lines of symmetry (bases at right angles), or bases one above\
      \ the other are also sometimes seen. Be careful when building map bases above\
      \ each other. Although it seems that the lower team has an advantage because\
      \ their flag carrier can escape more easily, this is not the case. The lower\
      \ team will be overwhelmed by players from the upper team dropping into their\
      \ base - by simply falling. The upper team's ability to field players more quickly\
      \ makes covering the flag carrier much easier and more than offsets the lower\
      \ teams ability to escape faster.</p>\n<p>If you do decide to build an asymmetrical\
      \ map you absolutely must ensure that it gets extensively play tested by clans\
      \ that play regularly in leagues and ladders.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Make sure both bases have equal amounts of health,\
      \ weapons, armour, and other items that can be picked up. If the map is symmetrical\
      \ then the objects should be as well. Make sure that there is enough ammunition\
      \ and health for the number of players you envisage using the map. Also, make\
      \ sure there are enough player starts. You might think your map shouldn't be\
      \ played by more than 8 people at a time, but at some point someone will play\
      \ it with 16.</p>\n<p>Make sure you have enough <a href=\"/Legacy:PlayerStart\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:PlayerStart\">PlayerStarts</a> and that you assign them for\
      \ each team. Don't make a red team member spawn in the blue base or vice versa.\

      \ things that one might consider when going asymmetrical that are not issues\

  wikitext:
    text: "'''Capture the Flag (CTF):''' Two teams both have a movable flag that's\
      \ planted on an immobile flag base. A team scores a point by getting both flags\
      \ to their home flag base.\n\n==From Deathmatch to Capture the Flag==\n\nOn\
      \ the surface it may seem like a CTF map is simply just an elongated DM map\
      \ with a couple of flags and team spawn points thrown in for good measure. \
      \ Unfortunately this is not the case.  When [[Legacy:Mapping_For_DM|Mapping_For_DM]],\
      \ the [[Legacy:Map Flow|flow]] of the level has to be considered in its entirety.\
      \  There shouldn't be any choking points on the map and few (if any) dead ends.\
      \  CTF maps on the other hand thrive on natural choke points and have, by their\
      \ very nature, at least two dead ends (ie. the flag rooms).  The only important\
      \ map flow is between the two flag bases.\n\n==Creating a CTF Map==\n\nWhen\
      \ building a CTF map there are a number of things that are vital to its success.\
      \  These are summarised below.\n* The flag room and the location of the [[Legacy:FlagBase|FlagBase]]\
      \ object within it.\n* The location of the team spawning points.\n* The route(s)\
      \ from a flag room into the central area (if there is one) of your map.\n* The\
      \ balancing of the map and its weapons so that neither team has an advantage\
      \ over the other.\n* The [[Legacy:LevelInfo|LevelInfo]] -> DefaultGameType set\
      \ to <tt>xGame.xCTFGame</tt>\n\n===The Flag Room===\n\nThere are two styles\
      \ of flag room you can use.  You can either build a flag room that is relatively\
      \ open and reasonably large (e.g. Orbital, and Command), or, you can go for\
      \ a smaller flag room with obstacles (e.g. Coret, and Gauntlet).  Neither type\
      \ of flag room is particularly advantageous to the attacking or defending team.\
      \  At this point advantage goes to whichever team is best in the flag room environment\
      \ itself. \n\nThe flag room should have some health and ammunition available\
      \ to the defenders, and possibly a low powered weapon (such as the Pulse or\
      \ Bio Rifles).  The more powerful weapons should be placed away from the flag,\
      \ or in an awkward position.  This means that a flag's defenders must be out\
      \ of position to obtain them, placing the flag at some risk. \n\nAnd finally,\
      \ although it seems obvious, there should be no question in a player's mind\
      \ as to which team the flag room belongs to.  It should be completely obvious.\
      \  Placing the flag on an obvious feature or making it the centerpoint of the\
      \ room is also a good idea - it serves to emphasise the location of the flag.\
      \  Just ensure that the feature used for this purpose doesn't obstruct the player\
      \ unexpectedly (the flag holder on Coret is a bugger for that).\n\n===Team Spawn\
      \ Points===\n\nSpawn points need to be carefully placed.  Place them near the\
      \ center of a map and the defence will have an easy ride.  Place them behind\
      \ the flag, or level with the flag, and the attackers will have a far easier\
      \ job escaping with the flags as the defence may not be able to catch up with\
      \ the escaping flag carrier.  Generally spawn points should be placed around\
      \ the flag room (but not necessarily within it) but no closer to the center\
      \ of the map than about half way through a base.  It's generally better to favour\
      \ the attacking team when placing spawn points though as this ensures the focus\
      \ of the defence is on defending the base.\n\n===Routes Between the Flags===\n\
      \nHow the routes between the two flag rooms are constructed will determine how\
      \ your map flows, and how it is paced.\n\nIf you want a fairly slow pace then\
      \ the central area between the two flag rooms should be very open, and long.\
      \  The cover available to the flag carrier and his team mates should be extremely\
      \ limited.  In this type of map there is normally only a single choke point\
      \ &ndash; the central area.  ''CTF-Hydro'' is a good example of this type of\
      \ map.  The bridges are really the only choke point in the level.  If you control\
      \ them you control the game. \n\nA good example of a medium paced map is ''CTF-Coret''.\
      \  The level is mainly corridor based with the central area having plenty of\
      \ pillars and cover for the flag carrier.  The map also has multiple routes\
      \ between the flag rooms.  The are plenty of opportunities to move between the\
      \ different routes between the two flag rooms, which helps the flag carriers\
      \ escape.  There are two choke points in Coret, one in each base.  Each choke\
      \ point is located just after the first door to each base.  The choke point\
      \ is located at the ramp that links the upper and lower routes.  At the top\
      \ of this ramp you can see everyone attempting to take the top route, and hear\
      \ people coming through the door trying to take the lower route.\n\nFast paced\
      \ maps are always small.  Both open and corridor fast paced maps exist, and\
      \ both work well when done right.  Maps of this form are almost exclusively\
      \ based on a figure of eight, or, a straight line with occasional obstacles.\
      \  ''CTF-Gauntlet'' and ''CTF-Niven'' are good examples of this type of map.\n\
      \nProbably the best models to use when creating your routes between the flags\
      \ are one or more figure of 8's, or a braid type structure.  ''CTF-Command''\
      \ and ''CTF-Gauntlet'' are classic figure of eight maps.  ''CTF-Coret'' is much\
      \ closer to the braid model as it has multiple cross over points and loops.\n\
      \nThe routes between each of the flag rooms should be team coloured at each\
      \ end, and neutrally decorated in the center of the map.  If it's a large map\
      \ consider putting obvious markers on walls that lead towards the flag rooms.\
      \  A player should never been in doubt as to which flag room they are heading\
      \ towards.\n\n===Map Balance &ndash; Symmetry or Asymmetry===\n\nThe debate\
      \ about map symmetry for CTF games has raged long and hard.  Rather than become\
      \ embroiled in a discussion that is well outside of the scope of this page I'll\
      \ side step the issue.  Some points worthy of consideration are listed below.\n\
      * Asymmetrical maps take forever to balance correctly and are harder to build\
      \ well.\n* It is important that both teams have equal access to weapons, health,\
      \ and armour &ndash; even if the map is asymmetrical.\n* A map that is symmetrical\
      \ in structure does not necessarily have to be symmetrical in terms of theme.\n\
      \nPersonally, I would recommend making your maps symmetrical: that way you can\
      \ be completely sure that the map is balanced. The symmetry can be:\n* simple:\
      \ The bases face each other. The [[Legacy:MapScale|MapScale]] tool can be used\
      \ to quickly make one base a mirror image of the other.\n* rotational: drag-select\
      \ the entire base, duplicate, and rotate to make base number two.\n\nDiagonal\
      \ lines of symmetry (bases at right angles), or bases one above the other are\
      \ also sometimes seen.  Be careful when building map bases above each other.\
      \  Although it seems that the lower team has an advantage because their flag\
      \ carrier can escape more easily, this is not the case.  The lower team will\
      \ be overwhelmed by players from the upper team dropping into their base - by\
      \ simply falling.  The upper team's ability to field players more quickly makes\
      \ covering the flag carrier much easier and more than offsets the lower teams\
      \ ability to escape faster. \n\nIf you do decide to build an asymmetrical map\
      \ you absolutely must ensure that it gets extensively play tested by clans that\
      \ play regularly in leagues and ladders. \n\n==Item Placement==\n\nMake sure\
      \ both bases have equal amounts of health, weapons, armour, and other items\
      \ that can be picked up.  If the map is symmetrical then the objects should\
      \ be as well.  Make sure that there is enough ammunition and health for the\
      \ number of players you envisage using the map.  Also, make sure there are enough\
      \ player starts.  You might think your map shouldn't be played by more than\
      \ 8 people at a time, but at some point someone will play it with 16.\n\nMake\
      \ sure you have enough [[Legacy:PlayerStart|PlayerStart]]s and that you assign\
      \ them for each team.  Don't make a red team member spawn in the blue base or\
      \ vice versa.  See also [[Legacy:Team Number|Team Number]].\n* Team 0 is Red\
      \ \n* Team 1 is Blue\n\n==Troubleshooting==\n\nSome known problems with CTF\
      \ levels:\n; Bots won't get the flag : Try moving the end of your flag further\
      \ into the floor.  Don't worry about the overlap with geometry. It won't cause\
      \ [[Legacy:BSP Hole|BSP hole]]s.  It's also worth checking the bot-paths as\
      \ displayed within the path view.  You can find the path view toggle within\
      \ the [[Legacy:Viewport_Caption_Context_Menu|Viewport_Caption_Context_Menu]].\
      \  You may find that you don't have a path to the flag.\n\n; Bots only take\
      \ one path : Try using [[Legacy:AlternatePath|AlternatePath]] actors and setting\
      \ a priority on them.  You can also put items on an alternate path to entice\
      \ bots towards that direction. Also allow for translocation points and distance\
      \ shooting for bots.\n\n; The flag has fallen into a pit and is stuck there\
      \ : Make sure that all falls and drops have a [[Legacy:PainZone|PainZone]] at\
      \ the bottom - that way the flag will be returned when it drops into it.  A\
      \ map that suffers from this problem is ''CTF-High''. &ndash; Or, make sure\
      \ that the ZoneInfo(lava pressure vaccum etc) in the area you want the flag\
      \ to be returned has to have bStatic = True in the advanced properties.\n\n\
      ; The Map won't show up in the map list when creating a server in some cases.\
      \ : If you have periods in the map name (CTF-Level1.4) then eliminate them.\
      \  Underscores can also causes issues.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Topics\

      \n==Discussion==\n\n'''CH3Z:''' Some of the stylistic and opinionated statements\
      \ should be edited out of this page.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Personally, I'm all\
      \ for seeing wiki page text free of opinions and rants.  I say, go ahead and\
      \ clean up along those lines.  If you go too far, someone will pull it back.\n\
      \n'''CH3Z:''' It would be like trying figure out the best side of a sphere to\
      \ grab a hold of. Where would one start? I am hoping that the original author\
      \ will reconsider the content of this page and strip it down closer to the neccesary\
      \ facts that a person wanting to make a ctf map, according to '''their own'''\
      \ art and style, and to serve the kind of gameplay that '''that mapper''' desires\
      \ the map to offer, would find useful. \"There are two styles of flag room you\
      \ can use.\" awww shoot really? Is that all I get... two? It was good to mention\
      \ that there are the two ways, Symmetry or Asymmetry, and some insight into\
      \ things that one might consider when going asymmetrical that are not issues\
      \ of going symmetrical can be a very helpful point to touch on. But to point\
      \ out that it is an age old dispute and that you aren't going to touch it, then\
      \ turn around and show obviouse favor to one over the othre and discourage the\
      \ other... well... If a person '''can''' make an asymmetrical map that addresses\
      \ those issues and ends up well done then it will offer a much more realistic\
      \ environment then simple mirror image. So why not just give them the facts\
      \ and points to ponder and let them consider these things when producing for\
      \ us all to enjoy an new ctf map that is hopefully unique and not conformant\
      \ to any individuality-stiffling influence. That's just touching on a few things,\
      \ if I were to edit this page to \"just the facts\" I'm afraid it would be so\
      \ consice as to offend the author. I hope my comments don't serve the same appearance\
      \ of malintent. Blunt and to the point, yes, but not intentionally without tact.\
      \ I want people who read this page to bennefit from it and I believe I see among\
      \ the content herewithin statements that are less than supportive of that goal.\
      \ A consice page will serve very well actually. It is not necessary that a page\
      \ have any minimum amount of data on it. It is only necessary that it serve\
      \ it's purpose and serve it's intended audience.   \n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' I\
      \ ''think'' I might have been the original author of this page about a gazillion\
      \ years ago.  Feel free to edit it as you see fit - just try not to make it\
      \ so dry as to be upalatable.  I promise not to be offended :) - it was probably\
      \ written as a re-action to the endless stream of diabolical CTF maps I was\
      \ downloading and checking out at the time.  Sometimes an expressed opinion\
      \ can be more useful than a bunch of dry facts as you have to consider why you\
      \ would disagree.  But hey, I'm starting to ramble now (happens when you get\
      \ old).\n\n'''CH3Z:''' Mom! He just called me, \"OLD\"! I must have been some\
      \ kind of mood that day; looking at this page now, it's not out of hand, and\
      \ alot of the opinions seem to be popular opinion. So if no further discussion\
      \ follows soon supporting changes, I'll leave it alone and take the discussion\
      \ down. I might possibly make one or two slight changes, maybe none. \n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ Upon closer examination, this page doesn't seem overly ''rantish''.  The references\
      \ to specific maps may not be the most helpful, but it's not a big problem IMO.\
      \  Some of the info seems subjective, like flag rooms ''should'' be dead ends,\
      \ CTF maps ''need'' a choke point in the center, etc.  These should be defined\
      \ as suggestions, not guidelines. (again, IMHO)\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
