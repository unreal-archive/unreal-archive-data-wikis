      \ been an official Unreal gamespack for Gmax, making it difficult to export\
      \ models to Unreal. Follow these 5. steps to use Gmax as your modeller for Unreal.</p>\n\
      <p>1. First you will need to get Gmax, download it from <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.turbosquid.com/gmax\">Turbosquid</a>.\
      \ During the installation you will be asked for a serial code which can be attained\
      \ through the registration link provided in the setup program. The registration\
      \ is done at the Turbosquid site. Now create a model.</p>\n<p>2. Now that you\
      \ have Gmax, you will need the MD3 exporter to export the model outside of Gmax.\
      \ You can download Quake-3 MD3 exporter beta v1.0 (ExportMD3_gmax_beta1.zip)\
      \ from <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://pages.videotron.com/browser/\"\
      >Browser ICE's home of Chris Cookson GMAX and 3d max plugins/scripts</a> . MD3\
      \ is the format Quake3 uses for it's models. Put the dle file in the plugins\
      \ directory. The next time you load Gmax, you will be able to export to the\
      \ MD3 file format. From here it is only a small step.</p>\n<p>3. Download the\
      \ <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://doom3.planet-multiplayer.de/download.php?view.96\"\
      >Quake3 to Doom3 file converter</a>. Put the md3toASE file in the meshes directory\
      \ of Gmax, it is all you will need. Go to the directory in the Command Prompt\
      \ and use \"md3toASE myfile.md3 myfile.ase\" to convert your file. This converts\
      \ the file to .ASE file format. Now your file will work in Doom3. However if\
      \ you load it into UnrealEd, it will crash. This is due to a small bug in the\
      \ .ASE file format that the converter produces.</p>\n<p>4. You will need to\
      \ manually edit the numbers of the faces of the ASE file to have a ':' behind\
      \ them. Example:</p>\n<p>Old: *MESH_FACE 0 A: 3 B: 1 C: 0 AB: 1 BC: 1 CA: 1\
      \ *MESH_SMOOTHING *MESH_MTLID 0</p>\n<p>New: *MESH_FACE 0: A: 3 B: 1 C: 0 AB:\
      \ 1 BC: 1 CA: 1 *MESH_SMOOTHING *MESH_MTLID 0</p>\n<p>Also, edit the line with\
      \ the filename of the texture that you used (All sides of the model need to\
      \ be textured) to have the correct extension and remove the part that refers\
      \ to Doom</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BITMAP \"C:\\mybitmap.bmp\"</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>5. Now import your model in UnrealEd! Make sure to save your map before\
      \ importing, a small error is enough to crash UnrealEd...</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Tgusagalpa:</b>\
