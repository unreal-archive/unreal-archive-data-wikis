      \ Removed alot of stuff, stored in my head, not needed anymore (unless someone\
      \ else wants it?)</p>\n<p>Anyhow, i'm trying something new. Destroyable terrain.\
      \ No not destroyable objects, not terrain that you can lower by shooting at\
      \ it, but terrain where you can really blast holes in it, and then tunnel to\
      \ another side.</p>\n<p>Not possible you say? Well, I think it is. Basicly I\
      \ had this idea, if you place 4 terrain infos, and make the quads visible 1\
      \ after eachother then you could lower 1 quad without lowering the ones next\
      \ to it. There you have a hole. With even more terrain infos, and inverted terrain\
      \ infos you could make the tunnels.</p>\n<p>One if the problems is setting the\
      \ quad visibilities, but I found out that I can simply remove the \"const\"\
      \ in the editor, compile (without saving) and then access it with brush builders\
      \ to set it to the right numbers.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> Wow, thats a nice\
      \ hack. How much of it do you have working?</p>\n<p><b>Daid303:</b> Not much\
      \ actualy, I kinda have a problem with it. The poketerrain doesn't act the same\
      \ on all the terraininfos... Feel free to try to make it yourself.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b>\
      \ Now that I think of it I don't really understand what you're talking about.\
      \ Could you possibly make an example in ued with all thequads properly set,\
      \ and show us a screenshot?</p>\n<p>[[Image:Legacy_TunnelTerrainHack-Daid.jpeg|]]</p>\n\
      <p><b>Daid303:</b> The upperleft picture shows just 1 terrain info, the right\
      \ one are actualy 4 terraininfos, the lowerleft picture shows the same terrain\
      \ infos with diffrent textures. The idea is that I can now lower 1 quad without\
      \ moving the others around it.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I don't see why you need\
      \ 4 terrain infos. Can't you do it with just two? (one \"floor\" and one \"\
      roof\" interlocking, and when tunnelled through they separate at the point you\
      \ hit?</p>\n<p><b>Daid303:</b> Actualy, I need a total of 9. 4 for the top,\
      \ 4 for the roof of the tunnel, and 1 for the floor of the tunnel. The idea\
      \ is that you can have holes from the ground level to the tunnel level.</p>\n\
      <p><b>AlphaOne:</b> I think it would be better if you illustrate with more screenshots.\
      \ Try to show us what would happen AFTER some polygons were moved. Show us how\
      \ you want holes from the ground level to the tunnel level.</p>\n<p><b>Daid303:</b>\
      \ It's pretty hard to take screenshots from my head. It's still in the idea\
      \ phase, it doesn't work yet. Anyhow I found out why the poketerrain acted diffrent\
      \ on each terraininfo, it was basicly because I copy+paste them, and then they\
      \ all used the same hightmap. And that gave wierd stuff.</p>\n<p>I'll build\
      \ a drawing from the side how my idea is, could take a while.</p>\n<p><b>Daid303:</b>\
      \ Ok, updated the picture.</p>\n<p>The green and darkred lines are the top terrain\
      \ infos.</p>\n<p>The pink and blue lines are the roof of the tunnel terrain\
      \ infos.</p>\n<p>The thin lines are invisible and so can be walked trough.</p>\n\
      <p><b>AlphaOne:</b> O_o 2D pictures are rarely good for describing 3D concepts.\
      \ I'm opening UED so I can try to figure out how it might work. I just dont'\
      \ see why u can't just use two terrain infos, one for the top, and one for the\
      \ bottom of the 'cave'.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> No, I dunno man. It took me\
      \ for ever to setup the invisibility of for terrain infos. I moved one poly\
      \ up, and gave up. In the game for some reason other terrain infos moved up\
      \ as well.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I was thinking that originally, (that he'd\
      \ only need two) but I think that what he wants is to have the ability to tunnel\
      \ from the surface, underground, without disturbing the ground above the tunnel.</p>\n\
      <p><b>AlphaOne:</b> I noticed that. I sill, however, can't understand how he\
      \ wants it to work.</p>\n<p><b>Daid303:</b> Well, I still haven't been able\
      \ to get it to work myself (I forgot how many times I messed up the terrain\
      \ infos already) but in my head it can work. It's just hard to explain...</p>\n\

      \ wierd stuff.\n\nI'll build a drawing from the side how my idea is, could take\
      \ a while.\n\n'''Daid303:''' Ok, updated the picture.\n\nThe green and darkred\
      \ lines are the top terrain infos.\n\nThe pink and blue lines are the roof of\
      \ the tunnel terrain infos.\n\nThe thin lines are invisible and so can be walked\
      \ trough.\n\n'''AlphaOne:''' O_o 2D pictures are rarely good for describing\
      \ 3D concepts. I'm opening UED so I can try to figure out how it might work.\
      \ I just dont' see why u can't just use two terrain infos, one for the top,\
      \ and one for the bottom of the 'cave'.\n\n'''AlphaOne:''' No, I dunno man.\
      \ It took me for ever to setup the invisibility of for terrain infos. I moved\
      \ one poly up, and gave up. In the game for some reason other terrain infos\
      \ moved up as well.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I was thinking that originally, (that he'd\
      \ only need two) but I think that what he wants is to have the ability to tunnel\
      \ from the surface, underground, without disturbing the ground above the tunnel.\n\
      \n'''AlphaOne:''' I noticed that. I sill, however, can't understand how he wants\
      \ it to work.\n\n'''Daid303:''' Well, I still haven't been able to get it to\
      \ work myself (I forgot how many times I messed up the terrain infos already)\
      \ but in my head it can work. It's just hard to explain...\n[[Category:Legacy\
