      \ places should be small (only big enough for a player) and have really only\
      \ one way out: towards the field of play. This can be in the form of a small\
      \ ledge or hole in the wall, above the action, so that once a player spawns\
      \ they will drop down and be unable to go back up to spawn camp. Other one-way\
      \ devices are sometimes used in this capacity: teleporters, etc.</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ a PlayerStart next to the edge of a cliff (or other near terminal position).\
      \ Sometimes momentum after a death is carried through to the spawning player.\
      \ It's annoying to spawn only to immediately fall to a messy end.</li>\n<li>Check\
      \ the orientation of your player start positions and ensure that they face sensible\
      \ directions, don't make them spawn and have a wall in their face. Again, to\
      \ change the direction of directional actors, like PlayerStarts, use the Top\
      \ View to select the actor and use the Right mouse button to click and drag\
      \ the red arrow indicator in a new direction.</li>\n<li>When a player spawns,\
      \ the first thing he'll look for is a weapon. If not close to a weapon, at least\
      \ try to orient the PlayerStart to face the nearest one.</li>\n<li>In team games\
      \ always check the owning team of your player start. Set the <a href=\"/Legacy:Team_Number\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Team Number\">team number</a> in the PlayerStart -&gt; TeamNumber\
      \ property (0=red, 1=blue)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Deathmatch and TeamDeathmatch\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Placing the playerstarts in\
      \ Deathmatch is the easiest out of the other team based gametypes to do, but\
      \ you have to, like the other gametypes, place them carefully. You should make\
      \ the playerstart points approxamently equidistant from any power-ups in the\
      \ level, like the damage amp or the big keg o' health, as you can. Also avoid\
      \ placing the playerstart points in areas of the map that see a lot of action,\
      \ because that will lead to spawn killing. Try to place the playerstart points\
      \ in cover, such as girders, if you can. The more playerstart positions you\
      \ have, the better as this makes spawn camping that much harder. Also it adds\
      \ more diversity to the level.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Capture_the_Flag\"\

      \ section: Capture the Flag\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Start positions for CTF games must be placed carefully,\
      \ and, if at all possible, symmetrically for each team. It is important that\
      \ respawning players can get back into the action quickly, especially if they\
      \ have just been killed defending the flag. Be wary of putting player start\
      \ positions too close to the middle of the map. It can make escaping with the\
      \ flag incredibly difficult if you have to kill any given defender three times\
      \ before you reach the center of the map. As a general rule of thumb it's a\
      \ good idea to keep the central area clear of player start points. It's also\
      \ worth only placing start points in the \"back\" 3/4 of a base.</p>\n<p>Possibly\
      \ the best examples of poor start point placement in CTF games come from the\
      \ \"Face\" series. Face placed players in full view of enemy snipers, miles\
      \ away from any real weapons or ammo. Face][ has a number of start points at\
      \ the bottom of not one but two very slow lifts. Not only does it make getting\
      \ back into the game extremely slow, but it also means that other spawning players\
      \ can \"steal\" the lift from players already waiting. Face3 (of UT2003 fame)\
      \ has players respawn in \"Pods\". The problem with this is that if you get\
      \ killed after the enemy team has grabbed your flag you are effectively out\
      \ of the game. You will find it extremely hard to catch up to the enemy flag\
      \ carrier. In the unlikely event that you do manage to catch the flag carrier\
      \ you'll have not had time to collect anything to help you dispose of them.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bombing_Run\">Bombing Run</span><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Placing_PlayerStart?section=6\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Bombing Run\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Bombing Run game type is one of the easier game\
      \ types to place player starts for. This is because the spawn point use is more\
      \ consistent due to the player reset after each round. The spawn points for\
      \ each of the teams should be equidistant from the ball starting position. Giving\
      \ one team an advantage by having them able to get to the ball faster (or get\
      \ more players to the ball faster) will dramatically unbalance the gameplay.</p>\n\
      <p>Never place player start points next to a bombing run goal. Instead place\
      \ them a little way away or off to one side. You should try and avoid an attacker\
      \ coming under fire immediately from a player they have just killed should they\
      \ be in sight of the goal. Having said that, there should be a couple of player\
      \ start points reasonably close to the goal mouth to allow the goal keepers\
      \ to get back into position reasonably quickly.</p>\n<p>Player start positions\
      \ should also be placed reasonably close to mid and low power weapons. It's\
      \ fine to make players do a bit of extra work to get to the rocket launcher\
      \ (or other powerful weapons) but don't force them to run around with the Assault\
      \ Rifle for an age.</p>\n<p>Try not to place start points along the main routes\
      \ to the goal mouth. It will make scoring very difficult. Sometimes this is\
      \ unavoidable, simply because of the structure of the map, but if it can be\
      \ avoided it's worth doing. Consider starting players in side rooms away from\
      \ the main areas of conflict.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Double_Domination\"\

      \ section: Double Domination\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Double Domination game type is perhaps the hardest\
      \ gametype to place player starts for. The nature of the game type inherently\
      \ encourages spawn camping - it's way easier to hold control points if you can\
      \ kill the enemy team when they are vulnerable (ie. have no weapons after respawning).\
      \ There needs to be enough start points that spawn camping is difficult, but\
      \ not so many that the map becomes unbalanced.</p>\n<p>All start points must\
      \ be equidistant (as much as the map structure allows) from the control points.\
      \ It is reasonable to place one set of player starts near one control point,\
      \ and another set of player starts near another. However, if you do this, make\
      \ sure that both sets are the same distance away from their closest control\
      \ point.</p>\n<p>How close you place the start points to the control points\
      \ will very much determine the pace of the game. If you want a fast paced game\
      \ where it's very hard to score then move the player start points closer to\
      \ the control points. If you want a slower paced game with more scoring then\
      \ move the player starts away from the control points. It is suggested that\
      \ it should take a minimum of 3 seconds to reach a control point from a player\
      \ start, and a maximum of 9 seconds.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ the level</li>\n<li>Players should have to travel to reach Control points.</li>\n\
      <li>Players should be able to obtain weapons en-route to a control point without\
      \ travelling a significant amount of distance in the wrong direction.</li>\n\
      <li>Try to avoid placing a start point within direct sight of a Control Point.</li>\n\

      <p>Each base should contain AT LEAST enough PlayerStarts to fit half of the\
      \ maximum player amount. In addition, nodes are probably best off with about\

      \ have a weapon locker nearby and should be facing it. If possible, also try\

      \ If you have a large map, having 8 PlayerStarts in a half or a full circle\

      \ after a death is carried through to the spawning player.  It's annoying to\
      \ spawn only to immediately fall to a messy end.\n* Check the orientation of\
      \ your player start positions and ensure that they face sensible directions,\
      \ don't make them spawn and have a wall in their face.  Again, to change the\
      \ direction of directional actors, like PlayerStarts, use the Top View to select\
      \ the actor and use the Right mouse button to click and drag the red arrow indicator\
      \ in a new direction.\n* When a player spawns, the first thing he'll look for\
      \ is a weapon. If not close to a weapon, at least try to orient the PlayerStart\
      \ to face the nearest one.\n* In team games always check the owning team of\
      \ your player start. Set the [[Legacy:Team Number|team number]] in the PlayerStart\
      \ -> TeamNumber property (0=red, 1=blue)\n\n==Gametype Specific Notes==\n\n\
      ===Deathmatch and TeamDeathmatch===\n\nPlacing the playerstarts in Deathmatch\
      \ is the easiest out of the other team based gametypes to do, but you have to,\
      \ like the other gametypes, place them carefully. You should make the playerstart\
      \ points approxamently equidistant from any power-ups in the level, like the\
      \ damage amp or the big keg o' health, as you can. Also avoid placing the playerstart\
      \ points in areas of the map that see a lot of action, because that will lead\
      \ to spawn killing. Try to place the playerstart points in cover, such as girders,\
      \ if you can. The more playerstart positions you have, the better as this makes\
      \ spawn camping that much harder. Also it adds more diversity to the level.\n\
      \n===Capture the Flag===\n\nStart positions for CTF games must be placed carefully,\
      \ and, if at all possible, symmetrically for each team.  It is important that\
      \ respawning players can get back into the action quickly, especially if they\
      \ have just been killed defending the flag.  Be wary of putting player start\
      \ positions too close to the middle of the map.  It can make escaping with the\
      \ flag incredibly difficult if you have to kill any given defender three times\
      \ before you reach the center of the map.  As a general rule of thumb it's a\
      \ good idea to keep the central area clear of player start points.  It's also\
      \ worth only placing start points in the \"back\" 3/4 of a base.\n\nPossibly\
      \ the best examples of poor start point placement in CTF games come from the\
      \ \"Face\" series.  Face placed players in full view of enemy snipers, miles\
      \ away from any real weapons or ammo.  Face][ has a number of start points at\
      \ the bottom of not one but two very slow lifts.  Not only does it make getting\
      \ back into the game extremely slow, but it also means that other spawning players\
      \ can \"steal\" the lift from players already waiting. Face3 (of UT2003 fame)\
      \ has players respawn in \"Pods\".  The problem with this is that if you get\
      \ killed after the enemy team has grabbed your flag you are effectively out\
      \ of the game.  You will find it extremely hard to catch up to the enemy flag\
      \ carrier.  In the unlikely event that you do manage to catch the flag carrier\
      \ you'll have not had time to collect anything to help you dispose of them.\n\
      \n===Bombing Run===\n\nThe Bombing Run game type is one of the easier game types\
      \ to place player starts for.  This is because the spawn point use is more consistent\
      \ due to the player reset after each round.  The spawn points for each of the\
      \ teams should be equidistant from the ball starting position.  Giving one team\
      \ an advantage by having them able to get to the ball faster (or get more players\
      \ to the ball faster) will dramatically unbalance the gameplay.\n\nNever place\
      \ player start points next to a bombing run goal.  Instead place them a little\
      \ way away or off to one side.  You should try and avoid an attacker coming\
      \ under fire immediately from a player they have just killed should they be\
      \ in sight of the goal.  Having said that, there should be a couple of player\
      \ start points reasonably close to the goal mouth to allow the goal keepers\
      \ to get back into position reasonably quickly.\n\nPlayer start positions should\
      \ also be placed reasonably close to mid and low power weapons.  It's fine to\
      \ make players do a bit of extra work to get to the rocket launcher (or other\
      \ powerful weapons) but don't force them to run around with the Assault Rifle\
      \ for an age.\n\nTry not to place start points along the main routes to the\
      \ goal mouth.  It will make scoring very difficult.  Sometimes this is unavoidable,\
      \ simply because of the structure of the map, but if it can be avoided it's\
      \ worth doing.  Consider starting players in side rooms away from the main areas\
      \ of conflict.\n\n===Double Domination===\n\nThe Double Domination game type\
      \ is perhaps the hardest gametype to place player starts for.  The nature of\
      \ the game type inherently encourages spawn camping - it's way easier to hold\
      \ control points if you can kill the enemy team when they are vulnerable (ie.\
      \ have no weapons after respawning).  There needs to be enough start points\
      \ that spawn camping is difficult, but not so many that the map becomes unbalanced.\n\
      \nAll start points must be equidistant (as much as the map structure allows)\
      \ from the control points.  It is reasonable to place one set of player starts\
      \ near one control point, and another set of player starts near another.  However,\
      \ if you do this, make sure that both sets are the same distance away from their\
      \ closest control point.\n\nHow close you place the start points to the control\
      \ points will very much determine the pace of the game.  If you want a fast\
      \ paced game where it's very hard to score then move the player start points\
      \ closer to the control points.  If you want a slower paced game with more scoring\
      \ then move the player starts away from the control points.  It is suggested\
      \ that it should take a minimum of 3 seconds to reach a control point from a\
      \ player start, and a maximum of 9 seconds.\n\n===Domination===\n* Spawn points\
      \ should be well spread throughout the level\n* Players should have to travel\
      \ to reach Control points.\n* Players should be able to obtain weapons en-route\
      \ to a control point without travelling a significant amount of distance in\
      \ the wrong direction.\n* Try to avoid placing a start point within direct sight\
      \ of a Control Point.\n\n===Onslaught===\n\nEach base should contain AT LEAST\
      \ enough PlayerStarts to fit half of the maximum player amount. In addition,\
      \ nodes are probably best off with about half that amount. This may sound like\
      \ a lot, but you never know what kind of crazy link setups players come up with.\n\
      \nEach respawn point should have a weapon locker nearby and should be facing\
      \ it. If possible, also try to orient them so that players don't start facing\
      \ the outside of the level. If you have a large map, having 8 PlayerStarts in\
      \ a half or a full circle around a weapon locker is a good rule of thumb.\n\n\
