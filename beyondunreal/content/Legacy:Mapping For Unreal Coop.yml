      <p>Weapons should be made available to players at the beginning of each level.\

      \ Remember that most Coop servers will be set up so that weapons instantly respawn\
      \ after they're picked up. In other words, players will start moving into the\
      \ level with fully loaded weapons of whatever type you leave them.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ title=\"Legacy:Actor (UT)/Filter\">Filter</a> properties of various Actors\
      \ that you place in your level. Though these properties are primarily used to\

      <li>bNet</li>\n<li>bNetSpecial</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, you could have that\
      \ unbalancing Flak Cannon near the beginning of your level be missing when the\
      \ level is played online, or you could create an extra team of Krall that will\
      \ only be there when the level is played online. Also, remember that CreatureFactories\
      \ can be set up to produce an additional number of creatures specifically for\
      \ Coop games. The variable is <b>AddedCoopCapacity</b>. This is yet another\

      \ a room and you would have to face some major enemy or group of enemies? You\
      \ shouldn't abandon these ideas if you're planning on making your maps Coop-compatible.\
      \ On the other hand, you'll certainly need to tweak them a bit so that they\
      \ still work in coop. This is most easily done by making an alternate entrance\
      \ into the combat area. Seal off the area with a <a href=\"/Legacy:Mover\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Mover\">Mover</a>, and make the mover so that it only works in online\
      \ play. (Filtering <a href=\"/Legacy:Dispatcher\" title=\"Legacy:Dispatcher\"\
      >Dispatchers</a> is usually the best way of doing this.) Players arriving later\
      \ should be able to get into the combat area through this route, but no player\
      \ should be able to use it to escape from the combat area.</p>\n<blockquote\
      \ class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p><i>Examples:</i> The three most well-known instances\
      \ of this mechanic in the Unreal 1 maps are for the Titan in the Dark Arena,\
      \ the Titan in the Temple of Vandora, and the room in the Cellars at Dasa Pass\
      \ where you have to kill all the Krall before the doors will open again.</p>\n\
      </blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Advance_Starts\">Advance\

      Edit section: Advance Starts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>For those of you who are familiar with the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Mapping_For_AS\" title=\"Legacy:Mapping For AS\">Assault</a> gametype\
      \ in Unreal Tournament, you might want to take a cue from this style of mapping\
      \ if your level becomes a bit too large. In Assault, when certain objectives\
      \ are accomplished by the attacking team, a new set of PlayerStarts is turned\
      \ on while the original ones are turned off. The same principle holds true for\
      \ Coop. Nobody likes having to spend five minutes running through the empty\
      \ parts of a level just to get back up to where the action is taking place.</p>\n\
      <p><i>Errata: I have been informed that this does not seem to work in Coop for\
      \ either Unreal 1 or OldSkool Amp'd, for the simple reason that PlayerStarts\
      \ did not have bEnabled variables in Unreal 1. However, this will be possible\
      \ in the version of Coop that comes with Operation: Na Pali.</i></p>\n<blockquote\
      \ class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p><i>Counterexample:</i> In the Sunspire, if a player\
      \ dies after getting almost all the way up the tower, then the player respawns\
      \ back at the gate, and they have to run all the way over the ledge, back to\
      \ the door of the Sunspire itself, and then they have to work their way back\
      \ up through all the places where they had originally been. Most players find\
      \ this to be a major turnoff, especially when no one else is very close to completing\
      \ the level. This is the perfect example of what to avoid in a large coop-compatible\
      \ map.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Finale\">Finale</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_Unreal_Coop?section=6\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Finale\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Last but not least, do something for the end of your maps that makes them\
      \ a bit more coop-compatible. One problem with the stock Unreal maps is that\
      \ you can't do anything else with them after you get to the map with the final\
      \ cutscene. The server becomes entirely useless because it's just running a\
      \ cutscene map where nothing is happening. What I would suggest is to filter\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Teleporter\" title=\"Legacy:Teleporter\">Teleporters</a>\
      \ for standalone play and online play. The Teleporter at the end of your last\
      \ map for the SinglePlayer gametype will lead to a cutscene or whatever other\
      \ dynamic ending you have planned. On the other hand, the Teleporter at this\
      \ location for the Coop gametype might lead back to the very first map in your\
      \ pack.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\

      <p>So, this may look like a lot of information to go through, but most of it\
      \ is just common sense that's been given a bit of contemplation. Just as with\
      \ any mapping project, you have the final word as to what stays in your map\
      \ and what gets the axe. You know that you want people to enjoy playing your\
      \ SinglePlayer maps, and you don't want them to just play your maps once and\
      \ then never want to look at them again. Making your maps playable in Coop is\
      \ a definite plus when it comes to making a SinglePlayer map that can be enjoyed\
      \ over and over again.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_Topics\"\

      \ a bit too large.  In Assault, when certain objectives are accomplished by\
      \ the attacking team, a new set of PlayerStarts is turned on while the original\
      \ ones are turned off.  The same principle holds true for Coop.  Nobody likes\
      \ having to spend five minutes running through the empty parts of a level just\
      \ to get back up to where the action is taking place.  \n\n''Errata:  I have\
      \ been informed that this does not seem to work in Coop for either Unreal 1\
      \ or OldSkool Amp'd, for the simple reason that PlayerStarts did not have bEnabled\
      \ variables in Unreal 1.  However, this will be possible in the version of Coop\
      \ that comes with Operation: Na Pali.''\n\n{{innerbox|''Counterexample:''  In\
      \ the Sunspire, if a player dies after getting almost all the way up the tower,\
      \ then the player respawns back at the gate, and they have to run all the way\
      \ over the ledge, back to the door of the Sunspire itself, and then they have\
      \ to work their way back up through all the places where they had originally\
      \ been.  Most players find this to be a major turnoff, especially when no one\
      \ else is very close to completing the level.  This is the perfect example of\
      \ what to avoid in a large coop-compatible map.\n\n}}\n\n===Finale===\n\nLast\
      \ but not least, do something for the end of your maps that makes them a bit\
      \ more coop-compatible.  One problem with the stock Unreal maps is that you\
      \ can't do anything else with them after you get to the map with the final cutscene.\
      \ The server becomes entirely useless because it's just running a cutscene map\
      \ where nothing is happening.  What I would suggest is to filter [[Legacy:Teleporter|Teleporters]]\
      \ for standalone play and online play.  The Teleporter at the end of your last\
      \ map for the SinglePlayer gametype will lead to a cutscene or whatever other\
      \ dynamic ending you have planned.  On the other hand, the Teleporter at this\
      \ location for the Coop gametype might lead back to the very first map in your\
      \ pack.\n\n===Conclusion===\n\nSo, this may look like a lot of information to\
      \ go through, but most of it is just common sense that's been given a bit of\
      \ contemplation.  Just as with any mapping project, you have the final word\
      \ as to what stays in your map and what gets the axe.  You know that you want\
      \ people to enjoy playing your SinglePlayer maps, and you don't want them to\
      \ just play your maps once and then never want to look at them again.  Making\
      \ your maps playable in Coop is a definite plus when it comes to making a SinglePlayer\
      \ map that can be enjoyed over and over again.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Mapping\
