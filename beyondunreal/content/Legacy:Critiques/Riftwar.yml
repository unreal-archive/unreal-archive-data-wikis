      <p>Well, this was really supposed to be a proof of concept. I had originally\
      \ planned on spending no more than a week on it and ending up spending about\
      \ two and a half. It started out as just a three team piece, but the class-based\
      \ gameplay allowed me a workaround for the problems with two team skins, interactions,\
      \ etc. The team code in UT2003 isn't so much hard coded as just very assuming.\
      \ Much of the gametype code simply assumes you'd never try to have more than\
      \ two teams. And the team beacon code is native, which really throws me off.</p>\n\
      <p>If this was a mod project I was really fervent about, I would have taken\
      \ more time in preprod to plan things out and probably try and get a modeller\
      \ for some of the more custom aspects (like the Deathbot). In the end though,\
      \ I have enough material to split out some tutorials for other modders and put\
      \ new and better code into Freehold NG, which was the original intent. If along\
      \ the way the community finds Riftwar fun to play, to me that's just bonus material.</p>\n\
