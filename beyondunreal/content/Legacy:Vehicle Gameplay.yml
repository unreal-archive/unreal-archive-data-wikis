      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> The commentary should be removed, if not relevant to placing\
      \ vehicles and vehicle map design. Included information like number of passengers\
      \ and available weapons. Would like to see armor ratings and speed ratings.\
      \ Added To Do tag. Eventually, this should also include turrets and spacefighters.\
      \ Perhaps this should really be called, <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Vehicle_Placement?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Vehicle Placement (page does not exist)\">Vehicle\
      \ Placement</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Sweavo:</b> uh, so you first say that the nature\
      \ of the content should be changed, then say the title's off topic for what\
      \ you've just changed the content to? I thought this page was fine as was -\
      \ with high level info on the vehicles and how they may be used during gameplay.\
      \ This is useful stuff for the mapper who isn't all that experienced as a player.</p>\n\
      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> I say commentary is unecessary and distracting from valuable\
      \ info. I simply added to the subtopics that were here. I tried to clarify the\
      \ info, not change it. Then I suggest that the page title match the other Placement\
      \ topic pages like <a href=\"/Legacy:Placing_PlayerStart\" title=\"Legacy:Placing\
      \ PlayerStart\">Placing PlayerStart</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:Inventory_Item_Placement\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Inventory Item Placement\">Inventory Item Placement</a>, so\
      \ the page gets more use. When all is said and done, pages with more useful\
      \ info presented in the most reference-like way, get used more, linked more\
      \ and users get more out of them.</p>\n<p><b>Blip2:</b> I will see if i can\
      \ find vehicle armor etc. somewhere otherwise I'll generate it myself. I'll\
      \ also write the turrets/spacefighters bit and link it to the assault mapping\
      \ tutorial. I think the commentary should be left as it will surly help someone\
      \ whether they are a mapper or not...</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> The commentary\
      \ has already been removed. I think you mean the info should be left.</p>\n\

    text: "This page is a guide to help mappers place vehicles well in the map layout.\n\
      \n==Assault Vehicles (ASVehicle)==\n\nThese vehicles were introduced in UT2004\
      \ for the Assault gametype.\n\n===Turrets===\n\nThese are stationary gun turrets.\
      \  With the exception of the ASTurret_MiniGun, they are automatically controlled\
      \ to fire at enemy team members.\n\n===SpaceFighters===\n\nThese are flying\
      \ vehicles that do not depend on gravity.  They are meant to be launched with\
      \ the driver, as they have a minimum velocity setting.\n\n==Onslaught Vehicles\
      \ (ONSVehicle)==\n\nThese vehicles were introduced in UT2004 for the Onslaught\
      \ gametype.\n\n===WeaponPawns===\n\nThese are vehicle mounted weapons.  With\
      \ the exception of the Energy Turret, they are not placed in maps separately.\n\
      \n====ONSManualGunPawn \"Energy Turret\"====\n\nThis is a stationary turret\
      \ with twin laser cannons.  The gunner can zoom into targets for better accuracy.\n\
      \n* More effective : Long range, as defense in conjunction with other defenses\n\
      * Less effective : Out in the open\n* Pwns : Infantry, slow moving vehicles,\
      \ air vehicles.\n* Bane : Highly maneuverable vehicles, air strikes.\n\n===ChopperCraft===\n\
      \nThis is an aircraft that flies like a helicopter, capable of vertical flight\
      \ and hovering.\n\n====ONSAttackCraft \"Raptor\"====\n\nThe Raptor carries twin\
      \ blaster cannon mounted on the front and a flying vehicle homing rocket launcher.\
      \  The Raptor can also get to those hard-to-reach bonus items!  If mapping for\
      \ onslaught, a Raptor in base can be an invaluable way to come back from a tank\
      \ assault.\n\n* More effective : Against manta, goliath, other raptors\n* Less\
      \ effective : In the wide open\n* Pwns : Goliaths, Mantas\n* Bane : AVRiL, long-range\
      \ instant fire weapons\n\n====ONSDualAttackCraft \"Cicada\" (Editor's Choice\
      \ Bonus Pack)====\n\nThe Cicada carries a missile battery with two fire modes.\
      \  This vehicle carries one gunner passenger along with the driver.  The cicada\
      \ is a heavy, two-person helicopter-style aircraft.  It's chaotic to handle\
      \ but can deliver a convincing attack if given time to load its missile batteries,\
      \ It also has a large damage capacity and sustain a shell for a goliath.  If\
      \ a solitary pilot changes seats it stops in mid-air and becomes an effective\
      \ airborne turret. The turret's secondary fire fires a flare that draws AVRiL\
      \ rockets away for the vehicle (the raptor's homing rockets work on a engine\
      \ signature tracker rather than heat-seeking system and therefore the flares\
      \ will not work against them)\n\n* More effective : With some cover or element\
      \ of suprise\n* Less effective : In open areas\n* Pwns : Stantionary targets\n\
      * Bane : Raptors, Paladins\n\n===HoverCraft===\n\nThis vehicle floats above\
      \ the ground and is capable of hovering on both land and over water/lava/slime\
      \ volumes.\n\n====ONSHoverBike \"Manta\"====\n\nThis is a small hovercraft with\
      \ boost jump capability and twin blaster cannons mounted on the front.  The\
      \ Manta, though weak, is an excellent multipurpose tool in onslaught.  It's\
      \ good for thinning out infantry by running them over, and it's great for pursuing\
      \ other vehicles.  Although not designed to be a troop carrier, players be carried\
      \ as they stand on the props.\n\n* More effective : Somewhere it can swoop in\
      \ and get out of sight again quickly\n* Less effective : When highly visible\
      \ or in a corridor\n* Pwns : Infantry, less maneuverable vehicles\n* Bane :\
      \ AVRiL or Scorpion's web launcher, which destroys it in a single hit (if charged\
      \ more than half), Hellbender\n\n===TreadCraft===\n\nThis is a vehicle that\
      \ uses treads for mobility.  It is capable of rotating in place.\n\n====ONSHoverTank\
      \ \"Goliath\"====\n\nThis is a tank with a heavy cannon main turret and a small\
      \ machine gun turret on top.  This vehicle carries one gunner passenger along\
      \ with the driver.  The main cannon has be zoomed in for better accuracy.  The\
      \ main disadvantage of the Goliath is its speed and more importantly the main\
      \ cannon's turning speed. The driver recieves no damage while in the vehicle.\
      \  It is effective against all of the wheeled vehicles and in a tunnel it's\
      \ pretty much invincible.  It has a blind spot above and just behind it, where\
      \ a raptor or even a skillful player can position themselves and patiently destroy\
      \ the tank.\n\n* More effective : Choke points (tendancy to camp though) where\
      \ there is only one direction of attack (cannon turning speed)\n* Less effective\
      \ : Open areas with flying vehicles or mantas and where attacks can come from\
      \ above.\n* Pwns : Scorpion, Hellbender\n* Bane : Raptor, Manta\n\n====ONSHoverTank_IonPlasma\
      \ \"Ion Plasma Tank\"====\n\nThis is a tank with an ion plasma cannon main turret\
      \ and a (?) turret on top.  This vehicle carries one gunner passenger along\
      \ with the driver.  The main disadvantage is it's slow speed.  The ion plasma\
      \ weapon fire charges up and causes massive blast radius damage, similar to\
      \ the Levianthan alternate fire mode, with the refire rate just as slow.  It\
      \ is otherwise similar to the Goliath in terms of mobility and effectiveness.\n\
      \n* More effective : Choke points where there is only one direction of attack\
      \ (cannon turning speed and slow re-fire rate)\n* Less effective : Open areas\
      \ with flying vehicles or mantas and where attacks can come from above.\n* Pwns\
      \ : Scorpion, Hellbender\n* Bane : Raptor, Manta\n\n===WheeledCraft===\n\nThis\
      \ is a vehicle with wheels for mobility.  These vehicles are generally faster\
      \ than tread vehicles, but have a limited turning radius.\n\n====ONSPRV \"Hellbender\"\
      ====\n\nThis is a modified truck with a rear turret in the back and a small\
      \ turret in the passenger seat.  This vehicle holds two gunner passengers along\
      \ with the driver.  The rear turret causes chaos at long range when fired accurately\
      \ as it has the effect of 'pushing' vehicles.  The EMP cannon causes fatality\
      \ for all short range infantry due to the large splash damage when triggered.\
      \  The main weakness is its high driver/passenger damage.  If you take a direct\
      \ hit from a Goliath you're almost certain to be killed &ndash; even if the\
      \ jeep isn't destroyed &ndash; due to the large splash damage from the shell.\
      \  The safest position is manning the EMP turret then driver then rear turret\
      \ being the worst affected.  Unfortunately, this means that all vehicles except\
      \ the manta and scorpion can injure the occupants if the right moment and place\
      \ is chosen.\n\n* More effective : Choke points (tendency to camp though) and\
      \ areas where there will be players on foot.\n* Less effective : Open areas\
      \ when flying vehicles or larger wheeled vehicles are nearby\n* Pwns : Vehicles\
      \ at long range, infantry at medium\n* Bane : Goliath, flying vehicles\n\n====ONSRV\
      \ \"Scorpion\"====\n\nThis is a car with an open top and a roll cage with a\
      \ web gun turret on the top.  While fast and maneuverable, the Scorpion does\
      \ lack sufficient armor against large attacks.  The Scorpion's web gun will\
      \ home in on Manta's and is powerful enough to destroy one with one shot.\n\n\
      * More effective : Medium range, stationary targets\n* Less likely of success:\
      \ In open direct assault\n* Pwns : Infantry, Mantas\n* Bane : Goliath, flying\
      \ vehicles\n\n====ONSMobileAssaultStation \"Leviathan\"====\n\nThis is a huge\
      \ wheeled vehicle meant for heavy assault.  It carries a twin plasma main turret\
      \ and four twin pulse turrets.  The entire vehicle can transform into a stationary\
      \  Ion Plasma cannon turret, capable of inflicting great damage at long range\
      \ and with a large blast radius.  This vehicle carries four gunner passengers\
      \ along with the driver.  The main advantages of the leviathan are its awesome\
      \ firepower, including homing plasma fire, defensive pulse cannons, and Ion\
      \ cannon in its 'deployed' state.  The main disadvantages of the Leviathan are\
      \ its very slow speed and poor maneuverability.\n\n* More effective : Open areas\n\
      * Less effective : Long distance assaults\n* Pwns : Everything\n* Bane : Highly\
      \ maneuverable vehicles\n\n====ONSArtillery \"SPMA\" (Editor's Choice Bonus\
      \ Pack)====\n\nThis is a wheeled truck with a large artillery cannon in the\
      \ back.  The driver can either drive or fire the artillery cannon, using a remote\
      \ viewing pod.  Once a hovering SPMA camera pod is fired and set, the driver\
      \ can aim the artillery cannon.  The camera pod is vulnerable to any weapon\
      \ and has no armor but good visiblity is essential for defence of the vehicle\
      \ itself and for effective assault.  The SPMA also has a shock turret for a\
      \ passenger (identical to the Hellbender's) for close defence, though this rarely\
      \ gets used.  The SPMA is the fastest vehicle that doesn't fly or hover (and\
      \ it may be faster than a Cicada, but this is untested).  \n\n* More effective\
      \ : Behind large cover and near chokepoints (when timed effectivly).\n* Less\
      \ likely of success: In the open, at close range\n* Pwns: Stationary targets\n\
      * Bane: Any vehicles nearby or in the sky\n\n====ONSShockTank \"Paladin\" (Editor's\
      \ Choice Bonus Pack)====\n\nThis is a slow moving multi-axle vehicle with a\
      \ large pulse cannon turret and a shield generator mounted on the front. Holding\
      \ down alt-fire and pressing the primary fire creates a large electromagnetic\
      \ pulse within the shield's range.\n\n* More effective : During direct assault\n\
      * Less effective : Long range assault\n* Pwns : Stationary targets and anything\
      \ close range\n* Bane : More maneuverable vehicles\n\n==Related Topics==\n*\

      \ The commentary should be removed, if not relevant to placing vehicles and\
      \ vehicle map design.  Included information like number of passengers and available\
      \ weapons.  Would like to see armor ratings and speed ratings.  Added To Do\
      \ tag.  Eventually, this should also include turrets and spacefighters.  Perhaps\
      \ this should really be called, [[Legacy:Vehicle Placement|Vehicle Placement]].\n\
      \n'''Sweavo:''' uh, so you first say that the nature of the content should be\
      \ changed, then say the title's off topic for what you've just changed the content\
      \ to?  I thought this page was fine as was - with high level info on the vehicles\
      \ and how they may be used during gameplay.  This is useful stuff for the mapper\
      \ who isn't all that experienced as a player.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' I say commentary\
      \ is unecessary and distracting from valuable info.  I simply added to the subtopics\
      \ that were here.  I tried to clarify the info, not change it.  Then I suggest\
      \ that the page title match the other Placement topic pages like [[Legacy:Placing\
      \ PlayerStart|Placing PlayerStart]] and [[Legacy:Inventory Item Placement|Inventory\
      \ Item Placement]], so the page gets more use.  When all is said and done, pages\
      \ with more useful info presented in the most reference-like way, get used more,\
      \ linked more and users get more out of them.\n\n'''Blip2:''' I will see if\
      \ i can find vehicle armor etc. somewhere otherwise I'll generate it myself.\
      \ I'll also write the turrets/spacefighters bit and link it to the assault mapping\
      \ tutorial. I think the commentary should be left as it will surly help someone\
      \ whether they are a mapper or not...\n\n'''SuperApe:''' The commentary has\
      \ already been removed.  I think you mean the info should be left.\n\n'''Blip2:'''\
      \ lol ohh well - it's good as is then :D\n\n----\n\n[[:Category:Legacy Mapping]]\n\
