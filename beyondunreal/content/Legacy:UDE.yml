      \ but it was Epic's cat to let out of the bag, so... As stated in the chat with\
      \ Epic and NVidia last night (better formatted log from UnrealOps here) UT2004's\
      \ version of the UDE will be none other than a branded version of WOTgreal.\
      \ (great, now *I* get blamed for the bugs instead of DrSin&#160;:) ). It will\
      \ be pretty much the same as the current development version, just re-branded\
      \ as the UDE.</p>\n<p>So to clarify, though, WOTgreal still exists and will\
      \ continue to exist, Epic is just licensing a specific version of it. They won't\
      \ get any new versions with new features and whatnot, just bug fixes (let's\
      \ hope there aren't too many bugs that need fixing *crosses fingers*).</p>\n\
      <p>So I want to thank all those who have sent feature request and bug reports\
