      <p>This tutorial steps through a simple MilkShape modeling task, using the basic\
      \ tools for creation, selection and manipulation of the model and its components.\
      \ It describes the process of assigning materials in MilkShape 3D as a means\
      \ of preserving smoothing groups/hard edges when the objects are imported into\
      \ UEd 3 as static meshes. Export options that permit import into UEd3 are described.\
      \ Planar texture mapping is described.</p>\n<p>The object being modeled and\
      \ exported for use as a static mesh in UEd3 is a three-pointed blade weapon\
      \ similar to a shuriken or the Unreal razorjack ammo:</p>\n<div class=\"center\"\
