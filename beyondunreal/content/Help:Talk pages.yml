      \ aren't the ultimate answer to all communication needs. Especially individual\
      \ questions only semi-related to an article should better be asked on a related\
      \ forum. Almost all questions related to the Unreal Engine most likely receive\
      \ better responses on the [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/ BeyondUnreal Forums]\
      \ or the [http://forums.epicgames.com/ Epic Games Forums]. Of course you are\
      \ welcome to [[Help:Editing pages|add]] any knowledge derived from the answers\
      \ to related articles on the Unreal Wiki, or even [[Help:Starting a new page|start\
      \ new articles]] about the topic.\n\n[[Category:Help|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
