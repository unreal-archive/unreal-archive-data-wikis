      \ take long to realize just how open it was, allowing access to the code, easy\
      \ tools to make custom content of all kinds, etc. Started by creating a few\
      \ cutsom actors in each map for Unreal. Steadily these custom components began\
      \ to take over the designs of the maps. Always wanted to see how custom components\
      \ could effect gameplay in new and interesting ways.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>With\
      \ UT2004, it began with creating mutators, like the ROOtator and Flashlight\
      \ Mutator. Then forged on to a longer project, <b>Old Skool Monsta Toolz</b>,\
      \ which compiles several individual custom components into a mapping toolset\
      \ *and* new singleplayer / cooperative gametype, <b>OSM Adventure</b>. OSMT\
      \ is an add-on to the stock object tree in UT2004, offering many more options\
      \ for mappers who want to work with creatures or create story-driven adventures.\
      \ The OSMT project took took six months (and one video card) to complete. UPDATE:\
      \ Currently in a final round of development, OSMT v.1.5. A few new features\
      \ include flashlights, poison/antedotes, and a new fast-paced gameplay mutator,\
      \ OSM Populate, which places creatures, sometimes teams of creatures, in any\
      \ gametype map and does so at your configuration. This project will be in open\
      \ beta until it is done.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>You can find playable examples\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Concept\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\

      /Legacy:Gameplay\" title=\"Legacy:Gameplay\">Gameplay</a> and many different\
      \ bot play styles, based solely on the rules of the <a href=\"/Legacy:Gametype\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Gametype\">Gametype</a> played. Because I enjoyed the fact\
      \ that UT200x had so many gametypes, I wanted to see if a single layout could\
      \ potentially serve multiple gametypes and still be functional in terms of botplay,\
      \ balance, available strategy, fun, etc. This idea is <b>an All-Purpose map</b>,\
      \ one that can be released as with a \"DM-\" prefix, but simply be copied-pasted\
      \ as \"CTF-\", \"BR-\", \"DOM-\", and work fine. Also since this was my first\
      \ map in the Unreal Engine, I needed to succesfully create several basic map\
      \ elements like lifts, triggers, ladders, particles, dynamic lighting, etc.</p>\n\
      <p>In the end, I submitted four maps: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\"\
      \ href=\"http://unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=2362\"\
      >BR-BaseIck</a>, <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=2364\"\

      >DOM-BaseIck</a>. (This is in lieu of a working All-Purpose map, as descibed\
      \ above.) The maps are virtually identical, except for the GameObjective and\
      \ other game type-specific pieces.</p>\n<p>\"BaseIck\", obviously comes from\
      \ the map's original function and scope, which is pretty basic <a href=\"/Legacy:Map_Design\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Map Design\">Map Design</a>. But, the name BaseIck gave me\
      \ the idea for a theme of an old, out-of-fashion place with serious health and\
      \ safety issues. Conveniently, that would allow for rather simple design that\
      \ would still be in keeping with the theme. So, the introductory description\
      \ evolved into:</p>\n<p><i><b>This place hasn't seen a maintenance crew since\
      \ somebody smuggled in a Redeemer. The old geothermal power plants are a little\
      \ unstable now and the ventalation is shot, but you're welcome to use it. Sorry\
      \ about the smell.</b></i></p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Design\"\
      >Design</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/User:SuperApe?section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Design\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>As\
      \ this design was originally an All-Purpose map, it needed two sides of equal\
      \ strength; a symetrical map seemed the obvious choice. A requirement of BombingRun\
      \ is a third area equally reachable from both sides. The map started with three\
      \ large rooms.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Q: Why large? Don't you know that you'll ruin\
      \ your framerate?</dd>\n<dd>A: Yes, I'm aware of how painful it is to see a\
      \ beautiful panoramic view of a massive firefight, but only at 6 fps. My reasons\
      \ for large sized spaces within a map are based on the game engine itself. I\
      \ think about how far you can launch weapons like the Bio-Rifle or a Grenade.\
      \ I think about how far a player can fall without taking sizeable damage. I\
      \ think about the size of the explosion of the Redeemer. But, I also consider\
      \ the variety of gameplay a wider space offers; few things are as satisfying\
      \ as having to work for that LightningGun headshot with full zoom. Don't worry,\
      \ I'll try to keep the fps as high as possible.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>While on the\
      \ subject of spacial relationships, I'd like to point out a few things in BaseIck\
      \ that take advantage of the game engine space. The distance from the floor\
      \ of either the Blue or Red room to the catwalk opening nearest the Lightning\
      \ Gun is about the maximum vertical distance a standing player can shoot the\
      \ translocator. (about 1536 units) The distance from the floor of the catwalk\
      \ opening nearest the Power Plant to the top of the small mound nearest the\
      \ JumpPad is the maximum distance a standing player can fall without taking\
      \ damage. (about 368 units. I can only do it right half the time by walking\
      \ off the ledge, but bots do it consistenly.) A player at the lowest catwalk\
      \ opening, standing near the wall closest to the Lower Tunnels, can Dodge (Forward)\
      \ all the way to the Shock Rifle. (A similar Dodge spot from atop a large mount\
      \ in the Center Hall will allow you to reach the 'funnel' hole to the Lower\
      \ Tunnels.) A crouching player can still shoot over the barriers in the Center\
      \ Hall. (about 48 units) <i>(A discussion on this subject has started on <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:General_Scale_And_Dimensions\" title=\"Legacy:General Scale\
      \ And Dimensions\">General Scale And Dimensions</a>; Some things that might\
      \ be handy to know.)</i></p>\n<p>The next element I consider is <a href=\"/Legacy:Map_Flow\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Map Flow\">Map Flow</a>. To help understand well designed map\
      \ flow, I get Zen and kinda Feng Shui with it. While playtesting a map, I'll\
      \ be looking at the spaces I'm in and thinking about good entrances and exits.\
      \ The idea is to have more than one \"way in\" and one \"way out\" for each\
      \ spot in the map. That may sound way too simple, but I find it prevents situations\
      \ like a perfect sniper spot or a dead end. It makes sure that if you know where\
      \ your opponent is, you'll be able to choose between a frontal assault or a\
      \ sneaky back way (or more) no matter where he is in the map. Suprise attacks\
      \ abound in maps like this.</p>\n<p>Variety is a designer's best friend. So,\
      \ I knew that I wanted small spaces, long straights, twisty tunnels or mazes\
      \ to go along with my large rooms. And because it makes sense with many <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:GameObjective\" title=\"Legacy:GameObjective\">GameObjectives</a> I\
      \ also wanted a couple dead ends. (They usually kill map flow, but with proper\
      \ risk/reward balance they should be challenging instead of frustrating.)</p>\n\
      <p>Everybody talks about the <a href=\"/Legacy:Z-Axis\" title=\"Legacy:Z-Axis\"\
      >Z-Axis</a> but I hear very little said on the subject, if you get my drift.\
      \ Here's my take. You remember <u>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</u>? (<i>Of\
      \ couse, you do.</i>) You remember when Khan had the enterprise on the run and\
      \ they ducked into this space cloud that interferred with their sensors, effectively\
      \ blinding both ships? (<i>Uh-huh.</i>) You remember Spock's solution to their\
      \ dilemma?</p>\n<p><i><b>\"His pattern of movement suggests a two-dimensional\
      \ mode of thinking.\" –Spock</b></i></p>\n<p>They stop, lift up a bit, sneak\
      \ in close behind Khan and <b>blammo</b>! But, I digress.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately,\
      \ that is how I see players play (like Khan), that is how I see mappers map;\
      \ most of the time. I believe this can be overcome by allowing the variety in\
      \ your map to include the Z-Axis. Let's say, you're playtesting and you decide,\
      \ \"<i>This area needs a way out</i>\". Go ahead and consider the cardinal directions\
      \ (North, South,...), but don't forget to \"look up\", or down as in the case\
      \ of a good escape route. When considering cover (like walls, columns, barriers,\
      \ etc.), remember to think about players dodging vertical fire as well. Example:\
      \ A platform suspended in a room not only provides a base to stand on and collect\
      \ goodies, it also serves as a barrier from enemy fire down below; players can\
      \ shoot down and dodge. (and vice versa) And with vertical cover, you can even\
      \ hide from players who don't \"look up\".</p>\n<p>The Z-Axis considerations\
      \ can also be drawn from basic combat theory. The player above is the one with\
      \ the advantage, if for no other reason than he can jump down to meet an opponent\
      \ but his opponent can not jump up. (translocator notwithstanding) So I consider\
      \ higher places harder to reach, but more desirable places to be in combat.</p>\n\
      <p>There were other design considerations I let the game engine dictate. The\
      \ default sound levels of weapons, footsteps, etc. gave me good benchmarks for\
      \ setting levels on my own ambient and triggered sounds. The pure satisfaction\
      \ that can be found from the Karma Ragdoll physics led to strategic placement\
      \ of railings, beams and spaces between platforms. (<i>I love to play this game\
      \ with the 'Slow Motion Corpses' mutator on.</i>)</p>\n<p>Next, I considered\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Inventory_Item_Placement\" title=\"Legacy:Inventory Item\
      \ Placement\">Inventory Item Placement</a>. Of course, the nature and tactics\
      \ used with each weapon helped determine their placement (like placing the Flak\
      \ Cannon in twisting hallways for good bank shots, or the LightningGun near\
      \ a couple decent sniper spots), however I was not afraid to place weapons in\
      \ an unconventional area (like the Bio-Rifle in an open area). I figure part\
      \ of the fun of this game is learning to use the variety of weapons/fire modes\
      \ in all the variety of combat situations, so while you might want to use the\
      \ Bio-Rifle in a tighter space to take advantage of the splash effect, you'll\
      \ have to duck into the lower tunnels to do it on this map. Maybe then you realize\
      \ there's another way to use the Bio-Rifle, or you get more accurrate, or you\
      \ use another weapon, or you just run. I like that it could force players to\
      \ think a little.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Legacy:Gametype\" title=\"Legacy:Gametype\"\
      >Gametype</a>-specific design considerations were suprisingly few and far between.\
      \ A BombingRun touchdown traditionally results in the death of the scorer, so\
      \ why not have them just jump into lava? I notice bots will 'punt' a BombingRun\
      \ ball when they are distressed and near any ShootSpot, I ended up using that\
      \ in placing <a href=\"/Legacy:ShootSpot\" title=\"Legacy:ShootSpot\">ShootSpots</a>\
      \ for suprisingly interesting results. A Capture the Flag game is the only one\
      \ where bots need a return AssaultPath, I added a Straight one through the Center\
      \ Hall. I had best results working on the Deathmatch map, then copying it to\
      \ BR, DOM and CTF and adding in the unique elements. BombingRun took the longest;\
      \ more elements, some BSP changes and a custom touchdown effect. Capture the\
      \ Flag was the easiest; just add flags. After that I'd set the GameObjectiveTags\

      \ large \"end\" rooms, acending from the bottom (the lower tunnels) to the top\
      \ height of the map (the catwalks). I connect the catwalks directly to the \"\
      end\" room they surround at three points around the room. The third large room\
      \ sat above the lower tunnels and I connect them. I connect the third room directly\
      \ to the \"end\" rooms. I add a dead end space to the back wall of each \"end\"\
      \ room. (the bases)</p>\n<p>Big (vast) empty spaces need to be filled with usable\
      \ space. I place suspended platforms in the three large rooms. I add usable\
      \ cover to the floor of the large rooms as well in the form of mounds and barriers.</p>\n\
      <p>The two \"end\" rooms become the Red Room and Blue Room, with their respective\
      \ bases and catwalks. The third room becomes the Center Hall.</p>\n<p>Although\
      \ I add a few <a href=\"/Legacy:Zone_Portal\" title=\"Legacy:Zone Portal\">Zone\
      \ Portals</a> at this stage, I leave most of the other zoning work until the\
      \ end, when I can truely find the bad spots in the map (in terms of fps).</p>\n\
      <p>Yep, all those custom <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static\
      \ Mesh\">Static Meshes</a> were originally <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP\" title=\"\
      Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a>. (<i>Can you believe I was actually playtesting with all\
      \ that as BSP?</i>) Although a painful lesson to learn, I did see the difference\
      \ between BSP and meshes, first hand. (<i>UPDATE: For an excellent report of\
      \ <b>why</b>, look <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.unrealops.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Reviews&amp;file=index&amp;req=showcontent&amp;id=37\"\
      >here</a>. Thanks to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.angelmapper.com/\"\
      >Angel_Mapper</a>!</i>) And I was able to keep some elements BSP, if it didn't\
      \ hurt framerate or it looked horrible lighting-wise when I tried it as mesh.\
      \ <i>UPDATE: During later projects, I was able to use my experience in <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Maya\" title=\"Legacy:Maya\">Maya</a> to import custom static meshes\
      \ and eventually, custom <a href=\"/Legacy:Skeletal_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Skeletal\

      <p>Texturing? ... What texturing? Although it took me long enough, let's face\
      \ it: it ain't pretty. My main concern from the start was to use standard textures\
      \ to avoid installation problems for end users. Other than keeping the texture\
      \ scale reasonable and the direction (texture rotation) appropriate for nearby\
      \ light sources, I let the lighting and shadow do most of the talking, so to\
      \ speak.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Legacy:Lighting\" title=\"Legacy:Lighting\">Lighting</a>\
      \ was fun. Simple red and blue saturated lights (<i>notoriously tabboo, but\
      \ who cares?</i>) delineate the \"end\" rooms and a yellowish indoor lighting\
      \ fill the Center Hall. Simple local white lights fill the tunnels and catwalks.\
      \ Overall distance fog helped make the place look stuffy and humid from poor\
      \ ventalation. (However, I was disappointed to see how bright it made all the\
      \ little holes in the creases of BSP work. Could be used to find holes to fix,\
      \ though.)</p>\n<p>The dynamic lighting was kind of a pipe dream for a while.\
      \ I was very disappointed with the lack of BSP light occlusion with dynamic\
      \ lighting. But, I knew I needed the big effect for the map to be true to the\
      \ theme. I love the end result. And the \"lava lamp\" globe lights are a nice\
      \ bonus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Legacy:Sounds\" title=\"Legacy:Sounds\">Sounds</a>\
      \ were the most fun. I use the music from BR-Slaughter because it was the only\
      \ one that helped make the place \"smell bad\", if you get me. All the other\
      \ songs were way too clean and bombastic for this run-down stink hole. The sounds\
      \ helped all the platforms feel old and rickety. It made some of the tunnels\
      \ creak and I hope someone is listening intently for their foe when one of these\
      \ creaks catches them by suprise. Finally, the sounds needed to help give clues\
      \ to the map's secrets. They needed to consistently point to a reasonable structure\
      \ for the big effect and the other secrets in the map. I feel I was subtle,\
      \ but successful.</p>\n<p>I was used to working with particles like these in\
      \ Unreal and I had fun making really cool effects that ate fps like there was\
      \ no tomorrow. In the end, I managed to balance it pretty well by economizing\
      \ my <a href=\"/Legacy:Emitter\" title=\"Legacy:Emitter\">Emitters</a>. The\
      \ JumpPads, for example, needed enough particles to look like a quick puff of\
      \ steam, but I needed it to be able to trigger repeatedly and rapidly without\
      \ running out of particles. (Play Invasion and retreat via JumpPads and you'll\
      \ see why when the monsters jump after you in rapid succession.)</p>\n<p>The\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Trigger_Systems\" title=\"Legacy:Trigger Systems\">Trigger\
      \ Systems</a> were a source of some frustration, when it came to my trigger\
      \ door lock. The solution was as simple as a triggered door trigger that is\
      \ placed at the door itself. (<i>...simple, right?</i>)</p>\n<p><b>The big effect</b>\
      \ also needed a custom <a href=\"/Legacy:TriggerJumpPad\" title=\"Legacy:TriggerJumpPad\"\
      >TriggerJumpPad</a>. Tarquin and Foxpaw came to my aid and the result is nice.\
      \ (Thanks, folks!)&#160;:)</p>\n<p>Then, I worked on carefully <a href=\"/Legacy:Placing_PlayerStart\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Placing PlayerStart\">Placing PlayerStarts</a>. Now, one thing\
      \ about Team Deathmatch always bothered me: Players spawn randomly around the\
      \ map. This makes it difficult to group a squad and make use of your numbers.\
      \ You spend half your time just trying to get your Team together. Now the reason\
      \ is logistical: Deathmatch maps are rarely balanced and set up for Teams, so\
      \ PlayerStarts aren't owned by any Team, as opposed to other TeamGames like\
      \ CTF, DOM and BR. \"How can I get a Team Deathmatch game to spawn players on\
      \ the Team side?\", was one of my first questions here on UnrealWiki.</p>\n\
      <p>Foxpaw and Tarquin helped me to make my first custom actor: TeamSpawn. It\
      \ forces players of Team Deathmatch games to spawn only at PlayerStarts that\
      \ match their <a href=\"/Legacy:Team_Number\" title=\"Legacy:Team Number\">Team\
      \ Number</a>. (That actually came about from the GameTypeTrigger discussion;\
      \ they do kinda go hand-in-hand, as Foxpaw points out.)</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"\

      <li><b>Don't Ever Put Namespaces In Your Map Filenames</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The\
      \ original namespace in \"DM-Base Ick\" causes a Server to attempt to transfer\
      \ a 8.8MB file called, \"DM-Base\". Obviously, namespaces in map names are evil\
      \ and wrong. I understand they prevent Linux users as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Dynamic\
      \ Lighting in Online Play</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, I finally got to test this\
      \ map online. (Thanks, Sihunt!) Immediately, I see the dynamic flashing blue\
      \ lights in the catwalks are initially on. Of course, it's not supposed to do\
      \ that; it doesn't do it in offline play. Not sure why that happens. But that's\
      \ not the weird part. The strange thing is, when I go to those lights in the\
      \ catwalk, they reset to their proper off state upon line of sight. So, I'll\
      \ see the flashing lights until I round the corner and am in line of sight with\
      \ the (hidden) light actor. After I've gone thru both catwalks and \"seen\"\
      \ all the flashing light actors, the map behaves as it should. To me, that's\
      \ the weird part. Comments on past experiences with dynamic lighting, anyone?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Off-Kilter:</b> I'm no expert, but basically dynamic lighting is, for\
      \ all intents and purposes, broken. It has been suggested in various forums\
      \ to use Trigger Lights instead and just start them in the on state. Those,\
      \ from what I've read, work.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Yes, these are <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:TriggerLight\" title=\"Legacy:TriggerLight\">TriggerLights</a> initially\
      \ set to Off, not On. (They use dynamic lighting) I've heard / read / experienced\
      \ the same things about dynamic lighting being essentially broken, and to use\
      \ projectors instead. And I agree that for a lot of basic uses, dynamic lighting\
      \ just looks bad; that's why not *all* the lights go out during \"the big effect\"\
      . However, the dynamic lights can produce good results on basic lighting effects\
      \ if used with discretion, as demonstrated by BaseIck's <b>big effect</b>. I\
      \ think dynamic lighting has it's place. What does everyone else think?</p>\n\
      <p>(BTW, the name \"big effect\" is a bit tongue-in-cheek, as turning on/off\
      \ lights really should be one of the most basic lighting features in a 3D engine\
      \ as sophisticated as this one is. Yet, you rarely see lights shut off in maps.)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Uncommon:</b> Objects with bHidden=true (like Lights) don't get replicated\
      \ in a network game, so that could be related to the problem. You might try\
      \ setting DrawType=DT_None instead. Of course that could make them hard to find\
      \ and select in the editor, so you'd have to remember their names&#160;;) Another\
      \ approach might be to create a subclass of TriggerLight in the myLevel package,\
      \ with altered default properties.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Yes, the light actors\
      \ are invisible. Here's the problem that I saw in Online play: The blue-ish\
      \ flashy TriggerLights set to go off during <b>the big effect</b> are dynamic\
      \ lights that should stay dormant until triggered. I saw those lights acting\
      \ as though I had set them initially on (they aren't, and they don't act this\
      \ way offline) so I could see flashing blue lights coming from within the Catwalks.\
      \ Because these are dynamic lights, they shine straight through BSP-work. But,\
      \ when I walked up the Catwalk those lights would switch to their proper Off\
      \ state by themselves. I realized they switched back only when I had a line-of-sight\
      \ to the hidden TriggerLight actor. (I know where those lights are without the\
      \ actors visible.)</p>\n<p>So, my real questions about dynamic lights in online\
      \ play are mainly about other people's experiences using them. Bugs, pitfalls,\
      \ work-arounds, etc. I worked with them as best I could, trying to duplicate\
      \ the look of the normal lights by using multiple dynamic lights in different\
      \ positions and intensities. If you look in the Catwalks on BaseIck, you'll\
      \ see the light/tones cast from those look no different than the ones in the\
      \ Lower Tunnels, yet the light doesn't (visibly) shine through the BSP-work.\
      \ Anyone else see problems like the ones described above?</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ Having a lot more experience with <a href=\"/Legacy:Replication\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Replication\">Replication</a> now, I understand why my TriggerLights\
      \ weren't automatically set to off on Client machines. One day, I'll make a\
      \ custom TriggerLight that solves this little bug.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Dead Men\
      \ Tell Tales</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I worked for a time to give the bots a way\
      \ to the Redeemer. As mentioned, I finally decided not to give them the power\
      \ to do so on their own. This was decided in part due to the bots tenacious\
      \ nature. Their ability to go from the most powerful powerup in the map to the\
      \ biggest gun to the supershield, no matter how hidden or secret it is. Just\
      \ follow bots around in an unfamiliar map and you'll pick up all the secrets\
      \ and fruitful routes in no time. Bots give away secrets.</p>\n<p>But there's\
      \ another problem that proves to be a bigger secret killer to BaseIck. When\
      \ a player or bot is killed and Karma takes over, the Pawn's collision changes\
      \ with respect to movers. You've probably seen it more than a few times: a bot\
      \ you mowed down flies back through one of the sticky doors in Flux2, or falls\
      \ through a lift it was just riding on. It's annoying to see such a big bug\
      \ in an otherwise neato Engine.</p>\n<p>This problem proves devastating to BaseIck.\
      \ The Redeemer access is supposed to be secret. Even to spectators who can normally\
      \ fly through doors and lifts, the Redeemer can remain a secret because it is\
      \ tucked out of the way. But on several occasions during testing, a bot had\
      \ me cornered near the power plants and I responded in force, only to watch\
      \ the lifeless body fly through the access hatch, indicating to me and anyone\
      \ else watching (or dying) where the Redeemer is. At times, the bodies even\
      \ triggered the emergency hatch release and opened the door for me. Argh!</p>\n\
      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> Update: I don't know why I missed it, but Collision-&gt;bBlockKarma\
      \ seems to actually do this properly. I was checking to see if UT2k4 did Ragdoll\
      \ collision with movers, noticed that AS-Convoy (the big bridge that swings\
      \ around) does collide and I noticed that attribute set. When I double-checked\
      \ one of the lifts in BaseIck in UT2k3, it worked there too. (!) My only good\
      \ guess as to why the power plant door doesn't block Ragdolls is that the model\
      \ is not subdivided enough for proper collision; that Ragdolls slip thru the\
      \ Mover's mesh. BSP-&gt;Mesh work bites me in the a$$ again. Live and learn.</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li><b>That's too much occlusion!</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While working on\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Map_Optimization\" title=\"Legacy:Map Optimization\">Map\
      \ Optimization</a>, I had the opportunity to take each part of the map and optimize\
      \ step-by-step to see how much each helped framerate during testing. This included\
      \ taking large BSP decoration and coverting it to the imbedded mesh work. As\
      \ expected, conversion from even simple BSP objects to meshes significantly\
      \ increased the speed of the map (like 60%) while decreasing file size (like\
      \ 30%). However one piece didn't look good at all after Ued's conversion to\
      \ mesh: the large circular platforms in the bases. I decided to leave this piece\
      \ as BSP. To help with the framerates, I tried creating an anti-portal, just\
      \ like the ones used in the Center Hall platforms. It did occlude some of the\
      \ BSP faces of the spherical room, but to my suprise, it actually lowered the\
      \ frame rates. I removed the anti-portals and left the bases as BSP. The rooms\
      \ are simple enough that they only slightly impact framerate as BSP.</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li><b>If Jesus were my developer...</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>\"The big effect\"\
      </b> would just be the beginning. With repeated abuse, the power plants would\
      \ be unable to restart. And without power from those plants, the geothermal\
      \ forces that drive the base go unchecked and unregulated. What results would\
      \ be an overflow of the underground magma chambers from the bases, through the\
      \ main rooms and into the large pits. Lava would rise, crawl and flow in the\
      \ bases and main rooms until reaching the level just below the lower tunnels.\
      \ Only the mounds would be sticking up from the floor of the main room; cutting\
      \ off access to the base for an extended period of time; when the lava would\
      \ receed and drain. The entire base would become a steamy oven. Older pieces\
      \ of the base could break off, fall to the floor and crush.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>\"\

      \ meat, graceful as could be. This interesting behavior made me decide to keep\
      \ the crawlspace clear of paths, until I saw bot behavior that actually warranted\
      \ fixing. But I expected to see that behavior shortly.</p>\n<p>Several test\
      \ games later, playing Capture the Flag, I saw another bot who was in the crawlspace\
      \ under the platform. I didn't actually see this bot until I had boldly charged\
      \ into the enemy base, gibbed all defenders, grabbed the flag and was heading\
      \ out the base. At that moment, a little low on health but feeling good with\
      \ the flag, that bot sniped me in the back. It was hidden from sight, crouching\
      \ under the platform. And once again from my <i>DeathCam</i>, I saw the bot\
      \ merrily crawl out, leap up and return the flag without a hitch.</p>\n<p>I\
      \ saw bots use the crawlspace a dozen or more times. I saw suprising behavior\
      \ that just flat outweighed any problems with \"sticky\" bots. That particular\
      \ pathing bug is now officially a feature.</p>\n<p>Other behavior I was happy\
      \ to see bots doing on their own included intelligent use of all sniper positions\
      \ and ducking to use cover provided by mounds and barriers. I also expected\
      \ many more friendly fire deaths when squads are in the longer lower tunnels,\
      \ but these bots do pretty well.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> UPDATE: This beats\
      \ all! Today the very highly improbable happened: The bots got the Redeemer\
      \ on their own (and kicked butt)!</p>\n<p>I was just now playing Team Deathmatch\
      \ (4-on-4) in <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&amp;id=2361\"\
      >DM-BaseIck</a>. (I had just used our Blue Team's Redeemer half a minute earlier\
      \ and took out two) I was running with two Teammate bots towards the Lower Tunnels\
      \ when I saw something I honestly haven't seen in a long time, the Redeemer\
      \ model. I guess I was a little stunned because it took me and my two bot Teammates\
      \ out. (bots aren't ususally any good with the Redeemer)</p>\n<p>I was nowhere\
      \ <b>near</b> the Red Team's Redeemer, I didn't retrieve it at all that game.\
      \ The probablility of bots getting it on their own is very low because two key\
      \ events have to take place in rapid succession. One, a bot has to \"hack\"\
      \ the door lock (open it); which can probably only happen by being knocked into\
      \ the Trigger with a weapons blast. Two, a (different) bot has to open the door,\
      \ again probably by being knocked into it. (Door actor is set to Block when\
      \ closed, so I know they aren't \"trying\" to get it.)</p>\n<p>Now, I even though\
      \ I kept a <b>possible</b> path for bots to see the Redeemer (with help), I\
      \ thought I had disabled their ability to get to it. But, I suppose with as\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The following section spoils the two secrets of BaseIck:</p>\n\
      <p>1) The smuggled Redeemer can be found inside each power plant. Sounds made\
      \ by the plants suggest something is wrong; turns out they are running at half\
      \ power. The right side chamber is not running, due to the Redeemer spawn device\
      \ stuck inside. (The Tournament roadies have almost a third of the base powered\
      \ from their own generators.) By \"swiping\" the power plant's center control\
      \ panel, or running into it at a 45° angle left to right, you should be able\
      \ to hack into the otherwise inaccessible power plant controls and release the\
      \ door lock to the right side chamber for a few seconds. Open that door and\
      \ retrieve the Redeemer. (If caught inside the chamber, an emergency release\
      \ can be reached by double jumping.)</p>\n<p>The control panel button is a mover\
      \ with a very small collision radius; so small that the recessed control panel\
      \ almost makes it inaccessible. I wanted a button you really had to work on\
      \ to trigger, so that players are standing in a vulnerable spot (with their\
      \ backs to the action) for a while in order to get to the Redeemer. (risk vs\
      \ reward) It also allows causal collision with the panel without unlocking the\
      \ door. <i>Tip: If \"swiping\" the panel doesn't work, a Dodge move into the\
      \ panel should.</i></p>\n<p>2) The power plants are still unstable from previous\
      \ Redeemer explosions; this old base was never designed for such high power\
      \ weaponry. Power can be knocked out to nearly half the base with a Redeemer\
      \ hit to a power plant's control panel. This will not only shut off lights in\
      \ the catwalks and the main globe lights in the big rooms, but the jump pads\
      \ are also disabled until the Tournament roadies can bring the working half\
      \ of the power plant back online. (This is <b>\"the big effect\"</b>.)</p>\n\
      The disabled jump pads change the game flow in all BaseIck maps. Without a translocator,\
      \ the Keg o' Health is inaccessible, as are quick routes to the Center Hall\
      \ and the ammo cache near the power plant. Even a Redeemer inside the disabled\
      \ plant is inaccessible until power is restored. The team with the disabled\
      \ power plant is temporarily crippled.</div>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ short project represents another venture into mutli-actor modding. I started\
      \ with the idea of wanting to learn more about Projectors, and ended up developing\
      \ a system for implementing fairly realistic-looking flashlights in a multiplayer\
      \ map, including sophisticated bot support.</p>\n<p>The result of the project\
      \ was a simple map, aptly named SimpleMap, where I encorporate the actors I\
      \ had to develop to carry the effect of realistic flashlights. You can download\
      \ this SimpleMap and join the discussion on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\

      >Flashlight Mutator</a> on UnrealPlayground forums.</p>\n<p>The set of actors\
      \ used to pull this effect off varies from the Projector itself to the Display\
      \ Message needed to indicate to players how to turn the Flashlight on and off.\
      \ Here's the component list:</p>\n<pre>Actor\n  +- (Brush)\n  |  +- (Volume)\n\
      \  |     +- <b>DarkVolume</b>\n  +- (Info)\n  |  +- (LocalMessage)\n  |  | \
      \ +- (BulldogMessage)\n  |  |     +- <b>MessageFlashlight</b>\n  |  +- (Mutator)\n\
      \  |  |  +- <b>MutFlashlight</b>\n  |  +- (ReplicationInfo)\n  |     +- <b>FlashlightReplicationInfo</b>\n\
      \  +- (Light)\n  |  +- (TriggerLight)\n  |     +- <b>CoronaFlashlight</b>\n\
      \  +- (Projector)\n  |  +- (DynamicProjector)\n  |      +- <b>Flashlight</b>\n\
      \  +- (Triggers)\n     +- <b>ButtonFlashlight</b>\n</pre>\n<p>The ButtonFlashlight\
      \ is a simple trigger that follows the player and enables them to hit Use to\
      \ toggle the flashlight. MessageFlashlight is a simple message telling the player\
      \ to \"Hit Use to Toggle the Flashlight\". FlashlightReplicationInfo keeps things\
      \ running online. CoronaFlashlight provides a nice directional glare when players\
      \ with flashlight face the viewport. Flashlight is the actual projector which\
      \ travels with the player pawn and works with DarkVolume to help AIControllers\
      \ determine when to toggle the flashlight on or off. MutFlashlight is the mutator\
      \ that applies the Flashlight, ButtonFlashlight and CoronaFlashlight to each\
      \ player and cleans up flashlights when not needed.</p>\n<p>With this system,\
      \ maps are specifically designed with an area to be dark and a DarkVolume is\
      \ used to indicate that area to Bots. So, this is not an all-purpose stand-alone\
      \ mutator. The map must be designed with flashlights in mind. That's why I embed\
      \ each of these components in the virtual myLevel package in SimpleMap. Because\
      \ the flashlights are toggled via the Use key, this is not a good system to\
      \ implement in vehicle maps or vehicle gametypes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><span class=\"\

      <p>This is a project meant to help mappers implement complex Unreal-style monster\
      \ A.I. in any gametype. It comprises a toolset of mapping tools and a new set\
      \ of ScriptedMonsters that mimic the old <a href=\"/Legacy:ScriptedPawn\" title=\"\
      Legacy:ScriptedPawn\">ScriptedPawn</a> AI from UT99. It also contains a new\
      \ story-driven gametype Old Skool Monsta Adventure (OSM). This project is in\
      \ development at UnrealPlayground and has been publicly available since July\
      \ 2006. OSM maps by some of my favorite mappers are available at the <a rel=\"\

      \ new OSM Adventure gametype can be implemented. OSM mappers are encouraged\
      \ to reverse-engineer it for reference. This is a single player map that features\
      \ a story that leads the players to enter an ancient tomb. Once inside, three\
      \ different routes are available to players, each one emphasizing a different\
      \ important element of OSM Adventure: Puzzle, Trap or Monster. This is meant\
      \ to add some replay value for players as well as demonstrate to mappers various\
      \ ways these three elements can be combined for interest. At the end of each\
      \ route, the player will find themselves at the final battle area, where the\
      \ story wraps up and the biggest challenge is presented. Finally a short ending\
      \ cutscene completes the adventure.</p>\n<p>This is by far the most complete\
      \ and <i>prettiest</i> map I've made in any game engine. I'm reasonably proud\
      \ of the visuals as well as the technical elements, as I normally concentrate\
      \ more on the gameplay and technical aspects of my maps. It may not be the ultimate\
      \ map ever, but I had fun developing it concurrently with the Old Skool Monsta\
      \ Toolz toolset. Comments on this map are welcome <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\

      \ iv been reading alot about your OSMT and was hoping youd let me use the tool\
      \ for my mod. id like to talk to you more about what is required in my game\
      \ and how much your tool could help me. one of my question is how good is your\
      \ NPC/monster AI compare to what is provided with UT2004. i know youve worked\
      \ realy hard to get this tool even starting back in the 80's if im correct.\
      \ so i understand the pride in your work if you let me use it or not. i dont\
      \ think i will ever release my mod publically though so i hope that for some\
      \ reason allow you to let me to use it.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> I understand.\
      \ To get in touch with me, and others using OSMT, and to continue any substantial\
      \ discussions on use and distribution, you can find me on <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://unrealplayground.com/forums/\">UnrealPlayground\
      \ Forums</a>. There's an <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"\
      http://unrealplayground.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=172\">OSMT subforum</a>\
      \ with lots of info and that's a good place to discuss this, or you can Personal\
      \ Message (PM) me there. That's normally the most reliable way to get in touch\
      \ with me, aside from my contact info above. And, while I've been fiddling with\
      \ games since before the 80's, I've only developed OSMT in the last year and\
      \ a half.</p>\n<p><b>fleshsniper1:</b> thanks, i sure will do that</p>\n<p><b>PiX</b>\
      \ any chance one could get a hold on that custom keycard class of yours? If\
      \ so, would you please send an email to me? <i>(email removed to save you from\
      \ spam)</i></p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Sorry, the team keycard for VCTF-TerraForma\
      \ was not completed (along with that entire map). If I revisit the map and that\
      \ item again, I'll let you know.</p>\n<p><b>PiX</b> Alright. Do you know of\
      \ any other custom script that might do the job? Oh, and that's my spam-address,\
      \ so that's ok.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> What does this keycard entail? If you're\
      \ wanting to let only certain teams into an area, I'm sure that can be done\
      \ easilly with a scripted trigger. If you wanted something more along the lines\
      \ of a player having to pick up a 'keycard' to be able to open certain doors,\
      \ you can have one class that is that 'keycard' and when the player touches\
      \ it, have it add the players pawn onto to a list that would reside in a custom\
      \ mover or whatever. Then when the player would go to open said mover, the mover\
      \ would first check to see if that particular player was on the 'list' of those\
      \ with a keycard and if they are, it opens. It sounds less messier than dealing\
      \ with an inventory class.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Any lengthy discussion might\
      \ be better served elsewhere, so I'll try to be brief. PiX, I don't know of\
      \ any other system that does this, but you can try searching for Team-based\
      \ tools for CTF/VCTF. Many ways of using stock methods for blocking or limiting\
      \ by team can be \"clunky\" and/or compromised in unintentional ways; making\
      \ it messy to map with. In response to Myth, I've explored many methods of team\
      \ blocking using stock actors and trigger systems. Your second description of\
      \ what the TeamDoors/Keycard system is meant to be in VCTF-TerraForma is close,\
      \ but if you review the description I give above and/or follow the link there\
      \ to the UnrealPlayground forum thread on this map, I give at least one important\
      \ feature, \"you can pick one up from a dead opponent.\" This is crucial to\
      \ the gameplay mechanic, as it is a designed way to infiltrate the opponent's\
      \ gatehouse, outpost, etc. But, futher details are classified. Rest assurred\
      \ since I put this map down, I've had a lot more experience in UScript development\
      \ and should be able to put this together without much trouble.</p>\n\n<!--\

    text: "==SuperApe==\n\n===Who dat?===\n: Glenn Storm, an UnrealWiki user with\
      \ interests in game design, map design and artificial intelligence.\n\n===Short\
      \ Biography===\n: A game designer, animator, story developer and general tinkering\
      \ monkey.  An Unreal community contributor for years before becoming a professional\
      \ game designer, and after working for many years as an animator in feature\
      \ films and making games as a hobby since early childhood.\n\n====Game Design\
      \ Experience====\n: 'Have always made games, simple or complex, each game came\
      \ from imagining something fun to do, some puzzle, struggle or adventure that\
      \ would engage the player.  Board games, role-playing games, choose-your-own-adventure\
      \ type games, strategy games, word games, drinking games (in college), etc.\
      \  This started while very young; having a good imagination, plenty of playtime\
      \ and an inherent need to organize the design into a workable, playable, fun\
      \ game.\n\n: This game design enthusiast and programming hobbyist has made computer\
      \ games since grade school.  \n\n: A professional game designer since March\
      \ 2007.\n* 1983, Commodore PET, top-down Tron Lightcycle game with an ASCII\

      \ play through them with a 2D ASCII-style gui interface.  Used AppleBASIC. ''(I\
      \ still have the program printed out and stored somewhere around the house.\
      \  Maybe I should convert it to a Flash game.)''\n* 1999, PC, a 2D turn-based\
      \ strategy game based on a (turn-based strategy) board game that was developed\
      \ in college. (~1991)  Full sound, GUI interface, computer opponent AI, & animation.\
      \ Used QuickBasic. (compiled to an .exe)\n* 2001, PC, a 3D engine prototype\
      \ for a raster-looking hover ship racing game in tunnels. 'Made this to figure\
      \ out the problems of displaying and working with 3D, but it was way too slow\
      \ to display more than raster lines. Used QuickBasic. (compiled to an .exe)\n\
      * 2005, Web (Flash), a very simple shooting gallery game with a humorous twist.\
      \  'Just wanted to explore Flash's capabilities and ActionScript language. \
      \ Used Flash. ('''[http://glennstorm.com/legacy/flashGallery/flashgal.htm Flash\

      \ written in JavaScript, including an in-browser console and object viewer.\
      \ It's a component-based architecture with only a few UI, Input and lower level\
      \ Engine features complete, but it was enough to decide to turn away from HTML5\
      \ development for now, in favor of more 3D game development in higher level\
      \ programming languages. See the two tech demos: '''[http://hotironproductions.com/AJSGT/\

      \ includes Doom I & II, Quake I & II, Duke Nukem, and Interstate '76.  (<&ndash;\
      \ yes, mapping for a vehicle combat game)  A few of those maps got published.\
      \  '''\"bludsprt\"''', or BloodSport, is a Doom2 map that comes to mind.  It's\
      \ in both the <u>Tricks of the Game (& Doom) Programming Gurus</u> books that\
      \ came with CDRoms put out by SAMS publishing.  It's also available at [http://www.gamers.org/pub/idgames/levels/doom2/deathmatch/a-c/\
      \ gamers.org] and [http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=1431 Doomworld].\
      \  '''\"bathal\"''', or The Royal Hall of Battle, is Quake1 map you can still\
      \ find on [http://www.gamers.org/pub/idgames2/levels/deathmatch/a-c/ gamers.org].\
      \  '''\"madhaus\"''', or Mad House Mayhem is another Quake1 map available [http://ftp.se.kde.org/pub/pc/games/idgames2/levels/deathmatch/m-o/\
      \ here].  '''\"TagArena\"''', one of a few custom DukeTag maps for duke3d, can\
      \ still be found [http://rtcm.thecomitatus.com/knowledge-base/downloads-rtcm/duke3d-maps/\
      \ online].  '''\"Clone Canyon Speedway\"''' and '''\"Ed's Farm\"''' are two\
      \ Interstate '76 Nitro maps exclusively available at [http://host109.ipowerweb.com/~bigwhite/interstate76/lsm/combat1/no3comb1.htm\
      \ Lightfoot's Stolen Maps].  Other maps I have made have either not been published,\
      \ uploaded or I simply forgot their filenames.\n\n: Found UT2003 in the store\
      \ one day and saw it came with the editor.  Sold.  It didn't take long to realize\
      \ just how open it was, allowing access to the code, easy tools to make custom\
      \ content of all kinds, etc.  Started by creating a few cutsom actors in each\
      \ map for Unreal.  Steadily these custom components began to take over the designs\
      \ of the maps.  Always wanted to see how custom components could effect gameplay\
      \ in new and interesting ways.\n\n: With UT2004, it began with creating mutators,\
      \ like the ROOtator and Flashlight Mutator.  Then forged on to a longer project,\
      \ '''Old Skool Monsta Toolz''', which compiles several individual custom components\
      \ into a mapping toolset *and* new singleplayer / cooperative gametype, '''OSM\
      \ Adventure'''.  OSMT is an add-on to the stock object tree in UT2004, offering\
      \ many more options for mappers who want to work with creatures or create story-driven\
      \ adventures.  The OSMT project took took six months (and one video card) to\
      \ complete.  UPDATE: Currently in a final round of development, OSMT v.1.5.\
      \  A few new features include flashlights, poison/antedotes, and a new fast-paced\
      \ gameplay mutator, OSM Populate, which places creatures, sometimes teams of\
      \ creatures, in any gametype map and does so at your configuration.  This project\
      \ will be in open beta until it is done.\n\n: You can find playable examples\

      \n===With the Unreal Engine?===\n; Make maps that concentrate on good gameplay\
      \ design. : This is a great editor compared to most map editors I've used. \
      \ After I finished my first map \"BaseIck\", I posted it on UnrealPlayground\
      \ and others.    It was meant to address most of the design problems I'm interested\
      \ in.  ONS-MudSling & ONS-Mudsling][, for UT2004, are available from UnrealPlayground\
      \ as well.  VCTF-TerraForma is still in beta and sitting on the shelf.  My latest\
      \ released map is OSM-Gauntlet an example map for the new OSM Adventure gametype\
      \ I introduced with [[User:SuperApe/Old_Skool_Monsta_Toolz|Old Skool Monsta\
      \ Toolz]].\n\n; Interested in game AI since it reached a believable level. :\
      \ That means, ReaperBots for Q1.  Of which the Unreal bots are not-so-distant\
      \ cousins. (Steve Polge)  Anyway, this means I tweak pathnodes and spectate\
      \ a lot of bot only games.  Sounds weird to most people.  I've delved into custom\
      \ AI constructs with the ROOs, Kangaroo NPCs. (see ROOs section below)  I've\
      \ worked extensively on monster AI for the Old Skool Monsta Toolz add-on. (see\
      \ the Old Skool Monsta Toolz section below)  Now that I work in game design\
      \ professionally, I receive opportunities to work on a much wider variety of\
      \ AI than multiplayer Bots.  This is addition to my general interest in artificial\
      \ intelligence, including experiments in artificial evolution in gaming, which\
      \ I have believed for a long time the Unreal Engine could help to demonstrate.\n\
      \n; Modifying the engine. : I've made quite a few custom actors for just about\
      \ every map I've released. ''(I like to offer a different gameplay experience\
      \ in each map I make)''  After that, I began working with Mutators, like [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=36679\
      \ The ROOtator].  This project combined modeling and animation with AI coding\
      \ and game programming.  With that under my belt, I started a project to create\
      \ an entire set of mapping toolz, designed to help mappers implement Monsters\
      \ with complex AI in any gametype.  This project is called [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Old_Skool_Monsta_Toolz|Old\
      \ Skool Monsta Toolz]] and this small package includes a custom gametype, [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Mapping_For_OSM_Adventure|OSM\
      \ Adventure]], capable of single player and cooperative adventures with a storytelling\
      \ emphasis.  Old Skool Monsta Toolz is now available as a free download.\n\n\
      ; Using some high-end animation experience from working in feature animated\
      \ films. : I've been both a 3D character animator and an effects animator. \
      \ Unreal's skeletal animation system is similar to many 3D animation packages\
      \ and I'm able to have fun creating a variety of player and non-player characters.\
      \  The unreal engine allows many of the same particle systems, physics emulations,\
      \ etc. that I'm used to.  I've had fun using of them in my maps and mods.\n\n\
      ; Work in game development using skills as an Animator, Story Artist, Game Designer,\

      \ collaborative art form: Feature Animation, combined with my passion and experience\
      \ designing and creating gameplay experiences in a wide variety of settings.\
      \  It seems that it could be a matter of meeting a producer who's willing to\

      ''(use the show/hide button here to see the full development post-mortem)''\n\
      <div class=\"hidden-block\"><span class=\"hint\"></span><div class=\"hidden\"\
      >\n\n====Concept====\n\nThe idea was to design a map capable of great [[Legacy:Gameplay|Gameplay]]\
      \ and many different bot play styles, based solely on the rules of the [[Legacy:Gametype|Gametype]]\
      \ played.  Because I enjoyed the fact that UT200x had so many gametypes, I wanted\
      \ to see if a single layout could potentially serve multiple gametypes and still\
      \ be functional in terms of botplay, balance, available strategy, fun, etc.\
      \  This idea is '''an All-Purpose map''', one that can be released as with a\
      \ \"DM-\" prefix, but simply be copied-pasted as \"CTF-\", \"BR-\", \"DOM-\"\
      , and work fine.  Also since this was my first map in the Unreal Engine, I needed\
      \ to succesfully create several basic map elements like lifts, triggers, ladders,\
      \ particles, dynamic lighting, etc.\n\nIn the end, I submitted four maps: [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=2362\
      \ BR-BaseIck], [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=2364\
      \ CTF-BaseIck], [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=2361\
      \ DM-BaseIck] and [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=2367\
      \ DOM-BaseIck].  (This is in lieu of a working All-Purpose map, as descibed\
      \ above.)  The maps are virtually identical, except for the GameObjective and\
      \ other game type-specific pieces.\n\n\"BaseIck\", obviously comes from the\
      \ map's original function and scope, which is pretty basic [[Legacy:Map Design|Map\
      \ Design]].  But, the name BaseIck gave me the idea for a theme of an old, out-of-fashion\
      \ place with serious health and safety issues.  Conveniently, that would allow\
      \ for rather simple design that would still be in keeping with the theme.  So,\
      \ the introductory description evolved into:\n\n'''''This place hasn't seen\
      \ a maintenance crew since somebody smuggled in a Redeemer.  The old geothermal\
      \ power plants are a little unstable now and the ventalation is shot, but you're\
      \ welcome to use it.  Sorry about the smell.'''''\n\n====Design====\n\nAs this\
      \ design was originally an All-Purpose map, it needed two sides of equal strength;\
      \ a symetrical map seemed the obvious choice.  A requirement of BombingRun is\
      \ a third area equally reachable from both sides.  The map started with three\
      \ large rooms.\n\n: Q: Why large?  Don't you know that you'll ruin your framerate?\n\
      : A: Yes, I'm aware of how painful it is to see a beautiful panoramic view of\
      \ a massive firefight, but only at 6 fps.  My reasons for large sized spaces\
      \ within a map are based on the game engine itself.  I think about how far you\
      \ can launch weapons like the Bio-Rifle or a Grenade.  I think about how far\
      \ a player can fall without taking sizeable damage.  I think about the size\
      \ of the explosion of the Redeemer.  But, I also consider the variety of gameplay\
      \ a wider space offers; few things are as satisfying as having to work for that\
      \ LightningGun headshot with full zoom.  Don't worry, I'll try to keep the fps\
      \ as high as possible.  \n\nWhile on the subject of spacial relationships, I'd\
      \ like to point out a few things in BaseIck that take advantage of the game\
      \ engine space.  The distance from the floor of either the Blue or Red room\
      \ to the catwalk opening nearest the Lightning Gun is about the maximum vertical\
      \ distance a standing player can shoot the translocator. (about 1536 units)\
      \  The distance from the floor of the catwalk opening nearest the Power Plant\
      \ to the top of the small mound nearest the JumpPad is the maximum distance\
      \ a standing player can fall without taking damage. (about 368 units.  I can\
      \ only do it right half the time by walking off the ledge, but bots do it consistenly.)\
      \  A player at the lowest catwalk opening, standing near the wall closest to\
      \ the Lower Tunnels, can Dodge (Forward) all the way to the Shock Rifle. (A\
      \ similar Dodge spot from atop a large mount in the Center Hall will allow you\
      \ to reach the 'funnel' hole to the Lower Tunnels.)  A crouching player can\
      \ still shoot over the barriers in the Center Hall. (about 48 units)  ''(A discussion\
      \ on this subject has started on [[Legacy:General Scale And Dimensions|General\
      \ Scale And Dimensions]]; Some things that might be handy to know.)''\n\nThe\
      \ next element I consider is [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]].  To help understand\
      \ well designed map flow, I get Zen and kinda Feng Shui with it.  While playtesting\
      \ a map, I'll be looking at the spaces I'm in and thinking about good entrances\
      \ and exits.  The idea is to have more than one \"way in\" and one \"way out\"\
      \ for each spot in the map.  That may sound way too simple, but I find it prevents\
      \ situations like a perfect sniper spot or a dead end.  It makes sure that if\
      \ you know where your opponent is, you'll be able to choose between a frontal\
      \ assault or a sneaky back way (or more) no matter where he is in the map. \
      \ Suprise attacks abound in maps like this.\n\nVariety is a designer's best\
      \ friend.  So, I knew that I wanted small spaces, long straights, twisty tunnels\
      \ or mazes to go along with my large rooms.  And because it makes sense with\
      \ many [[Legacy:GameObjective|GameObjective]]s I also wanted a couple dead ends.\
      \ (They usually kill map flow, but with proper risk/reward balance they should\
      \ be challenging instead of frustrating.)\n\nEverybody talks about the [[Legacy:Z-Axis|Z-Axis]]\
      \ but I hear very little said on the subject, if you get my drift.  Here's my\
      \ take.  You remember <u>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</u>? (''Of couse, you\
      \ do.'')  You remember when Khan had the enterprise on the run and they ducked\
      \ into this space cloud that interferred with their sensors, effectively blinding\
      \ both ships? (''Uh-huh.'')  You remember Spock's solution to their dilemma?\n\
      \n'''''\"His pattern of movement suggests a two-dimensional mode of thinking.\"\
      \ &ndash;Spock'''''\n\nThey stop, lift up a bit, sneak in close behind Khan\
      \ and '''blammo'''!  But, I digress.\n\nUnfortunately, that is how I see players\
      \ play (like Khan), that is how I see mappers map; most of the time.  I believe\
      \ this can be overcome by allowing the variety in your map to include the Z-Axis.\
      \  Let's say, you're playtesting and you decide, \"''This area needs a way out''\"\
      .  Go ahead and consider the cardinal directions (North, South,...), but don't\
      \ forget to \"look up\", or down as in the case of a good escape route.  When\
      \ considering cover (like walls, columns, barriers, etc.), remember to think\
      \ about players dodging vertical fire as well.  Example: A platform suspended\
      \ in a room not only provides a base to stand on and collect goodies, it also\
      \ serves as a barrier from enemy fire down below; players can shoot down and\
      \ dodge. (and vice versa)  And with vertical cover, you can even hide from players\
      \ who don't \"look up\".\n\nThe Z-Axis considerations can also be drawn from\
      \ basic combat theory.  The player above is the one with the advantage, if for\
      \ no other reason than he can jump down to meet an opponent but his opponent\
      \ can not jump up. (translocator notwithstanding)  So I consider higher places\
      \ harder to reach, but more desirable places to be in combat.\n\nThere were\
      \ other design considerations I let the game engine dictate.  The default sound\
      \ levels of weapons, footsteps, etc. gave me good benchmarks for setting levels\
      \ on my own ambient and triggered sounds.  The pure satisfaction that can be\
      \ found from the Karma Ragdoll physics led to strategic placement of railings,\
      \ beams and spaces between platforms. (''I love to play this game with the 'Slow\
      \ Motion Corpses' mutator on.'')  \n\nNext, I considered [[Legacy:Inventory\
      \ Item Placement|Inventory Item Placement]].  Of course, the nature and tactics\
      \ used with each weapon helped determine their placement (like placing the Flak\
      \ Cannon in twisting hallways for good bank shots, or the LightningGun near\
      \ a couple decent sniper spots), however I was not afraid to place weapons in\
      \ an unconventional area (like the Bio-Rifle in an open area).  I figure part\
      \ of the fun of this game is learning to use the variety of weapons/fire modes\
      \ in all the variety of combat situations, so while you might want to use the\
      \ Bio-Rifle in a tighter space to take advantage of the splash effect, you'll\
      \ have to duck into the lower tunnels to do it on this map.  Maybe then you\
      \ realize there's another way to use the Bio-Rifle, or you get more accurrate,\
      \ or you use another weapon, or you just run.  I like that it could force players\
      \ to think a little.  \n\n[[Legacy:Gametype|Gametype]]-specific design considerations\
      \ were suprisingly few and far between.  A BombingRun touchdown traditionally\
      \ results in the death of the scorer, so why not have them just jump into lava?\
      \  I notice bots will 'punt' a BombingRun ball when they are distressed and\
      \ near any ShootSpot, I ended up using that in placing [[Legacy:ShootSpot|ShootSpot]]s\
      \ for suprisingly interesting results.  A Capture the Flag game is the only\
      \ one where bots need a return AssaultPath, I added a Straight one through the\
      \ Center Hall.  I had best results working on the Deathmatch map, then copying\
      \ it to BR, DOM and CTF and adding in the unique elements.  BombingRun took\
      \ the longest; more elements, some BSP changes and a custom touchdown effect.\
      \  Capture the Flag was the easiest; just add flags.  After that I'd set the\
      \ GameObjectiveTags for the AssaultPaths.  That's about it.\n\n====Construction====\n\
      \nThose design elements in mind, I connect the two \"end\" rooms with long corridors,\
      \ I connect the long corridors with a small network of twisting tunnels. (the\
      \ lower tunnels)  I add passages that lead around these large \"end\" rooms,\
      \ acending from the bottom (the lower tunnels) to the top height of the map\
      \ (the catwalks).  I connect the catwalks directly to the \"end\" room they\
      \ surround at three points around the room.  The third large room sat above\
      \ the lower tunnels and I connect them.  I connect the third room directly to\
      \ the \"end\" rooms.  I add a dead end space to the back wall of each \"end\"\
      \ room. (the bases)\n\nBig (vast) empty spaces need to be filled with usable\
      \ space.  I place suspended platforms in the three large rooms.  I add usable\
      \ cover to the floor of the large rooms as well in the form of mounds and barriers.\n\
      \nThe two \"end\" rooms become the Red Room and Blue Room, with their respective\
      \ bases and catwalks.  The third room becomes the Center Hall.\n\nAlthough I\
      \ add a few [[Legacy:Zone Portal|Zone Portal]]s at this stage, I leave most\
      \ of the other zoning work until the end, when I can truely find the bad spots\
      \ in the map (in terms of fps). \n\nYep, all those custom [[Legacy:Static Mesh|Static\
      \ Mesh]]es were originally [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]]. (''Can you believe I was actually\
      \ playtesting with all that as BSP?'')  Although a painful lesson to learn,\
      \ I did see the difference between BSP and meshes, first hand. (''UPDATE: For\
      \ an excellent report of '''why''', look [http://www.unrealops.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Reviews&file=index&req=showcontent&id=37\
      \ here].  Thanks to [http://www.angelmapper.com/ Angel_Mapper]!'') And I was\
      \ able to keep some elements BSP, if it didn't hurt framerate or it looked horrible\
      \ lighting-wise when I tried it as mesh.  ''UPDATE: During later projects, I\
      \ was able to use my experience in [[Legacy:Maya|Maya]] to import custom static\
      \ meshes and eventually, custom [[Legacy:Skeletal Mesh|Skeletal Mesh]]es for\
      \ custom characters and complex props.''\n\nTexturing? ... What texturing? \
      \ Although it took me long enough, let's face it: it ain't pretty.  My main\
      \ concern from the start was to use standard textures to avoid installation\
      \ problems for end users.  Other than keeping the texture scale reasonable and\
      \ the direction (texture rotation) appropriate for nearby light sources, I let\
      \ the lighting and shadow do most of the talking, so to speak.\n\n[[Legacy:Lighting|Lighting]]\
      \ was fun.  Simple red and blue saturated lights (''notoriously tabboo, but\
      \ who cares?'') delineate the \"end\" rooms and a yellowish indoor lighting\
      \ fill the Center Hall.  Simple local white lights fill the tunnels and catwalks.\
      \  Overall distance fog helped make the place look stuffy and humid from poor\
      \ ventalation. (However, I was disappointed to see how bright it made all the\
      \ little holes in the creases of BSP work.  Could be used to find holes to fix,\
      \ though.)\n\nThe dynamic lighting was kind of a pipe dream for a while.  I\
      \ was very disappointed with the lack of BSP light occlusion with dynamic lighting.\
      \  But, I knew I needed the big effect for the map to be true to the theme.\
      \  I love the end result.  And the \"lava lamp\" globe lights are a nice bonus.\n\
      \n[[Legacy:Sounds|Sounds]] were the most fun.  I use the music from BR-Slaughter\
      \ because it was the only one that helped make the place \"smell bad\", if you\
      \ get me.  All the other songs were way too clean and bombastic for this run-down\
      \ stink hole.  The sounds helped all the platforms feel old and rickety.  It\
      \ made some of the tunnels creak and I hope someone is listening intently for\
      \ their foe when one of these creaks catches them by suprise.  Finally, the\
      \ sounds needed to help give clues to the map's secrets.  They needed to consistently\
      \ point to a reasonable structure for the big effect and the other secrets in\
      \ the map.  I feel I was subtle, but successful.\n\nI was used to working with\
      \ particles like these in Unreal and I had fun making really cool effects that\
      \ ate fps like there was no tomorrow.  In the end, I managed to balance it pretty\
      \ well by economizing my [[Legacy:Emitter|Emitter]]s.  The JumpPads, for example,\
      \ needed enough particles to look like a quick puff of steam, but I needed it\
      \ to be able to trigger repeatedly and rapidly without running out of particles.\
      \ (Play Invasion and retreat via JumpPads and you'll see why when the monsters\
      \ jump after you in rapid succession.)\n\nThe [[Legacy:Trigger Systems|Trigger\
      \ Systems]] were a source of some frustration, when it came to my trigger door\
      \ lock.  The solution was as simple as a triggered door trigger that is placed\
      \ at the door itself. (''...simple, right?'')\n\n'''The big effect''' also needed\
      \ a custom [[Legacy:TriggerJumpPad|TriggerJumpPad]].  Tarquin and Foxpaw came\
      \ to my aid and the result is nice. (Thanks, folks!) :)\n\nThen, I worked on\
      \ carefully [[Legacy:Placing PlayerStart|Placing PlayerStart]]s.  Now, one thing\
      \ about Team Deathmatch always bothered me: Players spawn randomly around the\
      \ map.  This makes it difficult to group a squad and make use of your numbers.\
      \  You spend half your time just trying to get your Team together.  Now the\
      \ reason is logistical: Deathmatch maps are rarely balanced and set up for Teams,\
      \ so PlayerStarts aren't owned by any Team, as opposed to other TeamGames like\
      \ CTF, DOM and BR.  \"How can I get a Team Deathmatch game to spawn players\
      \ on the Team side?\", was one of my first questions here on UnrealWiki.\n\n\
      Foxpaw and Tarquin helped me to make my first custom actor: TeamSpawn.  It forces\
      \ players of Team Deathmatch games to spawn only at PlayerStarts that match\
      \ their [[Legacy:Team Number|Team Number]].  (That actually came about from\
      \ the GameTypeTrigger discussion; they do kinda go hand-in-hand, as Foxpaw points\
      \ out.)\n\n<uscript>\n//=============================================================================\n\
      // TeamSpawn.\n// Forces player spawning based on PlayerStart -> TeamNumber\
      \ if a Team Game.\n//=============================================================================\n\
      class TeamSpawn extends Actor\n    placeable;\n\nvar() bool bForceTeamSpawn\
      \ ;   // Will check PlayerStart -> TeamNumber \n\nsimulated function PreBeginPlay()\n\
      {\n  if ( bForceTeamSpawn )\n    if ( Level != None && Level.Game != None &&\
      \ Level.Game.IsA('TeamGame') )\n      TeamGame( Level.Game ).bSpawnInTeamArea\
      \ = true;\n  Super.PreBeginPlay();\n  Destroy();\n}\n</uscript>\n\nI left decorations\
      \ and extraneous things like the rattling fans until the end, and I didn't use\
      \ very many as I tried to keep framerate high and filesize low.\n\n====Bot Support====\n\
      \nThen came the meat of this project, the [[Legacy:Bot Support|Bot Support]];\
      \ starting with [[Legacy:Bot Pathing|Bot Pathing]].  I tested to see how far\
      \ apart [[Legacy:PathNode|PathNode]]s could be before the paths broke.  I used\
      \ that as a guide for the initial placement to keep the numbers down.  As I\
      \ went on, I would replace PathNodes with other [[Legacy:NavigationPoint|NavigationPoint]]s.\n\
      \n[[Legacy:JumpSpot|JumpSpot]]s were originally placed to give bots safe places\
      \ to land from great heights, they ended up being great places to translocate\
      \ to as well.  Translocator JumpSpots took a while to work out and I'm still\
      \ only 90% happy with them.  Lower skill bots still have problems translocating\
      \ due to poor aim and a wide variety of angles to the JumpSpots. (Bots seem\
      \ to have no problem reaching it from above but miss a lot from below, for example)\
      \  ''UPDATE: [http://www.leveldesigner.com/index.php?action=doc&ID=172#14 This]\
      \ is the answer I was looking for! (under Tricky Translocatoins) Now I know.\
      \  Thanks to [http://blitzscorner.blogspot.com/ Blitz]!''\n\n[[Legacy:AssaultPath|AssaultPath]]s\
      \ came last, as I saw a suprising amount of positive combat behavior without\
      \ them. (to be elaborated in Problems and Solutions, ''\"Did that bot just psyche\
      \ me out?\"'')\n\nStarting from a central point (for good Squad grouping), I\
      \ use four paths to the opposing GameObjective: Straight ahead, to the Left,\
      \ death from Above and the Back way.  These all converge to a single node in\
      \ front of the opponent's base.  Playing around with AssaultPath -> Priority\
      \ and the order in which the PathTags list, I came up with something I'm very\
      \ happy with.\n\nMy last considerations were about creating more [[Legacy:Strategic\
      \ Bots|Strategic Bots]].  I wrestled with the idea of giving bots the ability\
      \ to get the Redeemer; one of the two secrets of the map, leading to '''the\
      \ big effect'''.  But, I wanted it to be a true secret. (Bots always give away\
      \ secrets, you know; just follow them around.)  Not only are bots notoriously\
      \ bad about using the Redeemer effectively, but I also had minor problems getting\
      \ the bots to work my complex trigger systems.  That tore it.  My official line\
      \ on the subject is this:\n\n'''''\"Most people don't know how Gorge smuggled\
      \ the Redeemer in that day.  And I'm not telling.\"'''''\n\n''(See Spoiler section\
      \ below for full disclosure.)''\n\n''UPDATE: Today I saw the bots actually get\
      \ the Redeemer on their own!  See ''\"Did That Bot Just Psyche Me Out?\"'' below.''\n\
      \n====Problems And Solutions====\n\nThe following is a list of difficulties\
      \ I ran into with various elements of this map.  Later, I found the solutions\
      \ to these problems and keep this as a record of my progress from Unreal Engine\
      \ n00b to the confident and capable UScript Programmer & Level Designer I am\
      \ today.\n\n* '''Don't Ever Put Namespaces In Your Map Filenames'''\n\nThe original\
      \ namespace in \"DM-Base Ick\" causes a Server to attempt to transfer a 8.8MB\
      \ file called, \"DM-Base\".  Obviously, namespaces in map names are evil and\
      \ wrong.  I understand they prevent Linux users as well.\n\n* '''Dynamic Lighting\
      \ in Online Play'''\n\nWell, I finally got to test this map online. (Thanks,\
      \ Sihunt!)  Immediately, I see the dynamic flashing blue lights in the catwalks\
      \ are initially on.  Of course, it's not supposed to do that; it doesn't do\
      \ it in offline play.  Not sure why that happens.  But that's not the weird\
      \ part.  The strange thing is, when I go to those lights in the catwalk, they\
      \ reset to their proper off state upon line of sight.  So, I'll see the flashing\
      \ lights until I round the corner and am in line of sight with the (hidden)\
      \ light actor.  After I've gone thru both catwalks and \"seen\" all the flashing\
      \ light actors, the map behaves as it should.  To me, that's the weird part.\
      \  Comments on past experiences with dynamic lighting, anyone?\n\n'''Off-Kilter:'''\
      \ I'm no expert, but basically dynamic lighting is, for all intents and purposes,\
      \ broken. It has been suggested in various forums to use Trigger Lights instead\
      \ and just start them in the on state. Those, from what I've read, work.\n\n\
      '''SuperApe:''' Yes, these are [[Legacy:TriggerLight|TriggerLight]]s initially\
      \ set to Off, not On. (They use dynamic lighting)  I've heard / read / experienced\
      \ the same things about dynamic lighting being essentially broken, and to use\
      \ projectors instead.  And I agree that for a lot of basic uses, dynamic lighting\
      \ just looks bad; that's why not *all* the lights go out during \"the big effect\"\
      .  However, the dynamic lights can produce good results on basic lighting effects\
      \ if used with discretion, as demonstrated by BaseIck's '''big effect'''.  I\
      \ think dynamic lighting has it's place.  What does everyone else think?\n\n\
      (BTW, the name \"big effect\" is a bit tongue-in-cheek, as turning on/off lights\
      \ really should be one of the most basic lighting features in a 3D engine as\
      \ sophisticated as this one is.  Yet, you rarely see lights shut off in maps.)\n\
      \n'''Uncommon:''' Objects with bHidden=true (like Lights) don't get replicated\
      \ in a network game, so that could be related to the problem. You might try\
      \ setting DrawType=DT_None instead. Of course that could make them hard to find\
      \ and select in the editor, so you'd have to remember their names ;) Another\
      \ approach might be to create a subclass of TriggerLight in the myLevel package,\
      \ with altered default properties.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Yes, the light actors\
      \ are invisible.  Here's the problem that I saw in Online play: The blue-ish\
      \ flashy TriggerLights set to go off during '''the big effect''' are dynamic\
      \ lights that should stay dormant until triggered.  I saw those lights acting\
      \ as though I had set them initially on (they aren't, and they don't act this\
      \ way offline) so I could see flashing blue lights coming from within the Catwalks.\
      \  Because these are dynamic lights, they shine straight through BSP-work. \
      \ But, when I walked up the Catwalk those lights would switch to their proper\
      \ Off state by themselves.  I realized they switched back only when I had a\
      \ line-of-sight to the hidden TriggerLight actor. (I know where those lights\
      \ are without the actors visible.)\n\nSo, my real questions about dynamic lights\
      \ in online play are mainly about other people's experiences using them.  Bugs,\
      \ pitfalls, work-arounds, etc.  I worked with them as best I could, trying to\
      \ duplicate the look of the normal lights by using multiple dynamic lights in\
      \ different positions and intensities.  If you look in the Catwalks on BaseIck,\
      \ you'll see the light/tones cast from those look no different than the ones\
      \ in the Lower Tunnels, yet the light doesn't (visibly) shine through the BSP-work.\
      \  Anyone else see problems like the ones described above?\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ Having a lot more experience with [[Legacy:Replication|Replication]] now,\
      \ I understand why my TriggerLights weren't automatically set to off on Client\
      \ machines.  One day, I'll make a custom TriggerLight that solves this little\
      \ bug.\n\n* '''Dead Men Tell Tales'''\n\nI worked for a time to give the bots\
      \ a way to the Redeemer.  As mentioned, I finally decided not to give them the\
      \ power to do so on their own.  This was decided in part due to the bots tenacious\
      \ nature.  Their ability to go from the most powerful powerup in the map to\
      \ the biggest gun to the supershield, no matter how hidden or secret it is.\
      \  Just follow bots around in an unfamiliar map and you'll pick up all the secrets\
      \ and fruitful routes in no time.  Bots give away secrets.\n\nBut there's another\
      \ problem that proves to be a bigger secret killer to BaseIck.  When a player\
      \ or bot is killed and Karma takes over, the Pawn's collision changes with respect\
      \ to movers.  You've probably seen it more than a few times: a bot you mowed\
      \ down flies back through one of the sticky doors in Flux2, or falls through\
      \ a lift it was just riding on.  It's annoying to see such a big bug in an otherwise\
      \ neato Engine.\n\nThis problem proves devastating to BaseIck.  The Redeemer\
      \ access is supposed to be secret.  Even to spectators who can normally fly\
      \ through doors and lifts, the Redeemer can remain a secret because it is tucked\
      \ out of the way.  But on several occasions during testing, a bot had me cornered\
      \ near the power plants and I responded in force, only to watch the lifeless\
      \ body fly through the access hatch, indicating to me and anyone else watching\
      \ (or dying) where the Redeemer is.  At times, the bodies even triggered the\
      \ emergency hatch release and opened the door for me.  Argh!\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ Update:  I don't know why I missed it, but Collision->bBlockKarma seems to\
      \ actually do this properly.  I was checking to see if UT2k4 did Ragdoll collision\
      \ with movers, noticed that AS-Convoy (the big bridge that swings around) does\
      \ collide and I noticed that attribute set. When I double-checked one of the\
      \ lifts in BaseIck in UT2k3, it worked there too. (!)  My only good guess as\
      \ to why the power plant door doesn't block Ragdolls is that the model is not\
      \ subdivided enough for proper collision; that Ragdolls slip thru the Mover's\
      \ mesh.  BSP->Mesh work bites me in the a$$ again.  Live and learn.\n\n* '''That's\
      \ too much occlusion!'''\n\nWhile working on [[Legacy:Map Optimization|Map Optimization]],\
      \ I had the opportunity to take each part of the map and optimize step-by-step\
      \ to see how much each helped framerate during testing.  This included taking\
      \ large BSP decoration and coverting it to the imbedded mesh work.  As expected,\
      \ conversion from even simple BSP objects to meshes significantly increased\
      \ the speed of the map (like 60%) while decreasing file size (like 30%).  However\
      \ one piece didn't look good at all after Ued's conversion to mesh: the large\
      \ circular platforms in the bases.  I decided to leave this piece as BSP.  To\
      \ help with the framerates, I tried creating an anti-portal, just like the ones\
      \ used in the Center Hall platforms.  It did occlude some of the BSP faces of\
      \ the spherical room, but to my suprise, it actually lowered the frame rates.\
      \  I removed the anti-portals and left the bases as BSP.  The rooms are simple\
      \ enough that they only slightly impact framerate as BSP.\n\n* '''If Jesus were\
      \ my developer...'''\n\n'''\"The big effect\"''' would just be the beginning.\
      \  With repeated abuse, the power plants would be unable to restart.  And without\
      \ power from those plants, the geothermal forces that drive the base go unchecked\
      \ and unregulated.  What results would be an overflow of the underground magma\
      \ chambers from the bases, through the main rooms and into the large pits. \
      \ Lava would rise, crawl and flow in the bases and main rooms until reaching\
      \ the level just below the lower tunnels.  Only the mounds would be sticking\
      \ up from the floor of the main room; cutting off access to the base for an\
      \ extended period of time; when the lava would receed and drain.  The entire\
      \ base would become a steamy oven.  Older pieces of the base could break off,\
      \ fall to the floor and crush.\n\n* '''\"Did that bot just psyche me out?\"\
      '''\n\nI saw the [[Legacy:Bot Mind|Bot Mind]] perform some interesting things.\
      \  While working on the PathNodes, I had forgotten to place nodes that would\
      \ help bots escape from a crawlspace under the small platform in the bases.\
      \  While [[Legacy:Testing Botplay|Testing Botplay]], I saw a bot get stuck there\
      \ and I made a note to fix that on the next pass.  I ignored that bot and continued\
      \ to test; I believe I was playing DoubleDomination.  An enemy bot came to that\
      \ base and cut me down.  As soon as the enemy bot touched the DomPoint, I saw\
      \ from my ''DeathCam'' the \"stuck\" bot jump out from the crawlspace and reduce\
      \ the enemy to ground meat, graceful as could be.  This interesting behavior\
      \ made me decide to keep the crawlspace clear of paths, until I saw bot behavior\
      \ that actually warranted fixing.  But I expected to see that behavior shortly.\n\
      \nSeveral test games later, playing Capture the Flag, I saw another bot who\
      \ was in the crawlspace under the platform.  I didn't actually see this bot\
      \ until I had boldly charged into the enemy base, gibbed all defenders, grabbed\
      \ the flag and was heading out the base.  At that moment, a little low on health\
      \ but feeling good with the flag, that bot sniped me in the back.  It was hidden\
      \ from sight, crouching under the platform.  And once again from my ''DeathCam'',\
      \ I saw the bot merrily crawl out, leap up and return the flag without a hitch.\n\
      \nI saw bots use the crawlspace a dozen or more times.  I saw suprising behavior\
      \ that just flat outweighed any problems with \"sticky\" bots.  That particular\
      \ pathing bug is now officially a feature.\n\nOther behavior I was happy to\
      \ see bots doing on their own included intelligent use of all sniper positions\
      \ and ducking to use cover provided by mounds and barriers.  I also expected\
      \ many more friendly fire deaths when squads are in the longer lower tunnels,\
      \ but these bots do pretty well.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' UPDATE: This beats all!\
      \  Today the very highly improbable happened: The bots got the Redeemer on their\
      \ own (and kicked butt)!\n\nI was just now playing Team Deathmatch (4-on-4)\
      \ in [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=2361 DM-BaseIck].\
      \ (I had just used our Blue Team's Redeemer half a minute earlier and took out\
      \ two)  I was running with two Teammate bots towards the Lower Tunnels when\
      \ I saw something I honestly haven't seen in a long time, the Redeemer model.\
      \  I guess I was a little stunned because it took me and my two bot Teammates\
      \ out. (bots aren't ususally any good with the Redeemer)\n\nI was nowhere '''near'''\
      \ the Red Team's Redeemer, I didn't retrieve it at all that game.  The probablility\
      \ of bots getting it on their own is very low because two key events have to\
      \ take place in rapid succession.  One, a bot has to \"hack\" the door lock\
      \ (open it); which can probably only happen by being knocked into the Trigger\
      \ with a weapons blast.  Two, a (different) bot has to open the door, again\
      \ probably by being knocked into it. (Door actor is set to Block when closed,\
      \ so I know they aren't \"trying\" to get it.)\n\nNow, I even though I kept\
      \ a '''possible''' path for bots to see the Redeemer (with help), I thought\
      \ I had disabled their ability to get to it.  But, I suppose with as much playtesting\
      \ and just playing, the odds caught up with me.\n\n====Final Notes====\n\nMan,\
      \ I love UnrealWiki.  I couldn't have finished this map without it.  I hope\
      \ I can contribute as much as I've taken from it, but I kinda doubt anyone could\
      \ do so.  Gushing aside, thanks to anyone to helped, whether you knew it or\
      \ not. ;)\n\n====Spoilers / Cheats====\n\nThe following section spoils the two\
      \ secrets of BaseIck:\n\n1) The smuggled Redeemer can be found inside each power\
      \ plant.  Sounds made by the plants suggest something is wrong; turns out they\
      \ are running at half power.  The right side chamber is not running, due to\
      \ the Redeemer spawn device stuck inside.  (The Tournament roadies have almost\
      \ a third of the base powered from their own generators.)  By \"swiping\" the\
      \ power plant's center control panel, or running into it at a 45&deg; angle\
      \ left to right, you should be able to hack into the otherwise inaccessible\
      \ power plant controls and release the door lock to the right side chamber for\
      \ a few seconds.  Open that door and retrieve the Redeemer.  (If caught inside\
      \ the chamber, an emergency release can be reached by double jumping.)\n\nThe\
      \ control panel button is a mover with a very small collision radius; so small\
      \ that the recessed control panel almost makes it inaccessible.  I wanted a\
      \ button you really had to work on to trigger, so that players are standing\
      \ in a vulnerable spot (with their backs to the action) for a while in order\
      \ to get to the Redeemer. (risk vs reward)  It also allows causal collision\
      \ with the panel without unlocking the door.  ''Tip: If \"swiping\" the panel\
      \ doesn't work, a Dodge move into the panel should.''\n\n2) The power plants\
      \ are still unstable from previous Redeemer explosions; this old base was never\
      \ designed for such high power weaponry.  Power can be knocked out to nearly\
      \ half the base with a Redeemer hit to a power plant's control panel.  This\
      \ will not only shut off lights in the catwalks and the main globe lights in\
      \ the big rooms, but the jump pads are also disabled until the Tournament roadies\
      \ can bring the working half of the power plant back online. (This is '''\"\
      the big effect\"'''.)\n\nThe disabled jump pads change the game flow in all\
      \ BaseIck maps.  Without a translocator, the Keg o' Health is inaccessible,\
      \ as are quick routes to the Center Hall and the ammo cache near the power plant.\
      \  Even a Redeemer inside the disabled plant is inaccessible until power is\
      \ restored.  The team with the disabled power plant is temporarily crippled.</div></div>\n\
      \n----\n\n===MudSling===\n\nThis map marks the next step in my Unreal mapping\
      \ evolution.  I started with the strong gameplay foundation that I had honed\
      \ with the BaseIck maps and built upon that to deal with more aesthetic issues\
      \ including better lighting, much more decoration, more detailed effects, etc.\n\
      \nONS-MudSling was an UnrealPlayground ONS Mapping Contest entry.\n\n'''''NOTE:'''''\
      \ It is highly recommended that you download MudSling][ instead.  Although containing\
      \ essentially the same features, Mudsling][ updated and upgraded just about\
      \ every aspect of the map. (See next section)\n\n====Design Post Mortem====\n\
      \nI spent about eight days on this map.  It started with a grey scale painting\
      \ of the heightmap in photoshop.  When I brought it into a substracted space,\
      \ I adjusted the Terrain scale until the steep slopes felt right.  I spent some\
      \ time on the terrain, most of the time was spent on rebuilding the terrain\
      \ for the bunkers as smaller terrain maps.  Those terrains were made in Ued\
      \ and are G16 maps.  The decorative grassy clumps are a bit greener than I wanted,\
      \ but then again, they do look like a fresh spout of grass.\n\nThe decoration\
      \ was fun, particularly in the bunkers.  Some new stock meshes available in\
      \ UT2004 and I found myself hunting through nearly all of them.  Of course,\
      \ they gave me ideas for many of the gimmicks and gadgets.\n\nI have three big\
      \ gadgets in this map, the burning trees, the exploding bunkers and the laptop\
      \ computers.  They run on ScriptedTriggers using TriggerLights, Particle Emiters\
      \ and Material Switches.\n\nExcept for a few choice pieces of Art (including\
      \ the required UP ONS Mapping Contest Logo), all of the textures, static meshes,\
      \ sounds and music are all stock items that came with UT2004.  That includes\
      \ the building in the center, <tt>AW-Nature.garfunkel</tt>.\n\nAs I said, I\
      \ spent about eight days on this map.  I think my wife wishes I'd spent none.\
      \ ;)\n\n====Cheats and Spoilers====\n\nThere's just a few hidden things to this\
      \ map.\n; Forest Fires : You can easily start small forest fires.  All single\
      \ tall trees are dry enough to catch fire and burn.  Look out, fire hurts!\n\
      ; Command Bunkers : Each team has dug a command bunker loaded with health, armor\
      \ and ammo.  There's also a laptop computer set up in each bunker.\n; Latop\

      \ Lord_Simeon] with an Australian-themed map called, [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25273\
      \ AS-Outback] (which was later updated and released with the [http://www.unrealtournament.com/news/view5808.html?id=2996\
      \ Epic Mega Pack]), by modeling, skinning, rigging, animating and coding an\
      \ NPC character.  I hadn't seen many NPCs in UT200x, except the [[Legacy:TankVictim|TankVictim]]\
      \ and I've always been interested in artificial intelligence, so this was a\
      \ very interesting project all around.  Later, I created a mutator that populates\
      \ any map with ROOs, and offers minigames that are really more like whole new\
      \ gametypes. (RooHunt and Australian ROOlette)\n\n====Stand Alone ROO NPCs====\n\
      \n (Actor) [UT2004]\n   +- (Pawn)\n      +- '''Roo'''\n\nROOs are Kangaroo Non-Player\
      \ Characters (NPCs).  DM-RoosOnline is a simple one-room map that acts simply\
      \ as a pen to hold some sample ROOs.  You can simply select them from that map,\
      \ cut and paste them into your own map.  Download it [http://www.unrealplayground.com/forums/downloads.php?do=file&id=4868\
      \ here].  Comment on it [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24573\
      \ here].\n\n====The ROOtator====\n\nThis mutator adds kangaroo NPCs (ROOs) to\
      \ any map, any gametype, and offers many gameplay options like the RooHunt and\
      \ Australian RooLette minigames.  Find the final version of the ROOtator [http://unrealtournament2004.filefront.com/file/ROOtator;48668#Download\
      \ here]. (FileFront) ( mirror avaiable from  [http://files.vgpro.com/file/4352\
      \ VGPro] )  A thread on UnrealPlayground details the mutator [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=36679\
      \ here].\n\n====Behavior====\n\nROOs graze a lot.  They are startled easily.\
      \  When they're startled, they'll hop around until they get tired.  Then, they\
      \ stop and graze.  If they get stuck while hopping or if they hop into water,\
      \ they try to turn back to where they started.  You can startle ROOs by Bumping,\
      \ Triggering, Touching, or Damaging them.  If a ROO is killed, it calls out\
      \ to startle nearby ROOs.\n\n====Properties====\n; RooRate : The overall speed\
      \ (movement and animation) of the ROO.  1 = 100%, recommended 0.7-1.2.\n; RooRest\
      \ : Percentage chance the ROO will rest at each hop.  1 = 100%, recommended\
      \ 0.0-0.3.  0 = Never rest.\n; RooTimer : How many seconds after the ROO is\
      \ startled before it is removed from play.  0 = Never remove.\n\n====Tips====\n\
      * ROO size is modified by Display -> DrawScale, however to keep animation looking\
      \ good and to keep feet from \"sliding\", use a higher RooRate for smaller ROOs,\
      \ lower RooRate for larger ones.  (Example: A Joey ROO might have a DrawScale\
      \ of 0.67 and a RooRate of 1.15)\n* Minimum recommended RooRate is 0.67, Minimum\
      \ reccommended DrawSize is 0.5. \n* Groups of ROOs will look synched unless\
      \ their RooRates are different.  RooRates of slightly different values (like\
      \ < 0.01) will appear synched at first but will slowly run out of phase, but\
      \ similarly timed as if the timing were simply offset.\n* When placing groups\
      \ of ROOs, be aware of their relationship to your botpath network.  Bots will\
      \ not go after ROOs, but if they're placed on a path, it might be a wasted Roo\
      \ that is triggered and dissappears before any player sees it.\n* Groups of\
      \ ROOs will get startled when one dies (either by weapons fire or vehicular\
      \ slaughter, etc.).  You can get a scattering effect by placing them facing\
      \ away from the center, or a \"bumbling\" fire drill effect, by having them\
      \ face the center. \n* (Fast) ROOs set up to run <u>alongside</u> (paralell\
      \ with) the roads, can add some interest on the way to the next objective. \n\
      \n====RooBallet====\n\nLike setting up dominos to fall, placing ROOs can lead\
      \ to similar patterns of choreographed movement, or \"RooBallet\".  Although\
      \ their code makes them turn a bit each hop, their RooRest can be set near or\
      \ at 0 to help ensure that short distance target ROOs can be reached reliably.\n\
      \nAn example of a simple RooBallet pattern is a triangle placement, where each\
      \ ROO faces the next at around 512 UU away.  By placing a triggering ROO about\
      \ 1024 away from such a formation, and setting its RooRest to .01, once the\
      \ triggering ROO was startled it would definately run into one of the three\
      \ in the formation, each of those would trigger the next.  Each ROO can be a\
      \ trigger for another single or group of ROOs.\n\nBy setting the RooTimer and\
      \ RooRest to 0, you've created a ROO (CatalystRoo) that once startled will hop\
      \ around the map, startling any ROO it bumps into, until it is killed or otherwise\
      \ dies (via lava, pain volume, etc.)  Chaos Theory rules with a CatalystRoo.\
      \  Get creative.\n\n====Installation====\n\nFor use in your own custom map follow\
      \ these steps:\n# Remove any previous ROOs from your map, save, exit and re-launch\
      \ Ued.\n# Open DM-RoosOnline.ut2\n# Copy single or groups of ROOs to the clipboard.\n\
      # Open your custom map.\n# Somewhere in your map, Right click and go to Edit\
      \ -> Paste -> Here.\n# Save your map.\n# Credit me by saying, \"Thanks to SuperApe\
      \ for the ROOs!\", in your ReadMe file.\n\n----\n\n===VCTF-TerraForma===\n\n\
      Representing the next step, this map combines strong gameplay and aesthetic\
      \ details with custom elements meant to alter the basic gameplay, breathing\
      \ new life into the standard flow of the game.\n\n====Features====\n* A change\
      \ in the normal VCTF gameplay structure, by adding a \"gate\" that teams can\
      \ use to close and block opponents from reaching the flag.  The gate is open\
      \ at map start, must be activated by the team, will then become the primary\
      \ goal of the opponent (and bots), and can be destroyed, returning the gameplay\
      \ to normal.\n* An additional vehicle, Unmanned Aeral Vehicle (UAV) that can\
      \ be launched from a base and used to provide cover fire while the pilot remains\
      \ at base. (with bot support)  For early beta tests, a HumanSpaceFighter was\
      \ used, but the UAV vehicle is modeled, rigged, animated and imported.\n* Fortified\
      \ bases, gates and outposts with auto turrets that are activated by team members\
      \ to defend against the enemy.\n* \"Team Doors\", doors that open for one team,\
      \ not the other unless they carry a KeyCard inventory item, which can be stolen\
      \ from a dead opponent player.  This allows covert sabotage of outposts, gates,\
      \ bases, etc.  It was also designed to allow access to enemy team vehicles.\n\
      * Plenty of custom meshes, textures, actors, etc.\n\nThis map is still in beta\
      \ form.  It was being developed and tested on UnrealPlayground, but I've set\
      \ this aside for the moment.  You can view the beta map thread on UnrealPlayground\
      \ [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=26031 here] to see screenshots\
      \ made during development.  More later.\n\n----\n\n===Flashlight Mutator===\n\
      \nThis short project represents another venture into mutli-actor modding.  I\
      \ started with the idea of wanting to learn more about Projectors, and ended\
      \ up developing a system for implementing fairly realistic-looking flashlights\
      \ in a multiplayer map, including sophisticated bot support.\n\nThe result of\
      \ the project was a simple map, aptly named SimpleMap, where I encorporate the\
      \ actors I had to develop to carry the effect of realistic flashlights.  You\
      \ can download this SimpleMap and join the discussion on the [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38185\
      \ Flashlight Mutator] on UnrealPlayground forums.\n\nThe set of actors used\
      \ to pull this effect off varies from the Projector itself to the Display Message\
      \ needed to indicate to players how to turn the Flashlight on and off.  Here's\
      \ the component list:\n Actor\n   +- (Brush)\n   |  +- (Volume)\n   |     +-\
      \ '''DarkVolume'''\n   +- (Info)\n   |  +- (LocalMessage)\n   |  |  +- (BulldogMessage)\n\
      \   |  |     +- '''MessageFlashlight'''\n   |  +- (Mutator)\n   |  |  +- '''MutFlashlight'''\n\
      \   |  +- (ReplicationInfo)\n   |     +- '''FlashlightReplicationInfo'''\n \
      \  +- (Light)\n   |  +- (TriggerLight)\n   |     +- '''CoronaFlashlight'''\n\
      \   +- (Projector)\n   |  +- (DynamicProjector)\n   |      +- '''Flashlight'''\n\
      \   +- (Triggers)\n      +- '''ButtonFlashlight'''\n\nThe ButtonFlashlight is\
      \ a simple trigger that follows the player and enables them to hit Use to toggle\
      \ the flashlight.  MessageFlashlight is a simple message telling the player\
      \ to \"Hit Use to Toggle the Flashlight\".  FlashlightReplicationInfo keeps\
      \ things running online.  CoronaFlashlight provides a nice directional glare\
      \ when players with flashlight face the viewport.  Flashlight is the actual\
      \ projector which travels with the player pawn and works with DarkVolume to\
      \ help AIControllers determine when to toggle the flashlight on or off.  MutFlashlight\
      \ is the mutator that applies the Flashlight, ButtonFlashlight and CoronaFlashlight\
      \ to each player and cleans up flashlights when not needed.\n\nWith this system,\
      \ maps are specifically designed with an area to be dark and a DarkVolume is\
      \ used to indicate that area to Bots.  So, this is not an all-purpose stand-alone\
      \ mutator.  The map must be designed with flashlights in mind.  That's why I\
      \ embed each of these components in the virtual myLevel package in SimpleMap.\
      \  Because the flashlights are toggled via the Use key, this is not a good system\
      \ to implement in vehicle maps or vehicle gametypes.\n\n----\n\n===Old Skool\
      \ Monsta Toolz===\n\nThis is a project meant to help mappers implement complex\
      \ Unreal-style monster A.I. in any gametype.  It comprises a toolset of mapping\
      \ tools and a new set of ScriptedMonsters that mimic the old [[Legacy:ScriptedPawn|ScriptedPawn]]\
      \ AI from UT99.  It also contains a new story-driven gametype Old Skool Monsta\
      \ Adventure (OSM).  This project is in development at UnrealPlayground and has\
      \ been publicly available since July 2006.  OSM maps by some of my favorite\

      \ an example map I made to demonstrate how the new OSM Adventure gametype can\
      \ be implemented.  OSM mappers are encouraged to reverse-engineer it for reference.\
      \  This is a single player map that features a story that leads the players\
      \ to enter an ancient tomb.  Once inside, three different routes are available\
      \ to players, each one emphasizing a different important element of OSM Adventure:\
      \ Puzzle, Trap or Monster.  This is meant to add some replay value for players\
      \ as well as demonstrate to mappers various ways these three elements can be\
      \ combined for interest.  At the end of each route, the player will find themselves\
      \ at the final battle area, where the story wraps up and the biggest challenge\
      \ is presented.  Finally a short ending cutscene completes the adventure.\n\n\
      This is by far the most complete and ''prettiest'' map I've made in any game\
      \ engine.  I'm reasonably proud of the visuals as well as the technical elements,\
      \ as I normally concentrate more on the gameplay and technical aspects of my\
      \ maps.  It may not be the ultimate map ever, but I had fun developing it concurrently\

      \ me use the tool for my mod. id like to talk to you more about what is required\
      \ in my game and how much your tool could help me. one of my question is how\
      \ good is your NPC/monster AI compare to what is provided with UT2004. i know\
      \ youve worked realy hard to get this tool even starting back in the 80's if\
      \ im correct. so i understand the pride in your work if you let me use it or\
      \ not. i dont think i will ever release my mod publically though so i hope that\
      \ for some reason allow you to let me to use it.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' I understand.\

      \ discussions on use and distribution, you can find me on [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/\

      \ other custom script that might do the job? Oh, and that's my spam-address,\
      \ so that's ok.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' What does this keycard entail?  If you're\
      \ wanting to let only certain teams into an area, I'm sure that can be done\
      \ easilly with a scripted trigger.  If you wanted something more along the lines\
      \ of a player having to pick up a 'keycard' to be able to open certain doors,\
      \ you can have one class that is that 'keycard' and when the player touches\
      \ it, have it add the players pawn onto to a list that would reside in a custom\
      \ mover or whatever.  Then when the player would go to open said mover, the\
      \ mover would first check to see if that particular player was on the 'list'\
      \ of those with a keycard and if they are, it opens.  It sounds less messier\
      \ than dealing with an inventory class.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Any lengthy discussion\
      \ might be better served elsewhere, so I'll try to be brief.  PiX, I don't know\
      \ of any other system that does this, but you can try searching for Team-based\
      \ tools for CTF/VCTF.  Many ways of using stock methods for blocking or limiting\
      \ by team can be \"clunky\" and/or compromised in unintentional ways; making\
      \ it messy to map with.  In response to Myth, I've explored many methods of\
      \ team blocking using stock actors and trigger systems.  Your second description\
      \ of what the TeamDoors/Keycard system is meant to be in VCTF-TerraForma is\
      \ close, but if you review the description I give above and/or follow the link\
      \ there to the UnrealPlayground forum thread on this map, I give at least one\
      \ important feature, \"you can pick one up from a dead opponent.\"  This is\
      \ crucial to the gameplay mechanic, as it is a designed way to infiltrate the\
      \ opponent's gatehouse, outpost, etc.  But, futher details are classified. \
      \  Rest assurred since I put this map down, I've had a lot more experience in\
      \ UScript development and should be able to put this together without much trouble.\
