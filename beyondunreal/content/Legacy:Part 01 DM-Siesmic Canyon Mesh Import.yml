      \ I make a new <i>Additive</i> level, I save it, and give it a name such as\
      \ <b>DM-Test</b>, I open the generic browser, and click import under the file\
      \ menu, and select both textures (all 4 in my case because I have normal maps),\
      \ I also take the time and care not to click OK to all, I have no idea why I\
      \ do this, it just seems logical to me, but I ensure that the <i>CompressionSettings</i>\
      \ drop down is set to TC_Default for regular textures, and <i>TC_NormalMap</i>\
      \ for normal maps and I do the same for <i>LODGroup</i>. I also import the mesh.</p>\n\
      <p>The name you give to the Package is important, when making a map, wether\
      \ it be a DeathMatch or other type, you should always have your content stored\
      \ in a package which is the same name.</p>\n<p>In these tutorials however, I\
      \ am breaking from this standard, for one main reason, mainly I have not started\
      \ my level yet, and I want to keep my content in one main file, I am naming\
      \ my package <i>ASphinx-Content</i>, keep in mind, that when I do start making\
      \ my level though, I intend to <b>Duplicate</b> the content that I use to a\
      \ file that matches the levels name. Unless you intend making a content pack,\
      \ <b>**do not**</b> distribute your content file <i>e.g.(ASphinx-Content)</i>\
      \ with your map, if your map don't work without this content file, then you\
      \ have done something wrong when assigning a material, texture, or something\
      \ else to your level, also <i>be aware</i> this method also increases overhead,\
      \ if you want to speed and refine the process, import/create your content directly\
      \ into a file of the same name as your map <i>(eg. If DM-Siesmic is the name\
      \ of the map, then DM-Siesmic should also be the name of your content package)</i>.</p>\n\
      <p>As for the group, it is like a sub-directory, or a folder to contain various\
      \ things you import, much like your computers filesystem, it is mainly used\
      \ for catagorizing the things you import to speed up searching for things, you\
      \ could just have textures and meshes as your groups, or you could use DiffuseTextures,\
      \ NormalMaps, and Meshes as your groups, it really doesn't matter, and is left\
      \ to personal preference.</p>\n<p>I make a new material called SteamVent_Mat,\
      \ and open the material editor, see <b>Tile #04</b> to see what I have done\
      \ in the Material Editor.</p>\n<p>I then go to the mesh and open up its properties,\
      \ the first thing I then do is go back to the generic browser, and select the\
      \ material we just made, and apply it to the mesh, this is done by unfolding\
      \ the properties as shown in <b>Tile #05</b>.</p>\n<p>With the material applied,\
      \ a few things still need to be done, the next thing on the list is to make\
      \ a quick collision map, you can find the Collision -&gt; Auto Convex Collision,\
      \ and use the settings shown on <b>Tile #06</b>, there are better ways to do\
      \ this, which I will probably cover later when we actually import this into\
      \ more than just a test file.</p>\n<p>Last thing to do is get a good angle and\
      \ take a shot for the Generic Browser, this can found under Tool -&gt; Save\
      \ Thumbnail Angle.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Navigation\">Navigation</span><span\

      \ #04: A few big things happen here, take a look at the vertexcolor component,\
      \ it is what determines which pattern will be applied from the vertex painting\
      \ we done, nothing more really needs to be done except to LERP the two materials\
      \ together using this pattern, LERP stands for Linear Interpolate, it is a straight\
      \ ramp from 0.0 to 1.0, as opposed to cubic or sinisoid interpolate, which measure\
      \ the distance between the two numbers in such a way that the distance between\
      \ the fractions are not equal, this basically means that there should be no\
      \ distortion ''(note cubic and sinsoid interpolate don't exist in the material\
      \ editor, for the point that they are next to useless in the world of textures)''.\
      \ You will notice I have 3 Lerps, they all use the same VertexColor map, but\
      \ have different inputs and connect to different functions in the material,\
      \ the textures are Lerp'd to Diffuse, the normal maps are Lerp'd to Normal,\
      \ and then I have two constants that are Lerp'd to the Specular, Specular determines\
      \ the amount of light that bounces back at you, a value of 0.05 is used for\
      \ the soil, as it drinks the light in and gives little back, the effect gives\
      \ it a very dull sheen, the mud gets a value of 0.15, giving it a much stronger\
      \ effects, making it look more like it is wet, ''without some sort of specular\
      \ lighting, the normal maps are not readily apparent'']]\n\n[[Image:Legacy_DMSiesmic_3DSMax_SteamVent_10.jpeg|center|Tile\
