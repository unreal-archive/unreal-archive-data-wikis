      <dd>UnrealEd is included in the PC version of Unreal Tournament and other Unreal\

      \ you'll need either a seperate PC or an emulator and a PC version of the game&#160;:(.\
      \ On a PC, look for the folder that your game is installed in: usually <tt>C:\\\
      UnrealTournament</tt>. Look for a folder called <tt>System</tt> inside this.\
      \ In there, you should find an application called <b>UnrealEd</b>. See <a href=\"\

      \ problem with one of the previous patches. UnrealEd was compiled on a PC running\
      \ a certain version of the necessary Runtime DLLs. The version running on that\
      \ PC was one of the latest ones, so anyone installing the patch and wanting\
      \ to run UnrealEd would need at least those version of the runtime DLLs. This\
      \ was fixed in a later patch by compiling the editor on a PC running a lowest\
      \ version possible.</p>\n<p>In some cases it has been known that, even with\
      \ the latest patch, the <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_Browser\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\
      \ Browser\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Actor browser</a> still doesn't show any actors.\
      \ I've been told this can be solved by installing Internet Explorer 5.5 or Update\
      \ your Windows. This will install a correct version of the Common Controls DLL\
      \ (<tt>Windows\\System\\Comctl32.dll</tt>).</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>UnrealEd\
      \ seems to load a map but there's nothing there&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This happens\
      \ when UnrealEd can't find a reference such as a texture or sound package. Either\
      \ you're missing that package or the file paths are incorrect. Check the <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Log_File\" title=\"Legacy:Log File\">log file</a>: the log\
      \ will say 'Failed to load map' or something similar. It will give you the packages\
      \ it cannot find directly below. This error can happen if you load a map from\

      <dd>Selecting multiple actors is easy. There are several ways to accomplish\

      \ key and click on each actor you want to select. An actor can be a brush, lightsource,\
      \ weapon, ... Another way is using <tt>Ctrl+Alt</tt>. Press and hold down the\
      \ <tt>Ctrl</tt> key and the <tt>Alt</tt> key and drag a box around the actors\
      \ you want to select. And yet another way is to simply right-click each actor.\
      \ So right-click the first actor (<a href=\"/Legacy:Right-Click_Menu\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Right-Click Menu\">a menu</a> will appear, but don't bother with that),\
      \ then right-click the second and so on.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Can I use mathematical\

      \ like \"=64*2\" into a field. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Brushbuilders\" title=\"\

      \ version of the necessary Runtime DLLs. The version running on that PC was\
      \ one of the latest ones, so anyone installing the patch and wanting to run\
      \ UnrealEd would need at least those version of the runtime DLLs. This was fixed\
      \ in a later patch by compiling the editor on a PC running a lowest version\
      \ possible.\n\nIn some cases it has been known that, even with the latest patch,\
      \ the [[Legacy:Actor Browser|Actor browser]] still doesn't show any actors.\
      \ I've been told this can be solved by installing Internet Explorer 5.5 or Update\
      \ your Windows. This will install a correct version of the Common Controls DLL\
      \ (<tt>Windows\\System\\Comctl32.dll</tt>).\n\n\n\n; UnrealEd seems to load\
      \ a map but there's nothing there : This happens when UnrealEd  can't find a\
      \ reference such as a texture or sound package. Either you're missing that package\
      \ or the file paths are incorrect. Check the [[Legacy:Log File|log file]]: the\
      \ log will say 'Failed to load map' or something similar. It will give you the\
      \ packages it cannot find directly below. This error can happen if you load\
      \ a map from CD.\n\n===Minor Niggles ===\n\n;How do you scale multiple objects\
      \ so they are still proportionate (same ratio height width length) : Export\
      \ the brushes and actors and use [[Legacy:MapScale|MapScale]].\n\n;I've made\
      \ a mover but It's completely non-solid, players can pass through! What's the\
      \ problem? : Probably you had manually rescaled or rotated the [[Legacy:Red\
      \ Builder Brush|red builder brush]] before you use it to intersect the [[Legacy:Mover|mover]]\
      \ shape. Reset all transformations on the RBB then change its size with numeric\
      \ values until it is big enough to enclose all the shape. See [[Legacy:Create\
      \ A Mover|Create a mover]] for more.\n\n; How do I add a preview screenshot\
      \ to my level? : See [[Legacy:Level Screenshot|Level Screenshot]].\n\n; What's\
      \ this thing called autosave? : See [[Legacy:UnrealEd Advanced Options|UnrealEd\
      \ Advanced Options]].\n\n; How do I change the pivot point of a brush? : See\
      \ [[Legacy:Pivot|Pivot]].\n\n; I'm trying to rotate brushes, but it makes them\
      \ change shape instead of rotating. What's up? : See [[Legacy:Transform Permanently|Transform\
      \ Permanently]].\n\n; How can I select brushes quicker? : When you hold down\
      \ the <tt>Shift</tt> key and click on a surface, UnrealEd will select the brush\
      \ to which that surface belongs to. This is very useful when you want to know\
      \ to which brush a certain surface belongs to.\n\n; How do I select multiple\
      \ actors? : Selecting multiple actors is easy. There are several ways to accomplish\
      \ this. One is using the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key. Press and hold down the <tt>Ctrl</tt>\
      \ key and click on each actor you want to select. An actor can be a brush, lightsource,\
      \ weapon, ... Another way is using <tt>Ctrl+Alt</tt>. Press and hold down the\
      \ <tt>Ctrl</tt> key and the <tt>Alt</tt> key and drag a box around the actors\
      \ you want to select. And yet another way is to simply right-click each actor.\
      \ So right-click the first actor ([[Legacy:Right-Click Menu|a menu]] will appear,\
      \ but don't bother with that), then right-click the second and so on.\n\n; Can\
      \ I use mathematical expressions in builder properties? : Yes you can. Type\
      \ something like \"=64*2\" into a field. See [[Legacy:Brushbuilders|brushbuilders]]\
      \ for more.\n\n; How does the vertex editing mode work? : See [[Legacy:Vertex\
      \ Editing|Vertex Editing]].\n\n; Isn't there an easier way to pick and apply\
      \ textures (quick texturing)? : Yes there is. See '''Surface Painting''' on\
      \ the [[Legacy:Selecting Surfaces|Selecting Surfaces]] page.\n\n; How can I\
      \ scale lights? : To scale lights first select the lights you want to scale.\
      \ Then do [[Legacy:UnrealEd Main Menu|UnrealEd Main Menu]] -> Tools -> Scale\
      \ Lights, check ''Percentage'' and type in a value to your liking.\n\n; How\
      \ do I make solid glass, using sheets or regular brushes? : See [[Legacy:Making\
      \ Windows (UT)|Making Windows (UT)]].\n\n; I can't import textures. What's wrong?\
      \ : See the troubleshooting list on [[Legacy:Texture Import And Export|Texture\
      \ Import and Export]].\n\n; My reachspecs keep increasing at each rebuild. Can\
      \ I decrease it again? : \n\n\nReachspecs keep increasing at each rebuild even\
      \ when you didn't change the pathnode network. To clean things up you do the\
      \ following:\n\n# Select a Pathnode. \n# Right-Click it and click ''Select All\
      \ Pathnodes''. \n#Right-Click again and goto ''Order'' and click ''Last''. \n\
      # [[Legacy:Build|Rebuild]]. \n\nNow the reachspecs should be reset.\n\n\n\n\
