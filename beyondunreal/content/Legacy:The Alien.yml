      \ Wiki = cool</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>The Alien</i>: Ooooh!\
      \ I was wondering where this page actually was. Seems like I've found it! =)\
      \ It's on the project contributers page (don't laugh, it was hard enough finding\
      \ it, OK? LOL!&#160;:D)</dd>\n<dd>Anyways, I'm now working on a skin for UnrealWiki.\
      \ Should be done soon enough. After that, I'm gonna add something to the <i>music</i>\
      \ section, since I know the most about that (after reading through tons of tutes\
      \ on it). Hmm....I don't notice any difference between the <i>Emphasize</i>,\
      \ <b>strongly</b> and '<i><b>very strongly'</b></i>...wassup?</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd><i>Tarquin</i>: that's just me running out of ideas for the CSS...\
      \ are you working on a header file, a stylesheet or both? I'm in the process\
      \ of updating the script, it's shortly going to put the entire Wiki content\
      \ inside a DIV class=Wiki, which will make avoiding clashes between header and\
      \ body styles much easier, also means the body tag can have margins &amp; padding\
      \ set to 0 so the header is flush with the page, and then the wiki div chooses\
      \ its own margins. email me if you want the template.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>The\
      \ Alien</i>: The three ways to make a text bold, does work, but only for bigger\
      \ font sizes. For example, H1 can have a boldness range of 100-900. That's kinda\
      \ what I'm also using in the stylesheet. AFAIK, this effect doesn't become visible\
      \ with smaller font sizes. Dunno how it displays on other screens. You could\
      \ make the emphasize bold, the strongly bold+italic and the very strongly bold,\
      \ italic+underlined. You should ask for a little feedback from the others&#160;;-)<br\
      \ />\nFor now, I'm just working on the stylesheet itself. The header file needs\
      \ a bit more time to figure out on my end&#160;;-)<br />\nI just need to edit\
      \ the headings, table &amp; ul/ol tags. If it's just the class=Wiki that's gonna\
      \ change, I could just make every tag inherit this class or something (think\
      \ I got it the other way round...). Is this change gonna be temporary? If not,\
      \ then there's little point in adjusting the stylesheets.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dd><i>Tarquin</i>: Wiki body only uses H2 - H5 so in headers so far I've stuck\
      \ to H1 and H6 and declared things like #header A. So for ul, ol, table etc\
      \ it's fine to do anything globally. I'm wondering whether to try applying one\
      \ of the Wiki table syntax patches, there are a few available I think. They\
      \ allow tables to be made with the | character in Wiki. I've quickly put some\
      \ notes on <a href=\"/Legacy:Project_Skins\" title=\"Legacy:Project Skins\"\
      >Project Skins</a>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>The Alien</i>: The tables patch\
      \ seems pretty handy, especially for newbies at HTML. I don't really mind either\
      \ of the methods. With HTML tables, I can edit the colspan, rowspan, bordercolor\
      \ etc. Dunno about this Wiki syntax table...<br />\nSo what's the part in the\
      \ stylesheet saying:\n<pre>H2+H3, H2+H4, H3+H4  {</pre></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>margin-top:2px;}\
      \ &#160;?? Are those combitations of headings you can make? Oh and can you tell\
      \ me the locations of different forms on UnrealWiki, i.e. the save/preview/summary\
      \ form (when editing pages), the forms in <i>Preferences</i> the search form\
      \ (below each page) and so on... I was wondering whether there are more here.\
      \ I need to check them with the stylesheet I'm making.&#160;;-)</p>\n<dl>\n\
      <dd><i>Tarquin</i>: H2+H3 means an H3 that follows immediately after an H2.\
      \ I've used it in the blue style to add a bit of extra space between consecutive\
      \ headings, and in the textbook style to make the heading blocks flush with\
      \ each other. I'm not sure how many forms there are. I think you've covered\
      \ the ones most users see. There's a couple of admin forms: rename pages, ban\
      \ IP. I think that's it.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>The Alien</i>:OK, so far\
      \ so good. BTW, why are there two times <i>dl</i> and <i>dl dt</i> in the stylesheet?</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>Tarquin</i>: ooops...</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>The Alien</i>:\
      \ LOL, OK from what I see, I've completed the stylesheet. Check your email.&#160;;)</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>the G.o.a.T</i>: OK, when can see the results of this secret\
      \ gathering here??&#160;;) And Tarquin, what about that navigation bar on the\
      \ left, is it still coming?</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>Tarquin</i>: the nav bar\
      \ &amp; new styles are coming soon. I posted a screenie to BU Off-Topic recently,\
      \ do a search there if you want a preview. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in\
      \ IE, only Mozilla &amp; Opera so it won't be the default header&#160;:(</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>the G.o.a.T</i>: Ok this is new to me. You made sumtin that\
      \ works in those browsers but not IE?? I've always found that it mostly the\
      \ other way around, it works in IE but not those others. Weird&#160;:/</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>The Alien</i>: Does that huge javascript text go into the\
      \ heading? Couldn't you add a DHTML or XML nav bar? Dunno if it can be done...\
      \ It's a shame...the nav bar in the pic looks very nice =)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dd><i>Tarquin</i>: there's no javascript, it's all done with CSS. The bar floats\
      \ frame-like and IE6 doesn't support this... I'll play around &amp; try an inferior\
      \ version that moves with the content, maybe I can get that to work on all platforms.<br\
      \ />\nDon't mention XML, I'll be too tempted to convert the whole site over\
      \ to it...&#160;:-D</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>the G.o.a.T</i>: XML is good/cool\
      \ though&#160;:o</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>The Alien</i>: I didn't know there\
      \ was a way to add text with CSS. I always thought most of it was just lay-out&#160;:confused:</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>Wormbo</i>: There is a way, but IE doesn't support it.</dd>\n\
