      \ title=\"Legacy:Unreal Engine\">Unreal engine</a> 1 games are all in <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:UMX_File\" title=\"Legacy:UMX File\">UMX file</a> formats. Basically,\
      \ a umx file doesn't contain anything special except for the music track itself\
      \ which was imported into this umx (this is not entirely true). So which music\
      \ formats can be used to create umx files?</p>\n<p>Games that use the earlier\
      \ Unreal Engine builds (like Unreal, UT and Deus Ex) support <i>Direct music</i>\
      \ (MID, MIDI and RMI) and <a href=\"/Legacy:Music_Modules\" title=\"Legacy:Music\
      \ Modules\">Music Modules</a> - usually shortened to \"MOD\", but <i>not</i>\
      \ to be mistaken with a game mod! Modules can have different formats, like .s3m,\
      \ .xm, .it, .mod.</p>\n<p>Also, CD audio can be used as music in maps. However,\
      \ CDA files don't need to be imported into a umx. You can just assign a track\
      \ number to your map. This is rather pointless though, as the chances that someone\
      \ will have the same CD you do in their drive when they play the map is practically\
      \ null. In practice, you'll want to export the music from the CD and then import\
      \ it into the editor seperately.</p>\n<p><b>Hellkeeper:</b> .UMX are \"packages\"\
      \ of musics, usually containing 2 or 3 tracks (in Unreal 1, not in UT)&#160;:\
      \ if you set a SongSection) in the level propreties or a MusicEvent trigger,\
      \ you can switch between the differents section. In the original Unreal, this\
      \ was used to change the music while fighting or when special events took place.</p>\n\

      \ You would import the music into Your map but in this case, You convert it\
      \ into OGG, place into correct directory and give the file name (without suffix)\
      \ in the LevelProperties-&gt;Audio-&gt;Song. There are a few caveartes in this\
      \ though:</p>\n<p>- the OGG player does not obey the PATHS= settings in the\
      \ UT2003.ini file so if You have a separate directory for map developement,\
      \ You won't hear Your music - for some reason it has to be placed in the same\
      \ folder as the rest of the OGG files.</p>\n<p>- trying to play the OGG in the\
      \ editor will crash-boom-bang</p>\n<p>Now, to create the OGG files You need\
      \ an OGG capable converter. One that is freeware and works can be found <a rel=\"\
      nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.dbpoweramp.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n\
      <p>It is not recommended to rip music off of music CD's - instead You can create/use\
      \ MIDI and convert it to WAV using <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\"\
      \ href=\"http://www.modplug.com/index.php3\">ModPlug tracker</a>. The WAV is\
      \ then again easy to convert into OGG.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Note:</b> this is completely\
      \ unnecessary. If you want to use a piece of music on a CD, run it through WinAmp\
      \ and output it to OGG format. Done deal. MIDI is extremely unreliable, as the\
      \ sounds you hear on one computer can vary widely from the sounds you hear on\
      \ another, and converting to WAV is an unnecessary step.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>A more\
      \ widely used alternative is the Oggdrop utility. Download it <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.vorbis.com/download_win.psp\">here</a>.\
      \ Start it and just drag the wav file onto it and it will encode it for you.\
      \ Right click on it to alter options like bitrate, quality, mono/stereo etc.\
      \ I (Hawkeye) prefer OggdropXPD myself which is the exact same tool but with\
      \ more options. Highly recommended for it's speed, versatility and ease of use.</p>\n\

      \ everything into a quick and clean explanation of how to do things, and then\
      \ link to pages with some of this \"<i>extremely</i> in-depth info\"&#160;;-).</p>\n\
      <p><b>Wormbo:</b> This page definately needs some work.</p>\n<p><b>RDGDanClark:</b>\
      \ I'm not a total expert on music in Unreal Engine games, but I'll see what\
      \ I can do here.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> This page has a lot of repetition and\
      \ redundancy. I'll add the <a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Refactor_Me\" title=\"\
      Category:Legacy Refactor Me\">Category:Legacy Refactor Me</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Nuleo:</b>\
      \ The Ogg Vorbis format really sucks. Even though it has a higher compression\
      \ ratio, even at the highest quality, it sounds muffled, scratchy, and less\
      \ bright than mp3s or wavs and I have composed about 12 minutes of music so\
      \ far for a UT2003 Total Conversion. I think this is part of the reason why\
      \ the UT2003 soundtrack isn't very good.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> In theory, Ogg\
      \ Vorbis is a lossless compression format so it shouldn't sound any different.\
      \ It's possible that the decoder built in to UT2003 is not very good. In UT\
      \ at least, there was a major difference between the music in-game and the same\
      \ music files played using Winamp or Sonique, so maybe this is kind of the same\
      \ deal.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Well, are you refering to the add-on music\
      \ player in ut2k3 or some other thing&#160;?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> No, I mean\
      \ that UT did not produce a completely faithful playback of the actual MOD file\
      \ that was supposedly being played as music. This was not a flaw in the format,\
      \ simply a consequence of UT's playback mechanism. Similarly, the Ogg Vorbis\
      \ files may sounds bad in UT2003, but I highly, highly doubt that it is the\
      \ fault of the format. As far as I know, an Ogg Vorbis file decoded should be\
      \ completely identical to the source waveform.</p>\n<p><b>Nuleo:</b> Ogg files\
      \ are not completely identical to their source (.wav or other) files. And the\
      \ quality of the ogg files is still worse than the mp3s even when played in\
      \ Winamp. Probably cause the mp3 format has been around longer so better mp3\
      \ encoders are available.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> It all depends on the bitrate\
      \ used. At the same bitrate an OGG sounds better than an MP3. Try e.g. 64kb/s,\
      \ you'll definately notice the effect.</p>\n<p><b>Hawkeye:</b> Ogg Vorbis is\
      \ much better than mp3 at equal bitrate. This is true at both low (32-64) and\
      \ high (192-up) bitrates.</p>\n<p>Trust me on this. I ripped 500 Audio CD's\
      \ first in mp3 and changed to ogg because they sound much better than mp3 at\
      \ equal or slightly lower bitrates.</p>\n<p><b>Graphik:</b> I cleaned a little\
      \ before realizing the futility. This page needs a complete rewrite.</p>\n<p><b>Birelli:</b>\
      \ Ok, I moved the info on <a href=\"/Legacy:Music_Modules\" title=\"Legacy:Music\
      \ Modules\">Music Modules</a> to it's own page. This makes the page a lot easier\
      \ to read, and really all that info belongs on it's own page. I think next is\
      \ to re-write the \"assigning music to maps\" and move it towards the top of\
      \ the page. Maybe even it's own page, this is really the only info most people\
      \ care about.</p>\n<p><b>Birelli:</b> Alright, I think I've finally got things\
      \ in at least somewhat working order. Nowhere on this page was there a description\
      \ of how to import a music file into your map. The <a href=\"/Legacy:Importing_Music\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Importing Music\">Importing Music</a> page has what used to\
      \ be the \"Importing Music\" section of this page, but it doesn't seem to actually\
      \ instruct how to import music. Probably that page's content should be moved\
      \ to another page about the different formats available and replaced with a\
      \ nice tutorial about how to import a music file into the music browser.</p>\n\
      <p>Anyway, is everyone happy with this current structure? If so let's work inside\
      \ it to polish things up. It's not done yet, but it's at least understandable.\
      \ In particular the discussion of the OGG file format needs to be cleaned up\
      \ and probably moved up under the \"latest engine file formats\" or even onto\
      \ its own page about the OGG format.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time\

      \ in Unreal Engine Games]] ... or [[Legacy:Importing Music|Importing Music]]\n\
      \n}}\n\n----\n\nMusic can be one of the most important factors in your map.\
      \ Setting the right music can create an awesome atmosphere and improve [[Legacy:Gameplay|gameplay]].\
      \ This section covers almost everything that's related to adding music to your\
      \ map.  The official information regarding Unreal/UT music files is available\
      \ at http://unreal.epicgames.com/music.htm.\n\n==File Formats ==\n\nThe [[Legacy:Unreal\
      \ Engine|Unreal engine]] has used a number of different file formats over its\
      \ many incarnations. These fall into two groups:\n; track formats : a bit like\
      \ a MIDI file bundled with samples to play: these are a combination of short\
      \ sound clips and instructions on when to play them\n; audio formats : an exact\
      \ audio recording of the entire piece of music\n\n===Early Unreal Engine's Music\
      \ Formats ===\n\nThe music tracks in [[Legacy:Unreal Engine|Unreal engine]]\
      \ 1 games are all in [[Legacy:UMX File|UMX file]] formats. Basically, a umx\
      \ file doesn't contain anything special except for the music track itself which\
      \ was imported into this umx (this is not entirely true). So which music formats\
      \ can be used to create umx files?\n\nGames that use the earlier Unreal Engine\
      \ builds (like Unreal, UT and Deus Ex) support ''Direct music'' (MID, MIDI and\
      \ RMI) and [[Legacy:Music Modules|Music Modules]] - usually shortened to \"\
      MOD\", but ''not'' to be mistaken with a game mod! Modules can have different\
      \ formats, like .s3m, .xm, .it, .mod.\n\nAlso, CD audio can be used as music\
      \ in maps. However, CDA files don't need to be imported into a umx. You can\
      \ just assign a track number to your map. This is rather pointless though, as\
      \ the chances that someone will have the same CD you do in their drive when\
      \ they play the map is practically null. In practice, you'll want to export\
      \ the music from the CD and then import it into the editor seperately.\n\n'''Hellkeeper:'''\
      \ .UMX are \"packages\" of musics, usually containing 2 or 3 tracks (in Unreal\
      \ 1, not in UT) : if you set a SongSection) in the level propreties or a MusicEvent\
      \ trigger, you can switch between the differents section. In the original Unreal,\
      \ this was used to change the music while fighting or when special events took\
      \ place.\n\n===Latest Unreal Engine's Music Formats ===\n\nOGG is the new music\
      \ format used in UnrealEngine2. ''Ogg Vorbis'' format is an open source encoding\
      \ format and has a higher compression rate than MP3. This means that the same\
      \ quality of music will have a smaller .OGG file than the same quality .MP3\
      \ file. Put differently, if you have a .OGG file and a .MP3 file of the same\
      \ size, the .OGG file will have a higher quality.\n\nMore info about ogg vorbis\
      \ at: \n* [http://www.vorbis.com/ Vorbis.com] - Main site\n* [http://www.xiph.org/ogg/]\
      \ - Definition of \"Ogg projects\". Related page: [http://www.xiph.org/about.html]\n\
      * [http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/index.html] - More info\n* And there's an\
      \ ogg vorbis encoder/decoder available for [http://www.winamp.com./ Winamp Music\
      \ Player].\n\n==Adding Music to Maps ==\n\nThe procedure for [[Legacy:Assigning\
      \ Music To Maps|Assigning Music to Maps]] is the same regardless of what version\
      \ of the engine you are using. However, as noted above, different engines (and\
      \ even different licensed games using the same engine) have different formats\
      \ that they support, so the procedure for [[Legacy:Importing Music|Importing\
      \ Music]] and what file formats can be imported may vary.\n\n==OGG Vorbis Discussion\
      \ ==\n\nNormally You would import the music into Your map but in this case,\
      \ You convert it into OGG, place into correct directory and give the file name\
      \ (without suffix) in the LevelProperties->Audio->Song. There are a few caveartes\
      \ in this though:\n\n- the OGG player does not obey the PATHS= settings in the\
      \ UT2003.ini file so if You have a separate directory for map developement,\
      \ You won't hear Your music - for some reason it has to be placed in the same\
      \ folder as the rest of the OGG files.\n\n- trying to play the OGG in the editor\
      \ will crash-boom-bang\n\nNow, to create the OGG files You need an OGG capable\
      \ converter. One that is freeware and works can be found [http://www.dbpoweramp.com/\
      \ here].\n\nIt is not recommended to rip music off of music CD's - instead You\
      \ can create/use MIDI and convert it to WAV using [http://www.modplug.com/index.php3\
      \ ModPlug tracker]. The WAV is then again easy to convert into OGG.\n:<b>Note:</b>\
      \ this is completely unnecessary. If you want to use a piece of music on a CD,\
      \ run it through WinAmp and output it to OGG format. Done deal. MIDI is extremely\
      \ unreliable, as the sounds you hear on one computer can vary widely from the\
      \ sounds you hear on another, and converting to WAV is an unnecessary step.\n\
      \nA more widely used alternative is the Oggdrop utility. Download it [http://www.vorbis.com/download_win.psp\
      \ here]. Start it and just drag the wav file onto it and it will encode it for\
      \ you. Right click on it to alter options like bitrate, quality, mono/stereo\
      \ etc. I (Hawkeye) prefer OggdropXPD myself which is the exact same tool but\
      \ with more options. Highly recommended for it's speed, versatility and ease\
      \ of use.\n\n* some more stuff... (Ogg Vorbis links etc.)\n\nTo be edited:\n\
      * How to import MIDIs &ndash; <i>GAH!  I'm wetting my pants in anticipation!\
      \  Using Midis would be FANTASTIC for this thing I'm working on.  &ndash; Cap</i>\n\
      :Heh, as far as I know, UEd supports MODs, so importing a MIDI into a MOD should\
      \ work. But when I do this, the music won't play, because the samples aren't\
      \ imported. This used to work with previous MPT versions... There's a discussion\
      \ about this at the [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?threadid=112412\

      \ of the old UT tracker style music into Ogg format so you can use it in your\
      \ UT2003/2004 maps for a little reminiscing :-) Mail me at bmw5002 at optonline\
      \ dot net if you want 'em.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I just found out you could import\
      \ music into .U files with this line in a .UC file:<uscript>\n#exec NEW MUSICFACTORY\
      \ FILE=\"...\" NAME=\"...\"</uscript>\n\n'''Birelli:''' I think we should split\
      \ this page by first paraphrasing everything into a quick and clean explanation\
      \ of how to do things, and then link to pages with some of this \"''extremely''\
      \ in-depth info\" ;-).\n\n'''Wormbo:''' This page definately needs some work.\n\
      \n'''RDGDanClark:''' I'm not a total expert on music in Unreal Engine games,\
      \ but I'll see what I can do here.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' This page has a lot of repetition\
      \ and redundancy. I'll add the [[:Category:Legacy Refactor Me]].\n\n'''Nuleo:'''\
      \ The Ogg Vorbis format really sucks.  Even though it has a higher compression\
      \ ratio, even at the highest quality, it sounds muffled, scratchy, and less\
      \ bright than mp3s or wavs and I have composed about 12 minutes of music so\
      \ far for a UT2003 Total Conversion.  I think this is part of the reason why\
      \ the UT2003 soundtrack isn't very good.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' In theory, Ogg Vorbis\
      \ is a lossless compression format so it shouldn't sound any different. It's\
      \ possible that the decoder built in to UT2003 is not very good. In UT at least,\
      \ there was a major difference between the music in-game and the same music\
      \ files played using Winamp or Sonique, so maybe this is kind of the same deal.\n\
      \n'''MythOpus:'''  Well, are you refering to the add-on music player in ut2k3\
      \ or some other thing ?\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' No, I mean that UT did not produce\
      \ a completely faithful playback of the actual MOD file that was supposedly\
      \ being played as music. This was not a flaw in the format, simply a consequence\
      \ of UT's playback mechanism. Similarly, the Ogg Vorbis files may sounds bad\
      \ in UT2003, but I highly, highly doubt that it is the fault of the format.\
      \ As far as I know, an Ogg Vorbis file decoded should be completely identical\
      \ to the source waveform.\n\n'''Nuleo:''' Ogg files are not completely identical\
      \ to their source (.wav or other) files.  And the quality of the ogg files is\
      \ still worse than the mp3s even when played in Winamp.  Probably cause the\
      \ mp3 format has been around longer so better mp3 encoders are available.\n\n\
      '''Wormbo:''' It all depends on the bitrate used. At the same bitrate an OGG\
      \ sounds better than an MP3. Try e.g. 64kb/s, you'll definately notice the effect.\n\
      \n'''Hawkeye:''' Ogg Vorbis is much better than mp3 at equal bitrate. This is\
      \ true at both low (32-64) and high (192-up) bitrates.\n\nTrust me on this.\
      \ I ripped 500 Audio CD's first in mp3 and changed to ogg because they sound\
      \ much better than mp3 at equal or slightly lower bitrates.\n\n'''Graphik:'''\
      \ I cleaned a little before realizing the futility. This page needs a complete\
      \ rewrite.\n\n'''Birelli:''' Ok, I moved the info on [[Legacy:Music Modules|Music\
      \ Modules]] to it's own page. This makes the page a lot easier to read, and\
      \ really all that info belongs on it's own page. I think next is to re-write\
      \ the \"assigning music to maps\" and move it towards the top of the page. Maybe\
      \ even it's own page, this is really the only info most people care about.\n\
      \n'''Birelli:''' Alright, I think I've finally got things in at least somewhat\
      \ working order. Nowhere on this page was there a description of how to import\
      \ a music file into your map. The [[Legacy:Importing Music|Importing Music]]\
      \ page has what used to be the \"Importing Music\" section of this page, but\
      \ it doesn't seem to actually instruct how to import music. Probably that page's\
      \ content should be moved to another page about the different formats available\
      \ and replaced with a nice tutorial about how to import a music file into the\
      \ music browser.\n\nAnyway, is everyone happy with this current structure? If\
      \ so let's work inside it to polish things up. It's not done yet, but it's at\
      \ least understandable. In particular the discussion of the OGG file format\
      \ needs to be cleaned up and probably moved up under the \"latest engine file\
      \ formats\" or even onto its own page about the OGG format.\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
