      \ a popular one in 3DS Max, which is not far from the mark with most 3D softwares\
      \ is to make a basic primitive, such as a cube, teselate the faces, move them\
      \ to their approximate locations and then subdivide the surface, refine the\
      \ vertex positions, and recurse the process to your desired level of detail.\
      \ To do this with max, make your basic shape and then right click it, convert\
      \ it to an editable poly, from here you can extrude, bevel, etc... the surfaces\
      \ as well as many other things, you can use HSDS to make your subdivisions as\
      \ I did in my main tutorial, most people prefer just to use the Mesh Smooth\
      \ or Subdivide modifiers from the list, HSDS imo does result in a more optimized\
      \ final product, but there would be many who would disagree.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ rather than color, the thought did cross my mind though that you could use\

      \ you need to do this to make your models import into UTEd, I kind of remember\
      \ when I first started to import my own content a few weeks ago that I ommited\
      \ this step, not certain exactly if this was the cause, but the model did not\
      \ import.</p>\n<p>You can also use Multi/Sub-Object materials in 3DS Max to\
      \ futher increase your palette of texture maps, and assign them by using Mesh\
      \ Selects, and Material modifiers, and manipulate them with many other modifiers,\
      \ such as UVW Map.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Export_the_object\"\

      \ need to make sure you export are the vertex colors, the mesh normals and mapping\
      \ co-ordinates, the mesh defintion and materials in the object types section,\
      \ I normally just export everything and UTEd sort things out on its end, set\
      \ the decimal precision appropriately, I don't think you really need to change\
      \ this, 1 unit is like a centimeter, and 3 decimal places is like 0.01 milimeters,\
      \ but if your like me - you'll knock it up just to be un the safe side, I believe\
      \ UT3 sheds a lot of the detail unless you have a tick in a check box - not\
      \ certian of this - but I do know it is the case with UV co-ords at least.</p>\n\
