  title: "Legacy:Alpha Channel"
  text:
    text: "<p>An <b>alpha channel</b>, also sometimes called a mask, controls the\
      \ transparency of an image. In programs like Lightwave and 3D Studio, the image\
      \ and its alpha channel can be separate image files, but most image formats\
      \ store the alpha channel information within the main image file. For <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Texture_Import_And_Export\" title=\"Legacy:Texture Import And Export\"\
      >importing to UnrealEd</a>, it's best to use 32 bit <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGA\"\
      \ class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:TGA\">Wikipedia:TGA</a> (Targa) files.</p>\n\
      <p>Alpha channels use black for transparent areas, and white for opaque areas.\
      \ Files that are only black and white are sometimes called masks. An example\
      \ might be an image of a tree where the trunk, branches, and leaves are visible\
      \ but everything else is \"invisible\" or transparent.</p>\n<p>They can also\
      \ be used to make gradual shifts in transparency such as with the simulated\
      \ glow of coronas and particles. Since black is transparent, a dark grey (eg,\
      \ RGB 10,10,10) is mostly transparent but not completely.</p>\n<p>Alpha channels\
      \ are used to simulate 3D geometry without increasing the number of physical\
      \ polygons. For example, a picket fence would require modeling individual boards\
      \ and nails while an alpha channel image fence would simply contain and image\
      \ of a fence and its alpha channel; transparent areas around the top and between\
      \ individual fence boards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\">\n<div\

      \ extensive use of texture modifiers, e.g. you can use a <a href=\"/Legacy:Combiner\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Combiner\">Combiner</a> to combine the colors of one texture\
      \ with the alpha map of a different texture. With a <a href=\"/Legacy:FinalBlend\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:FinalBlend\">FinalBlend</a> modifier you can create an alpha\
      \ channel based on a texture's brightness (like the render style STY_Translucent\
      \ in <a href=\"/Legacy:UT\" title=\"Legacy:UT\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UT</a>)\
      \ and use it in a Combiner to combine texture 1 and alpha channel of that FinalBlend.\
      \ In both cases you have to apply another FinalBlend to the Combiner to make\
      \ it actually use its alpha channel.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I haven't been successful\
      \ in using the finalblend to make an alpha channel like that, but that is basically\
      \ what I was aiming for.. can you explain the process in greater detail, or\
      \ maybe make a tutorial page on how to do it?</p>\n<p><b>LegalAssassin:</b>\
      \ If you want an anti-aliased edge in PS you might experience (Geforce 2 GTS\
      \ at least) that at distances this edge will turn white (!) in UEd. This is\
      \ because of the the alpha color being white in PS. This looks bad when making,\
      \ for instance, leaves on a branch. To fix this I use PSP 7 and open a .psd-version\
      \ of the texture with the transparency as you want it. Now, make a new background\
      \ layer, fill it with a more appropriate color (for leaves, some green would\
      \ be nice) and save it as a .tga in PSP. The AA'd edge should now look good.</p>\n\
      <p>I'm sure there's a better way, but I'm learning PS by trial-and-error.</p>\n\

      \nhttp://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544\n\nMake sure\
      \ you follow the instructions given there.\n\nAlso if you're using Photoshop\
      \ you can save textures with alpha channels in [[Legacy:DXT|DXT]]3 format. It\
      \ only has a 4-bit alpha, instead of the 8-bit TGA alpha channel, but compression\
      \ with DXT is much better and in most cases quality isn't much of an issue with\
      \ alpha channels.\n\n===Paint Shop Pro ===\n# Do Main menu->Selections->Select\
      \ All, and press CTRL-C to copy the image to the clipboard.\n# Press CTRL-V\
      \ to paste it as a new image (you will be working on the cloned image first).\n\
      # Select the parts of the image you want to make transparent. The Wand selection\
      \ tool is useful for this. Hold down the shift key to select multiple parts\
      \ of the image.\n# Take your floodfill tool and select a dark colour (the darker\
      \ the colour, the more transparent the pixel will be). Floodfill within the\
      \ selected areas.\n# In the menu, do Selections->Invert. This will invert your\
      \ selection.\n# Whatever you ''do not'' want transparent is now selected.  Take\
      \ your floodfill tool and select a light colour (the lighter the colour, the\
      \ less transparent the pixel will be). Floodfill within the selected areas.\n\
      # In the menu, do 'Layers->Load/Save Mask->Save Mask to Disk'.  Type in a filename\
      \ and hit Save.\n# In the menu, click on 'Selections->Select None' to deselect\
      \ everything.\n# Reopen your original image.\n# In the menu, click on 'Selections->Select\
      \ All'.\n# In the menu, click on 'Layers->Load/Save Mask->Load Mask from Disk'and\
      \ look in the menu bar at the top of screen for Mask.  Select Mask->New->From\
      \ Image.  In this dialogue box, for the source window, the pulldown box, 'blank'\
      \ and select your masked texture's filename, and press ok.\n# Select Masks->Save\
      \ to Alpha channel from the menu.  Just agree with the next two windows (hit\
      \ 'OK'), and save your new masked image.  Make sure you choose .TGA file format\
      \ (it will be listed as Truevision TARGA (.TGA)).\n\n'''DJPaul:''' Did some\
      \ more work on this.  Fell through when I released the Beta 8 of PSP menu-wise\
      \ is much different from PSP7, so i'm stuck.  Plus my art sk1lls about suitable\
      \ for MS Paint.  I will try find someone who knows to finish it.\n\n===The GIMP===\n\
      \n# Select the parts of the image you want to be visible. (Or select what you\
      \ want to be transparent, and do Select->Invert.)\n# Do Layer->Mask->Add Layer\
      \ Mask\n## In the dialog, set Initialize Layer Mark to 'Selection'\n# You can\
      \ make further changes by painting directly on the layer mask. The layermask\
      \ is just a grayscale image; black means fully transparent and white fully opaque.\n\
      # The new mask is selected in the layer list. Before you save, click on the\
      \ original layer to select it. (Otherwise, saving will only export the grayscale\
      \ mask.)\n# When saving as TGA, the export procedure will tell you it needs\
      \ to \"Apply layer mask\". Click 'Export'.\n\nAnother way to do is it right\
      \ click on the layer and select \"Add alpha channel\" and use the Erase tool\
      \ or Edit->Clear to erase the parts you want transparent.\n\n==Importing into\
      \ UnrealEd:==\n*Be sure to check the 'alpha' checkbox when you import your texture.\
      \ If you forget to do this, you can always change it by setting the '''bAlphaTexture'''\
      \ to True in the 'surface' section of the Texture Properties window (open that\
      \ by right-clicking your texture and selecting 'properties' in the context list).\n\
      *You will know that you have created and imported the alpha texture properly\
      \ if you can see some of the texture window's background through your texture.\
      \ for example, it looks a little like this:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_AlphaTexExample.jpeg|center|Alpha\
      \ textures appear like this, with the background showing through.]]\n\nSee [[Legacy:Texture\
      \ Import And Export|Texture Import and Export]] for more information on importing\
      \ textures.\n\n==Related Topics ==\n* [[Legacy:Graphics Application|Graphics\

      \ more work on this.  Fell through when I released the Beta 8 of PSP menu-wise\
      \ is much different from PSP7, so i'm stuck.  Plus my art sk1lls about suitable\
      \ for MS Paint.  I will try find someone who knows to finish it.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ Is there a way to make a add a mask to a texture within UnrealEd? IE Set a\
      \ texture as the alpha mask for another material?\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I'm sure\
      \ this is possible through extensive use of texture modifiers, e.g. you can\
      \ use a [[Legacy:Combiner|Combiner]] to combine the colors of one texture with\
      \ the alpha map of a different texture. With a [[Legacy:FinalBlend|FinalBlend]]\
      \ modifier you can create an alpha channel based on a texture's brightness (like\
      \ the render style STY_Translucent in [[Legacy:UT|UT]]) and use it in a Combiner\
      \ to combine texture 1 and alpha channel of that FinalBlend. In both cases you\
      \ have to apply another FinalBlend to the Combiner to make it actually use its\
      \ alpha channel.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I haven't been successful in using the finalblend\
      \ to make an alpha channel like that, but that is basically what I was aiming\
      \ for.. can you explain the process in greater detail, or maybe make a tutorial\
      \ page on how to do it?\n\n'''LegalAssassin:''' If you want an anti-aliased\
      \ edge in PS you might experience (Geforce 2 GTS at least) that at distances\
      \ this edge will turn white (!) in UEd. This is because of the the alpha color\
      \ being white in PS. This looks bad when making, for instance, leaves on a branch.\
      \ To fix this I use PSP 7 and open a .psd-version of the texture with the transparency\
      \ as you want it. Now, make a new background layer, fill it with a more appropriate\
      \ color (for leaves, some green would be nice) and save it as a .tga in PSP.\
      \ The AA'd edge should now look good.\n\nI'm sure there's a better way, but\
      \ I'm learning PS by trial-and-error.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Discussion needs cleaning...\
