      Legacy:Lightbox\">lightboxes</a>.</p>\n<p>Most mappers mix lightboxes with lights\
      \ without beams. By mixing the two types, it suggests that particles reside\

      \ example. Can anyone shed some light on this problem? (groan!)</p>\n<p>More:\
      \ This morning I decided to try an experiment, so I opened LocustWind and added\
      \ 1,500 more lights to it. It took a long time to build, but build it did, and\
      \ when I loaded it up in UT, sure enough, there were all kinds of colored spots\
      \ that weren't there before, and dozens of coronas floating in midair. The final\
      \ count was nearly 3,000 lights. What does this mean for the supposed light\
      \ limit mentioned in this document? What's supposed to happen when you reach\
      \ that maximum? Will UnrealEd pop up some kind of error message or something?\
      \ It certainly seems to me that if a limit does exist, it's considerably higher\
      \ than the estimate given on this page.</p>\n<p><b>SuicideMissions{CLR}:</b>\
      \ It seems like that number (1000) is wrong. After all *any* actor can emit\
      \ light by setting its properties under Lighting and LightColor. The only way\
      \ that there could be a limit on lights is if there was a limit on instances\
      \ of Actor. What *is* limited though, is the amount of resolution available\
      \ for making light/shadow shapes on surfaces.</p>\n<p>Sigh. Lighting is soooooooooo\
      \ tedioius and really does not look very good. *IF ONLY EPIC WOULD MAKE A LIGHT\
      \ PAINTER TOOL!!!* Imagine being able to paint light directly on your 3D suraces!\
      \ They already made a terrain painting tool. Technically, I think a light painting\
      \ tool would be easier to program than a terrain painter. Basically, it would\
      \ just modify the lightmap in real time and you could select from a round brush,\
      \ square brush, and maybe a couple more complex brushes (like a \"rough\" brush\
      \ for painting surfaces that are rough). This would be so much less tedious\
      \ than using light actors, and the results would be far closer to what the artist\
      \ imagines.... just like Fine Painters!</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> The problem\
      \ (if you did not use any light actors at all in your map) is that no actors\
      \ in the level would be lit. They would all be dark black unless the particular\
      \ actor was set to unlit. Using this light painting tool with lights would cause\
      \ yet another problem. They would light both bsp and actors, but that lighting\
      \ might collide with the light you've created with the painting tool. I guess\
      \ it would be great if you could edit the light more efficiently though. For\
      \ example, telling exactly where the light beams can/can not go and how far\
      \ the light can go before it gives absolutely no light off (i.e. stop a light\
      \ beam in it's tracks in one area and not in another&#160;:D) I think the lighting\
      \ system is a lot worse now compared to that of Unreal Tournaments lighting\
      \ system though. With UT, I found there was a lot less light bleeding.</p>\n\

    text: "So you want to be hailed for great [[Legacy:Lighting|lighting]] in your\
      \ map?  You have to understand how real light works and what tools are available\
      \ in Unreal to emulate it.\n\n''This page describes techniques for UnrealEngine\
      \ 1 games. UnrealEngine 2 and above may provide better solutions for some problems\
      \ described here.''\n\n==Understanding How Light Works==\n\nSince Unreal lights\
      \ do not follow real light physics, its lighting can easily look fake.  However,\
      \ there are a variety of Unreal lights that can make lighting look real.  It\
      \ is first helpful to understand how real light works.\n\n* parallel light rays,\
      \ such as [[Legacy:Sunlight|sunlight]], create hard edged shadows\n* refracted\
      \ light rays due to overcast skies or [[Legacy:Fog|fog]] create soft edged shadows\n\
      * light fades exponentially in air (it gets darker as it distance from the source\
      \ increases)\n* light generally scatters in all directions\n* light bounces\
      \ off surfaces\n* light is absorbed by surfaces\n* light carries a surface's\
      \ color \n* light sources have a distinct color temperature\n* light sources\
      \ have a small but bright ''hotspot'' \n\n==The Primary Light Types ==\n\nAs\
      \ you master lighting with Unreal, you will find the majority of your light\
      \ combinations will be only two.  All lights will be affected by the minor tools:\n\
      * radius\n* [[Legacy:Colors|colors]] \n* brightness \n\n[[Image:Legacy_light.steady.gif|left|Light\
      \ Type: Steady, Light Type: None]]\n\nThe steady light with no effect has a\
      \ quick falloff to the unbra shadow.  Since only a small portion of the radius\
      \ is lit (what we call a hotspot) and a large portion is in shadow, it is a\
      \ good type to use for 'atmosphere' or 'mood' because it will highlight a specific\
      \ area while coloring everything around it with just enough light to make it\
      \ visible, yet dark enough to be threatening.\n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n[[Image:Legacy_light.nonincidence.gif|left|Light\
      \ Type: Steady, Light Effect: Non-Incidence]]\n\nThe opposite of the steady/none\
      \ light is the steady, non-incidence light.  It emphasizes the hotspot by spreading\
      \ it out over a wide area then quickly falling off into the shadow umbra.  It\
      \ is a good choice to light a large area smoothly without making things to light\
      \ or dark.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_light.cylinder.gif|left|Light Steady Light Effect:\
      \ Cylinder]]\n\nThe cylinder is worth mentioning because it is primarily used\
      \ when even floor lighting is desired, especially on [[Legacy:Terrain|terrain]]\
      \ in [[Legacy:UT|UT]].  However, UT2003 uses a better method with the [[Legacy:Sunlight|Sunlight]]\
      \ actor.\n\n==Faking realistic light==\n\nBy considering real light characterstics,\
      \ the following technique demonstrates how to closely mimic real lighting in\
      \ Unreal.  \n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n[[Image:Legacy_real.light1.jpeg|left|\nThis light\
      \ is used as the hotspot.  It is not showing the torch graphic because its texture\
      \ been changed to a [[Legacy:Corona|corona]] to imitate a flare.\n* Radius:\
      \ 8 (very small)\n* Brightness: 255 (100%)\n* Light Effect: Steady.  This light\
      \ type fades to shadow starting almost at the center of the light source, which\
      \ is why we cranked the brightness.  The small radius allows us to emphasize\
      \ the hotspot.\n]]\n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n[[Image:Legacy_real.light2.jpeg|left|\nThis\
      \ is our ''falloff'' light that scatters around.  \n* Radius: 12 (small)\n*\
      \ Brightness: 96 (40%)\n* Light Effect: Non-incidence.  This light type fades\
      \ light very slowly then quickly fades to shadow at the edge of the light radius.\
      \  It is a good type to use when you want to light up an area smoothly but not\
      \ overexpose surfaces.\n]]\n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n[[Image:Legacy_real.light3.jpeg|left|\n\
      This is our ''bounce'' light near the closest surface that reflects the light\
      \ back onto the scene.  If this were a different colored wall, the dominate\
      \ hue of that exture could be used on this light.  \n* Radius: 24 (medium small)\n\
      * Brightness: 72 (33%)\n* Light Effect: Non-incidence.  Same reasons. \n]]\n\
      \n{|\n\n|}\n\n====Things to Note====\n* It takes a minimum of 2 lights (hotspot\
      \ and falloff) to look good\n* Bounced light isnt necessary, but adds to the\
      \ realism effect\n* One bounce light may be used if multiple lights in an concentrated\
      \ area are used.  \n\n===Fully lit lights on Gradient Shadowed Textures===\n\
      \nIf you want a magnitude of light fixtures flush with a gradiantly shadowed\
      \ surface surface, there is a few problems that need to be solved:\n* Adding\
      \ each light fixture into the surface as a solid creates BSP cuts\n* Adding\
      \ each light fixture 1 pixel from the surface as a nonsolid is tedious.  \n\
      * Each light fixture must have its own light actor and there is a limit (around\
      \ 1000) that Unreal is limited to.\n* Each light actor will light in a spherical\
      \ or cylindrical radius, limiting your light fixture shapes and/or lighting\
      \ undesired areas.\n\nAll of these issues can be solved.\n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n[[Image:Legacy_unlit.light.mask.on.surface1.jpeg|left|]]\n\
      \n\nThe surface fades from light to shadow nicely, but the rectangular light\
      \ fixtures in shadow are darkening too. If we were to add a light for each fixture,\
      \ we would run out of lights to use very quickly.\n\n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n[[Image:Legacy_unlit.light.mask.on.surface2.jpeg|left|]]\n\
      \n\n* Add a [[Legacy:Nonsolid|nonsolid]] sheet 1 [[Legacy:Grid|grid]] unit away\
      \ from the (blue) trim brush\n* Make the sheet the same height or width as the\
      \ the trim\n\n(Remember that newer engine versions provide nifty features like\
      \ [[Legacy:Shader|Shader]]s with self-illumination texture and mask that work\
      \ a lot better than additional sheets in cases like this.)\n\n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n\
      [[Image:Legacy_unlit.light.mask.on.surface3.jpeg|left|]]\n\n\n# The trim brush\
      \ uses a texture that has the light fixture drawn in so it will appear flush\
      \ (top arrow).\n# The sheet brush uses a texture that only has the light fixture\
      \ and the rest is masked (bottom arrow). This will allow the underlying texture\
      \ to show through.\n\n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n[[Image:Legacy_unlit.light.mask.on.surface4.jpeg|left|]]\n\
      \n\n* The sheet surface is set to both to mask and unlit.  This allows the lighting\
      \ on the sheet to be full bright (keeping the lights bright) and the trim behind\
      \ the mask to show the gradient of light to shadow.\n* Only one light was used\
      \ instead of one for each light fixture.\n\n\n{|\n\n|}\n\n===Lights in a Dirty\
      \ World===\n\nWhen light is in an area of where minute particles are floating\
      \ the air, we can see the light hitting those particles, resulting in a light\
      \ beam.  3D engines dont account for air particles (yet), so they fake it. \
      \ In Unreal, they are called [[Legacy:Lightbox|lightbox]]es.  \n\nMost mappers\
      \ mix lightboxes with lights without beams.  By mixing the two types, it suggests\
      \ that particles reside in a confined space. In reality, you would have all\
      \ light sources in a given area show a beam at differnet intensities because\
      \ of the particles floating in that area.  \n\nRather than make multiple itensity\
      \ levels for various light sources, you can encompass all light sources with\
      \ [[Legacy:Fog|fog]], placing light boxes inside the area and let the fog's\
      \ density level suggest the particle boundary.\n\n===Sky Light===\n\nThis is\
      \ the easiest method for creating nice shadows.  Creating a skybox and sticking\
      \ a grated (or glass criss-crossed with some sort of grating) window works with\
      \ just about any (indoor) theme.  Once you've constructed the beams and grate\
      \ architecture, stick a light behind them on the skybox surface.  Change its\
      \ brightness, radius and light type and the beams will cast shadows onto your\
      \ walls and floor.\n\n===Wall Lights===\n\nAbout the only thing I can think\
      \ of for creating shadows in this sense is to make a corridor with pillars or\
      \ supports running down it.  Put lights in between each pillar with high brightness\
      \ and low radii.  Rebuild, and watch as each light spills out from the pillar\
      \ and there is a shadowy area between the lights.\n\n===Spotlights===\n\n===Hard\
      \ shadows===\n\n===Cylindrical lighting===\n* When it can be useful\n\n==Conclusion==\n\
      \nTo create shadows just about anywhere, just use high brightness, low radius\
      \ lights.  They'll light a small area, making a sharp contrast between that\
      \ light and the darker areas around it.  Just make sure that you allow enough\
      \ light for gameplay purposes instead of focusing on atmosphere alone.  Darkness\
      \ may be cool in single-player maps, but in multiplayer maps, it's best to give\
      \ the players some light.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Lighting|Lighting]]\

      \ Basics|Lighting Basics]] helpful\n* Learn how to avoid [[Legacy:Lightmap Errors|lightmap\

      \  :)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Seems like a good idea :)\n\n'''Sobiwan:''' I read somewhere\
      \ that you weren't good at lighting.  If that's true, we're gunna change all\
      \ that!  :)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' My problem is that the hotspot light never looks\
      \ quite right - it always lights up things around the light fitting or even\
      \ behind it, that shouldn't be. Nice terminology, by the way &ndash; \"hotspot\"\
      , etc. Makes it easier to absorb. Plus I find lighting so tedious and slow &ndash;\
      \ make tiny change, rebuild lighting... it still sucks, make tiny change, rebuild....etc\n\
      \n'''Sobiwan:''' Have you tried [[Legacy:Special Lit|special lit]] to control\
      \ where light goes?\n\n'''Sobiwan:''' merged \"Shadows\" here.\n\n'''Ironblayde:'''\
      \ Gah! There's a maximum on the number of light actors you can use? Can anyone\
      \ confirm what this is, exactly, and whether there are any sneaky workaround\
      \ aside from the one mentioned above? I'm going to be ''way'' over 1,000 at\
      \ the rate I'm going on my map (UT, UnrealEd 2). :shocked: I know I've seen\
      \ some maps over 1,000 before. CTF-LocustWind has 1,384, for example. Can anyone\
      \ shed some light on this problem? (groan!)\n\nMore: This morning I decided\
      \ to try an experiment, so I opened LocustWind and added 1,500 more lights to\
      \ it. It took a long time to build, but build it did, and when I loaded it up\
      \ in UT, sure enough, there were all kinds of colored spots that weren't there\
      \ before, and dozens of coronas floating in midair. The final count was nearly\
      \ 3,000 lights. What does this mean for the supposed light limit mentioned in\
      \ this document? What's supposed to happen when you reach that maximum? Will\
      \ UnrealEd pop up some kind of error message or something? It certainly seems\
      \ to me that if a limit does exist, it's considerably higher than the estimate\
      \ given on this page.\n\n'''SuicideMissions{CLR}:''' It seems like that number\
      \ (1000) is wrong. After all *any* actor can emit light by setting its properties\
      \ under Lighting and LightColor. The only way that there could be a limit on\
      \ lights is if there was a limit on instances of Actor. What *is* limited though,\
      \ is the amount of resolution available for making light/shadow shapes on surfaces.\n\
      \nSigh. Lighting is soooooooooo tedioius and really does not look very good.\
      \ *IF ONLY EPIC WOULD MAKE A LIGHT PAINTER TOOL!!!* Imagine being able to paint\
      \ light directly on your 3D suraces! They already made a terrain painting tool.\
      \ Technically, I think a light painting tool would be easier to program than\
      \ a terrain painter. Basically, it would just modify the lightmap in real time\
      \ and you could select from a round brush, square brush, and maybe a couple\
      \ more complex brushes (like a \"rough\" brush for painting surfaces that are\
      \ rough). This would be so much less tedious than using light actors, and the\
      \ results would be far closer to what the artist imagines.... just like Fine\
      \ Painters!\n\n'''MythOpus:''' The problem (if you did not use any light actors\
      \ at all in your map) is that no actors in the level would be lit.  They would\
      \ all be dark black unless the particular actor was set to unlit.  Using this\
      \ light painting tool with lights would cause yet another problem.  They would\
      \ light both bsp and actors, but that lighting might collide with the light\
      \ you've created with the painting tool.  I guess it would be great if you could\
      \ edit the light more efficiently though.  For example, telling exactly where\
      \ the light beams can/can not go and how far the light can go before it gives\
      \ absolutely no light off (i.e. stop a light beam in it's tracks in one area\
      \ and not in another :D)  I think the lighting system is a lot worse now compared\
      \ to that of Unreal Tournaments lighting system though.  With UT, I found there\
      \ was a lot less light bleeding.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n\
