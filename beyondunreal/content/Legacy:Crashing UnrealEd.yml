      \ will crash. Fix: use the <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Replacement_Tool\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Texture Replacement Tool\">Texture Replacement Tool</a> before deleting\
      \ a texture. (Even if you don't see the texture, it might be used on an invisible\
      \ surface of a brush.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several ways to crash\
      \ UED if you are not careful when deleting or renaming textures, they are:\n\
      <ol>\n<li>Deleting a texture that is in use - if you delete a texture that is\
      \ in use, UED will crash if you try to save or look at the texture in the 3D\
      \ view (this is really tough, you're moving around and all of a sudden it hangs).\
      \ The correct way to do this is to first make sure that the texture is not in\
      \ use <i>Anywhere</i> in the map (including surfaces you can't see!), and then\
      \ delete the texture. If you have used the texture a lot and are not sure where\
      \ all it is, then you can use the texture replacing tool, or test if you have\
      \ gotten rid of the texture entirely by performing a <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Cull\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Texture Cull\">texture cull</a>, which will also remove the\
      \ texture for you.</li>\n<li>Delete a texture and then rename another texture\
      \ to be the deleted texture's name - I'm not quite sure of the specifics, but\
      \ if you want to do this delete the old texture, save, and re-open the map,\
      \ then rename the other file. Better yet if you are simply replacing a texture\
      \ import the new one right over the old one.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>Importing a file of .bmp or .pcx type that is NOT in indexed 8-bit color\
      \ format will crash the editor with a General Protection Fault. (I'm not sure\
      \ you can actually save a .bmp in RGB color mode or anything else besides indexed\
      \ but I know for a fact that Photoshop is quite willing to save a .pcx in RGB\
      \ color mode).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>In UnrealED 3, many time importing a texture\
      \ with the same name, overwriting a previous texture, and then using the same\
      \ type of DXTC compression to compress the texture gives a crash. Possible workarounds\
      \ would be compressing the texture before importing.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>This\
      \ won't crash UED, but it'll make your map completely unplayable, saving the\
      \ MyLevel package as a texture package, or SM package, etc. So far i have found\
      \ no remedy for this.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a new Raw material derived\
      \ from itself. (eg. Creating a TexPanner which Pans itself).<br />\nWhen creating\
      \ a new raw material the Texture browser will automatically select this new\
      \ material. This is a common trap for people who:<br />\nselect the derivative\
      \ material from the Texture Browser -&gt; Create the new material -&gt; Click\
      \ the <i>Use</i> button to use the selected derivative material. The correct\
      \ procedure is as follows:<br />\nCreate the new material -&gt; select the derivative\
      \ material from the Texture Browser -&gt; Click the <i>Use</i> button to use\
      \ the selected derivative material.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ original packages that come with your game is a general no no, unless you\
      \ A. have a license and B. are making a totally new game. What most people do\
      \ is build upon the default packages by extending actors within the default\
      \ packages. An example would be having a Sphere as an actor in a default package\
      \ and you want to create a basketball. You would 'extend' the Sphere actor from\
      \ the default package and make the new Basketball class in your own custom package\
      \ (I.E. MyBasketball.u).</p>\n<p>I hope this helps... Also... about the error\
      \ itself, I think it has to do with the importing of the source code that you\
      \ had recompiled... or the absense of that native source code all together (The\
      \ C Headers)</p>\n<p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b> Thanks. I do know about object\
      \ oriented programmming, but the default packages are rebuilt when you run UCC,\
      \ right? That's all I meant. People must think I am going around promoting screwing\
      \ with the defualt packages, what with this and the page I made, <a href=\"\

      \ I really am not. I do know that it's bad.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Heh...\
      \ actually UCC doesn't actually rebuild any package unless the .u for that package\
      \ has been deleted. Therefore, normally UCC only checks to see if the packages\
      \ are still there. If they are, it goes to the next package in the list until\
      \ it finds an EditPackage string that has no .u package. Then it looks for the\
      \ source (the folder that holds the .uc files) of that package and uses that\
      \ to compile a new package.</p>\n<p><b>StarWeaver:</b> Got a new one (I think,\
      \ anyway): Changing a <a href=\"/Legacy:Projector\" title=\"Legacy:Projector\"\
      >Projector</a> (In my case it's always been position or rotation, both by dragging\

      \ (My vague guess from the call chain would be the propertly list getting corrupted\

      \ it would use the same operations as a cut or copy or duplicate . . . )</p>\n\

    text: "Common UnrealEd Crashes: Easily Avoidable Tragedies\n\n==General ==\n\n\
      * Don't put lights into the solid space because it will cause crashes.\n* At\
      \ least on Win2K Pro, right-clicking on the desktop and changing Appearance\
      \ -> Schemes will crash the editor.\n* When setting the Light Color (Button\
      \ in UEd 2) don't click on any of the viewports. If you do, the Editor will\
      \ crash.\n* Don't try to do \"Convert -> Static Mesh\" on a static mesh. ;)\n\
      * Doing Edit -> undo too many times in a row usually results in a crash\n* Don't\
      \ right click on a viewport and select View-> show fluid surfaces if there is\
      \ no fluid surfaces in your level.\n* When in [[Legacy:Terrain Mode|Terrain\
      \ Mode]] don't select a HUGE area with the vertex editing tool and try to move\
      \ it. Because you are trying to move so many vertices at the same time UnrealEd\
      \ will most likely crash or freeze up.\n* Creating a Warp Zone to itself will\
      \ cause a big crash!\n\n==Brushes and vertices ==\n* When you are vertex editing\
      \ be careful and don't cross the edges of polygons and don't overlap two or\
      \ more vertices. If you overlap the vertices you won't be able to separate them\
      \ afterwards and if the overlapping reduces the facecount of the object then\
      \ UEd will instantly crash after you release the mouse button moving the vertex.\n\
      ** Save a lot when you are using the BSP based terrain brush.\n** Keep a close\
      \ eye on what you move and where\n** If you are using the Vertex mode the sensitivity\
      \ of the movement depends on the grid setting you use. Certain grid settings\
      \ will need a steady hand and lots of concentration.\n\n* Don't try to select\
      \ a surface's underlying brush with SHIFT+Left-Click if the brush has been deleted\
      \ (see [[Legacy:Mouse Control|Mouse Control]] for more on this function).\n\n\
      * Don't duplicate a brush that's smaller than the current grid size, or equal\
      \ and off-grid.\n\n* If you must put a tetrahedron (sphere) brush into your\
      \ map, don't set the extrapolation value above 3 or 4. This results in a hugely\
      \ complex brush shape that not only tears the [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]] to shreds but\
      \ also is likely to cause a crash when you try to add or subtract it.\n\n==2D\
      \ Shape Editor ==\n* Don't cross edges in the [[Legacy:2D Shape Editor|2D Shape\
      \ Editor]]. When you try to extrude the shape UEd will crash.\n* UnrealEd 2\
      \ can be crashed by importing a texture file into the 2D Shape Editor incorrectly\
      \ (and, this happens unexpectedly). When you open the 2D Shape Editor and attempt\
      \ to import a door texture with the intent of transferring the exact dimension\
      \ to a 3D Brush, you can crash UnrealEd by doing [[Legacy:2D Shape Editor Menu|2D\
      \ Shape Editor Menu]] -> File -> Image -> Get From Current Texture. The behavior\
      \ of the 2D Shape Editor is inconsistent, sometimes the above mentioned technique\
      \ works, sometimes it doesn't. (This suggestion from Machismo) The solution\
      \ is that the 2D Shape Editor can only open ''.bmp'' textures. So, when you\
      \ have the desired texture selected in the Texture Browser, right click the\
      \ texture and select, ''Export to .pcx''. In the Save Dialog window, select,\
      \ ''Save as Type > All File Types'', and save the file as a (unique name) ''.bmp''\
      \ file. Then, from within the 2D Shape Editor, select, [[Legacy:2D Shape Editor\
      \ Menu|2D Shape Editor Menu]] -> File -> Image -> Get From Disk and, import.\n\
      \n:'''Tarquin:'''  I've never had this problem, some people say it's frequent.\
      \ Could it be OS-related? I've just seen a post on TO about this occuring after\
      \ a switch to win2k.\n:'''Daemonica:''' I don't think it's Win2K, a few of us\
      \ use it here with no problems, it's a useful and often used tool.\n:'''Legal:'''\
      \ I don't get it with UED2 but with 3. It must be teh G0bl1n :p\n\n==Textures\
      \ ==\n* If you delete a texture that is in use UEd will crash. Fix: use the\
      \ [[Legacy:Texture Replacement Tool|Texture Replacement Tool]] before deleting\
      \ a texture. (Even if you don't see the texture, it might be used on an invisible\
      \ surface of a brush.)\n\n* There are several ways to crash UED if you are not\
      \ careful when deleting or renaming textures, they are:\n*# Deleting a texture\
      \ that is in use - if you delete a texture that is in use, UED will crash if\
      \ you try to save or look at the texture in the 3D view (this is really tough,\
      \ you're moving around and all of a sudden it hangs). The correct way to do\
      \ this is to first make sure that the texture is not in use ''Anywhere'' in\
      \ the map (including surfaces you can't see!), and then delete the texture.\
      \ If you have used the texture a lot and are not sure where all it is, then\
      \ you can use the texture replacing tool, or test if you have gotten rid of\
      \ the texture entirely by performing a [[Legacy:Texture Cull|texture cull]],\
      \ which will also remove the texture for you.\n*# Delete a texture and then\
      \ rename another texture to be the deleted texture's name - I'm not quite sure\
      \ of the specifics, but if you want to do this delete the old texture, save,\
      \ and re-open the map, then rename the other file. Better yet if you are simply\
      \ replacing a texture import the new one right over the old one.\n\n*Importing\
      \ a file of .bmp or .pcx type that is NOT in indexed 8-bit color format will\
      \ crash the editor with a General Protection Fault. (I'm not sure you can actually\
      \ save a .bmp in RGB color mode or anything else besides indexed but I know\
      \ for a fact that Photoshop is quite willing to save a .pcx in RGB color mode).\n\
      \n*In UnrealED 3, many time importing a texture with the same name, overwriting\
      \ a previous texture, and then using the same type of DXTC compression to compress\
      \ the texture gives a crash. Possible workarounds would be compressing the texture\
      \ before importing.\n\n*This won't crash UED, but it'll make your map completely\
      \ unplayable, saving the MyLevel package as a texture package, or SM package,\
      \ etc. So far i have found no remedy for this.\n\n*Creating a new Raw material\
      \ derived from itself. (eg. Creating a TexPanner which Pans itself). <br />When\
      \ creating a new raw material the Texture browser will automatically select\
      \ this new material. This is a common trap for people who: <br />select the\
      \ derivative material from the Texture Browser -> Create the new material ->\
      \ Click the ''Use'' button to use the selected derivative material. The correct\
      \ procedure is as follows: <br />Create the new material -> select the derivative\
      \ material from the Texture Browser -> Click the ''Use'' button to use the selected\
      \ derivative material. \n\n==Sounds ==\n* Adding a modified ''AmbientSound''\
      \ to your level, when the file size becomes too big for the Unreal Engine (Can\
      \ this be accurately quantified?) will cause both Unreal Tournament and the\
      \ Unreal Editor to crash. Typically, this is a file mixed with [[Legacy:ModPlug\
      \ Tracker|ModPlug Tracker]] and converted to ''.wav'' format. (I will add a\
      \ better explanation later)\n\n* Adding a custom sound to your level without\
      \ importing it properly ( and, I don't know the correct technique for this)\
      \ will cause a ''General Protection Fault''. The level design will then be unplayable,\
      \ even if you delete the Ambient Sound. The recommended techniques in various\
      \ tutorials, does not work as advertised. (I will research this and find the\
      \ TRUTH.)\n\n* Importing sounds with 44KHz 16bit quality and above is not firmly\
      \ supported by UE1 and playback of such is almost certain crash case. Upper\
      \ recommended limit for sounds is either 44KHz 8bit (if you really care for\
      \ those highest frequencies) or 32KHz 16bit (if less noise is a priority).\n\
      \n==Terrain==\n* [[Legacy:Terrain Texture Layer|Terrain texture layer]]s do\
      \ not like being rectangular.\n* Do not use the terrain smoothing tool near\
      \ the edges of terrain. \n\n==BSP Rebuild Options ==\n* Which settings in the\
      \ [[Legacy:Build|Build]] window can safely be changed? \n** Anything in the\
      \ Optimization section. Avoid at all cost the BSP Rebuild Options section. People\
      \ have completely killed UnrealEd by changing these. (This seems to be what\
      \ everyone quotes, but you can quite safely change the sliders without destroying\
      \ the editor. They are also set back to the default settings when you next load\
      \ UED, so you can just reload the editor if anything goes wrong)\n** Changing\
      \ the first slider alters the amount of BSP cuts that are made. I don't know\
      \ the exact effects of this, only that setting it to the highest level gives\
      \ a ridiculous amount of BSP cuts and setting it to \"Minimise Cuts\" does exactly\
      \ that. Mess with it a bit if there's a BSP error that you absoloutly can't\
      \ get rid of, or lower this slider if your node count is far too high.\n** The\
      \ second slider adjusts how zone portals are handled when rebuilding bsp. Very\
      \ rarely, a zone portal won't zone off an area, even if it completly seals it.\
      \ Setting this slider closer to the \"Portals cut all\" option should fix this\
      \ problem. Setting the slider to \"Ignore Portals\" will increase the chance\
      \ that the ed won't zone an area off (don't know what the point of that is)\n\

      \ Mapping FAQ|Unreal Mapping FAQ]]\n* [[Legacy:Unreal Mapping FAQ (UT)|Unreal\
      \ Mapping FAQ (UT)]]\n\n==Comments ==\n\nWhenever I set all the rendering options\
      \ in advanced properties to true and then select show all actors, the editor\
      \ runs fine until i move the camera through a wall and outside of the level,\
      \ it then jams and when i close it (with Ctrl, Alt + delete) i get an error\
      \ in different parts of the level. &ndash;''ProjectX''\n\n'''Daid303:''' Creating\
      \ an [[Legacy:Inline Object|inline object]] in the [[Legacy:Default Properties|Default\
      \ properties]] of any actor in the [[Legacy:Actor Browser|Actor browser]] also\

      \ that emits particles with high acceleration values and lifespan. UnrealEd\
      \ will decide to eat up more and more memory (more than usual) and doesn't respond\
      \ anymore.\n\n'''Winxprules:''' I hope you can help me here... When I go to\
      \ build my map, UnrealEd crashes when it comes to Illumination Occluding. I'm\
      \ guessing that illumination has something to do with the lighting, but I just\
      \ wanted to check. If you could help, I'd appreciate it very much. Thanks.\n\
      \n'''Winxprules:''' Never mind... I managed to fix my problem by deleting every\
      \ last light from the level. It took a while but it was well worth it ;)\n\n\
      '''Tarquin:''' Save yourself time if you ever have to do this again: see [[Legacy:Actor\
      \ Context Menu|Actor Context Menu]] -> Select all <class>.\n\n'''Winxprules:'''\
      \ Thanks for the tip, Tarquin :)\n\n'''DataCable:''' This may be game-specific,\
      \ but the UEd 1 bundled with DS9:TF will crash if you have no object(s) selected\
      \ and simply move the cursor over the title bar of an already-opened properties\
      \ window.  Took a while to realize that this was causing otherwise seemingly\
      \ random crashes.\n\n'''Leggy:''' Is it me, or does putting many lights on the\
      \ grid cause the editor to crash to the desktop during Illumination occuluding\
      \ sometimes? I had a map that just would't build, and I selected all the lights\
      \ and moved them by less than a grid unit in each direction, and now it works\
      \ perfectly.\n\n'''Bob_The_Beheader:''' Hmm...It's kind of hard to tell why\
      \ UEd crashes when it happens while it's starting up. It's just given me this\
      \ error while the splash screen is showing:\n\n{{innerbox|Build UT2004_Build_[2005-02-15_17.02]\n\
      \n}}\n\n{{innerbox|OS: Windows XP 5.1 (Build: 2600)\n\nCPU: GenuineIntel Unknown\

      \ recently started learning to code UnrealScript, and so I've rebuilt packages\
      \ and stuff, maybe that has someting to do with why it crashes? \n\n'''MythOpus:'''\
      \ Well Bob, in UnrealScript recompiling the original packages that come with\
      \ your game is a general no no, unless you A.  have a license and B. are making\
      \ a totally new game.  What most people do is build upon the default packages\
      \ by extending actors within the default packages.  An example would be having\
      \ a Sphere as an actor in a default package and you want to create a basketball.\
      \  You would 'extend' the Sphere actor from the default package and make the\
      \ new Basketball class in your own custom package (I.E. MyBasketball.u).\n\n\
      I hope this helps...  Also...  about the error itself, I think it has to do\
      \ with the importing of the source code that you had recompiled... or the absense\
      \ of that native source code all together (The C Headers)\n\n'''Bob_The_Beheader:'''\
      \ Thanks. I do know about object oriented programmming, but the default packages\
      \ are rebuilt when you run UCC, right? That's all I meant. People must think\
      \ I am going around promoting screwing with the defualt packages, what with\
      \ this and the page I made, [[Legacy:Actors_Snap_By_Default|Actors_Snap_By_Default]].\
      \ I really am not. I do know that it's bad.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Heh... actually\
      \ UCC doesn't actually rebuild any package unless the .u for that package has\
      \ been deleted.  Therefore, normally UCC only checks to see if the packages\
      \ are still there.  If they are, it goes to the next package in the list until\
      \ it finds an EditPackage string that has no .u package.  Then it looks for\
      \ the source (the folder that holds the .uc files) of that package and uses\
      \ that to compile a new package.\n\n'''StarWeaver:''' Got a new one (I think,\

      \ and then using Undo causes a GPF. (My vague guess from the call chain would\
      \ be the propertly list getting corrupted on read or write to the undo history\
      \ . . . which is odd, because I'd think it would use the same operations as\
      \ a cut or copy or duplicate . . . )\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Or how about adding\
      \ a property definition ''above'' the list of other definitions, while an object\
      \ of that class already exists, with those properties configured, in the current\
      \ map space.  Hit compile and GPF.  Solution: remove the object or simply clear\
      \ out the property settings.\n\n'''Hellkeeper:''' \"Don't try to run UEd 2 and\
      \ UEd 3 at the same time, most likely all hell breaks loose. (Or one of them\
      \ just crashes. )\". Hum, I frequently run Ued 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 at the same\
      \ time, copy/pasting brush from one to another without problem (except tremendous\
      \ amount of HOM everywhere). They do not crash until I do stupid things (converting\
      \ a pawn to static mesh, this mesh to brush, and copying it to Unrealed 1.0).\n\
      \n'''Kirk:''' I encountered the illumination occluding related crash as well,\
      \ after making a set of very large and narrow brushes. Perhaps the lightmap\
      \ for the BSP generated for the brush (in this particular case) was too large/disproportionate\
      \ or something. In any case, splitting the brushes in two got rid of the crash.\
      \ Perhaps useful to some.\n\n'''JeffMOD:'''I keep getting the following messsgaes\

      \ UnrealEd of Repubic Commando: when I try to edit some default properties (generally\
      \ this is text parameters) in Actor Classes, UnrealEd crashes. It is very strange.\
      \ Please tell me, what is the cause of this crashing? Forgive me for my bad\
      \ English (I'm from Ukraine).\n\n'''EQ²:''' With respect to the error posted\
      \ by JeffMOD above, I've found the cause of this error in UnrealEd 3.0 to be\
      \ \"un-docking\" the Static Mesh browser from the tabbed container window. It\
      \ seems that you can un-dock all windows '''except''' the Static Mesh browser!\
      \ So if you, like me, like to undock all the windows so you can tile them on\
      \ other monitor(s), un-dock all of them except for the Static Mesh browser.\
      \ To fix this error, open up UnrealEd.ini (or MyUnrealEd.ini if using the U2\
      \ editor), find the [Static Mesh Browser] section, and delete the line which\
      \ says Docked=0. Hope this helps someone.\n\n'''Falcao:'''With respect to the\
      \ error posted by JeffMOD above. To fix this error, open the file \"unrealed.ini\"\
      , find the [Static Mesh Browser] section and change the value of \"docked\"\
      \ to 1.\n\n'''Pegasus:''' Inspecting an Emitter that has one of its objects'\
      \ UseDirectionAs property (found in the Sprite subcategory within the actor's\
      \ Emitter category via the properties dialog) set to any value either containing\
      \ \"right\" (meaning either PDTU_Right or PDTU_RightAndNormal) or PDTU_Scale\
      \ seems to crash UEd when attempting to switch to that particular object's tab\
      \ in the Particle Editor. A characteristic example of this are the jumppad emitters\
      \ in ONS-Tanks-A-Lot-)o(-V4, for which a quick fix entails changing their UseDirectionAs\
      \ property to PTDU_Up and then enabling Spin Particles from inside the Particle\
      \ Editor's Rotation section to achieve the same visual result of upward spark\
      \ movement.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n[[Category:Legacy Troubleshooting|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n\
