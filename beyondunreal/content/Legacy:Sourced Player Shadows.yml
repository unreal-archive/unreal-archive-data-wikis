      >Read about it here, and try it if you have a second</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ I didn't really follow that checklist you made but I tested lots of stuff\
      \ anyway.. I'm not quite sure the exact terminology because I haven't experimented\
      \ with the classes, I just downloaded the demo map to see if I could help you\
      \ find the bugs.&#160;:P Anyways, here were my observations: (I supercompressed\
      \ the JPEGs, so the image quality is very poor, but it should still be enough\
      \ to illustrate the bug.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The area with the three squares on\
      \ the wall with the A shadows spinning around, the Scripted Shadow/Static Mesh\
      \ and Scripted Shadow/BSP flickered at some angles. There was a discernable\
      \ pattern in the flickering, which varies based on the angle. The Shadow Bitmap\
      \ square did not flicker.</li>\n<li>Switching tasks while playing causes the\
      \ shadows to be garbled upon switching back. This rectifies itself in the next\
      \ tick. This affects both the wall shadows and player shadows.</li>\n<li>The\
      \ square/sphere combo shadowbitmap and plain appeared fine, though the shadowbitmap\
      \ one exhibited the task switching glitch detailed above.</li>\n<li>The \"scripted\"\
      \ square/sphere combo did not experience this glitch, but would go nearly completely\
      \ flat grey right when I got to the point that the shadow started to be projected\
      \ on my pawn. The shadow was projected on the pawn properly when this occurred,\
      \ however.</li>\n<li>The \"scriptedShadow\" square/sphere combo flickered madly,\
      \ though with a discernable pattern. At first this appeared independant of the\
      \ angle. It also suffered from the same \"flat grey\" effect as the \"scripted\"\
      \ square/sphere combo.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"\

      <ul>\n<li>The behaviour of the shadows changed after I had run the level for\
      \ several minutes. The \"flat grey\" issue was consistent and repeatable at\
      \ first, but disappeared and could not be reproduced after the first few minutes.\
      \ The flickering on the \"scriptedShadow\" square/sphere also declined dramatically\
      \ and no longer appeared to have any discernable pattern or relationship to\
      \ the angle of viewing.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Also, if you stand \"within\"\
      \ the spinning A in the recess, your player's shadow is projected onto the surface\
      \ of the A, farthest from where your pawn is actually at. (highly unrealistic)\
      \ Due to the way the projector is used this is probrably unavoidable. It is\
      \ a problem with the built in shadows as well. (At least, I assume that your\
      \ sourced shadows were used for the shadow in this level.</li>\n</ul>\n<div\

      <p>Unfortunately in my final touches I've discovered a fairly serious issue\
      \ I have to resolve. I still might make it tonight but it might be tomorrow\
      \ or tuesday sometime. I didn't have time to make a <i>playable</i> demo map\
      \ so the sample will just be a map showing off all the features instead.</p>\n\
      <p>Quick rundown of those features</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shadow sources replace <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Light\" title=\"Legacy:Light\">Lights</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:Spotlight\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Spotlight\">Spotlights</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/Legacy:Volume\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Volume\">Volumes</a> create areas in which actors will cast\
      \ shadows</li>\n<li>players, pickups, and projectiles all create shadows. Unfortunately\
      \ doe to some bizareness that I don't yet understand translocators do not in\
      \ this release. This may be related to the problem I've just encountered.</li>\n\
      <li>transitions into, out of, and between volumes are handled smoothly with\
      \ configurable fade times</li>\n<li>most shadow options (includeing <i>always\
      \ blob shadows</i> and <i>no tangent fade</i>) can be configured on a source-specific\
      \ basis</li>\n<li>Supports regular (bitmap) and blob shadows. blob shadows can\
      \ be colored to realisticly shadow large colored light sources.</li>\n<li>As\
      \ of this writing, adds only about 55k to the map file, plus the volumes and\
      \ extra data in the lights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for license, it's just gonna\
      \ be a \"mention it in the readme\" type deal.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ UT2003 is based on introduced dynamic drop shadows for players, but alas they're\
      \ always just falling into the same direction with no regard to the lights placed\
      \ in a map. Hence, this page strives to explain how to get true <b>Sourced Player\
      \ Shadows</b> into the game.</p>\n<p>Not all the exposed variables do anything,\
      \ and it probably still has some bugs, but at least it works:</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.inio.org/~inio/dynamicshadows.zip\"\
      >Sourced Player Shadows Beta</a></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>That includes a map thats little\
      \ demo, and source scripts. For some reason I didn't include the myLevel.u package\
      \ to make it easy to include in your own maps, but I've got a workaround for\
      \ that in a bit.</p>\n<p>If you're just in it for the tech demo, load up the\
      \ map single player no bots and type \"behindview 1\" at the console. Now walk\
      \ around and watch the shadows change to reflect the local lighting. Weeee!</p>\n\
      <p>If you're thinking of using this tech in your own map, the most important\
      \ thing to know is that each DynamicShadowVolume creates a shadow for each player\
      \ within it, source at the most important ShadowCaster (typ. ShadowLight) with\
      \ the same <a href=\"/Legacy:Tag\" title=\"Legacy:Tag\">Tag</a>. Each DynamicShadowVolume\
      \ will create only one shadow for each player within it. As a side effect if\
      \ you have multiple intersecting DynamicShadowVolumes, players within them will\
      \ have multiple shadows. ShadowCaster exists to be subclassed. I didn't create\
      \ a ShadowSpotLight yet, but it wouldn't be hard.</p>\n<p>To use this in your\
      \ own map, first load the sample map into <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd\" title=\"\
      Legacy:UnrealEd\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UnrealEd</a>, then load your map. Now\
      \ place a DynamicShadowVolume and a ShadowLight somewhere in your map. Always\
      \ make sure before saving that there is at least one DynamicShadowVolume and\
      \ one ShadowLight in the map. Loading the sample map as a script package is\
      \ not advised, as I've had very odd behavior when I've done that in the past.</p>\n\
      <p>Note that right now you do not have the right to redistribute maps containing\
      \ this code. This will be remedied in the upcoming final release.</p>\n<h2><span\

      <p><b>inio:</b> I'll tell the story of the development for the scripters when\
      \ I'm done. Right now I don't want a lot of mappers (consumers) playing around\
      \ with and judging this until I'm satisfied with it's quality. The archive that\
      \ was released was to get feedback on interest and easy of use. I've gotten\
      \ negligible feedback on the later but the resounding positive interest has\
      \ convinced me that any minor easy of use issues are easily compensated by the\
      \ general coolness of the code (product). Rather than spend time documenting\
      \ the development and doing incremental releases, I instead am concentrating\
      \ on getting a full-featured release into the hands of content creators ASAP.\
      \ When that time comes, I'd love a BU news post&#160;:).</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ Instead of having the shadows cast by predefined casters, it might be easier\
      \ to just have a mutator that places a shadow caster at the location of every\
      \ light that is over a certain intensity. Generally speaking that's where mapps\
      \ would place their shadow casters anyway.. wherever the brightest lights are.</p>\n\
      <p><b>inio:</b> First off all, there are way too many bright lights in most\
      \ maps for that to be feasible. The shadow logic has to examine every potential\
      \ caster each frame. If you get above about 100 lights that starts becoming\
      \ a non-trivial CPU hit. Splitting the map into multiple DynamicShadowVolumes\
      \ reduces this by reducing the number of potential casters the shadow casters.\
      \ Secondly, the ShadowCaster (and it's descendants ShadowLight and ShadowSpotlight)\
      \ are already a subclass of Light and so can be used to create light in the\
      \ map themseleves.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I suppose, it just seems more logical\
      \ to me that way because then it could be made to work on any map, since it\
      \ isn't really map-specific. Perhaps you could use the already existing zoning\
      \ in lieu of volumes? At any rate, it's just an idea.</p>\n<p><b>inio:</b> Are\
      \ scripted textures rendered on the gpu or on the cpu?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ I'm pretty sure that they are \"assembled\" on the CPU. The GPU does the actual\
      \ drawing on the surface, however.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> I wouldn't be so\
      \ sure about that; just look at the DrawPortal function. I rather expect the\
      \ game reserves some video memory for that texture and directly draws there\
      \ within the realm of the GPU.</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> Let me just get this\
      \ straight, you can have Volumes AND points in space that will create shadows\
      \ (so its just a simple placing these actors over top map lights)&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>inioAtWork:</b> Not quite. What you do is first define the Volumes in\
      \ which actors will cast shadows. You then replace regular lights in/near those\
      \ volumes with special shadow lights (that have all the functionality of a regular\
      \ light or spotlight). You set the Tag of the volume and the light's from which\
      \ actors in the volume will cast shadows to the same thing. It's okay to be\
      \ a little lazy with the volumes - if you keep it under about 50 shadow lights\
      \ per volume you should be just fine performance wise. If you go over that you\
      \ might see some issues caused by the code having to pick out the top few lights\
      \ to cast shadows for every frame. It'll make more sense once you see the demo\
      \ map (which will be released this weekend, along with version 1.0 of the module).</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mosquito:</b> ok, so the only thing zones do is make the light sources\
      \ function! I was worried you needed to make like light boxes or something,\
      \ and have to manually set which way the shadow casts!</p>\n<p><b>inioAtWork:</b>\
      \ <i>Mosquito:</i> Nope, the directions are automatic based on the sources.\
      \ A DynamicShadowVolume can also replace the default shadow with one that has\
      \ custom direction, distance, and darkness/color, which would be useful in outside\
      \ areas with sunlight. <i>Mychaeel:</i> Just noticed your comments. My worry\
      \ is that doing faded blob shadows will be almost as bad as if I used regular\
      \ shadows, causing a texture upload each frame (rather than just rendering a\
      \ few polygons into a texture, which in comparison is very cheap).</p>\n<p><b>MWGemini:</b>\
      \ 12/30/03: Is this still a work in progress, and will you be releasing this\
      \ code to mod teams/the public? If you are no longer supporting this project,\
      \ but would be willing to release the code as is, I (and many others, I'm sure)\
      \ would be very interested in using it.</p>\n<p><b>Dr.AwkwArD:</b> Will it also\
      \ support movers and Karma in general (since it'll support projectiles)?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Dr.AwkwArD:</b> 4/6/2004: What is the status of this project? This seems\
      \ like it's a great mapping resource, and I'm anxious to see it progress. BTW,\
      \ in case anyone is interested, I compiled and ran it in UT2004 and it seems\
      \ to work properly.&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> Back to Fox's idea, The\
      \ Mutator would only have to perform the caculations ONCE at map start, after\
      \ that the Shadow caster's would continue to exist on there own. The calculations\
      \ could limit the number of caster's so that you would'nt have more than a certain\
      \ number of shadows in any given area (which like emitters should'nt render\
      \ shadows unless they are likely to be seen) Obviously this kind of mutator\
      \ would work well on some maps and not well on others but would provide a quick\
      \ and dirty retrofit for existing maps. (The mutator could even detect whether\
      \ a map has shadow zone/volume/caster's and not do anything in that case)&#160;:D</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I think Inio's hesitance to do it that was was because of\
      \ the number of shadow casters that would be created. However, now that I think\
      \ about it, you could maintain a dynamic array of all zones in the mutator,\
      \ and that could maintain a dynamic array of shadow casters that can possibly\
      \ affect actors in that zone. That way, you can precalculate virtually all of\
      \ the checks, and completely exclude shadow casters that are too far away. The\
      \ only ones you'd have to check would be ones that may or may not be able to\
      \ make an affect.</p>\n<p><b>SquirrelZero:</b> True dynamic shadows have interested\
      \ me for quite some time. I remember reading inio's original data on this project\
      \ about a year ago and was very intrigued, now i'm getting around to completing\
      \ my own. For those who might be interested i will be releasing a public domain\
      \ version of my shadow engine, which does not require any specially placed mapper\
      \ volumes or anything like that. All light source calculations are done via\
      \ code and it is compatible with any existing maps and mods. It features multiple\
      \ shadow support, multiple lightsource calculation, dynamically adjusted shadow\
      \ FOV, full sunlight actor and even dynamic light support (this makes muzzle\
      \ flash shadows possible), dynamic shadow lightening and darkening, and will\
      \ not pass through walls as often as most shadow projectors will (still an issue,\
      \ although i'm working on improving this). Even in maps with hundreds of lights,\
      \ it still performs acceptably, as it was designed to support many players at\
      \ once. The drawbacks are that it performs a bit worse than the standard 2k4\
      \ dynamic shadows, does not support zonelight, shadows look a little odd at\
      \ certain angles sometimes (working on this), it doesn't always support every\
      \ type of dynamic light (actors that are not light subclasses and are not spawned\
      \ with lighting properties but later given them) and will not work on linux\
      \ or mac. Although i wrote this about 5 months ago, it wasn't viable due to\
      \ the fact that the shadows often projected onto the owner pawn, but with the\
      \ addition of the bNoProjectOwner variable in UT2004 i decided to revisit it&#160;:)</p>\n\

    text: "===TEST MAP FOR BUGS===\n\nI put together a map to try to track down the\
      \ cause of the bugs that have shown up.  [http://www.ataricommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=310692\
      \ Read about it here, and try it if you have a second].\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I didn't\
      \ really follow that checklist you made but I tested lots of stuff anyway..\
      \ I'm not quite sure the exact terminology because I haven't experimented with\
      \ the classes, I just downloaded the demo map to see if I could help you find\
      \ the bugs. :P Anyways, here were my observations: (I supercompressed the JPEGs,\
      \ so the image quality is very poor, but it should still be enough to illustrate\
      \ the bug.)\n* The area with the three squares on the wall with the A shadows\
      \ spinning around, the Scripted Shadow/Static Mesh and Scripted Shadow/BSP flickered\
      \ at some angles. There was a discernable pattern in the flickering, which varies\
      \ based on the angle. The Shadow Bitmap square did not flicker.\n* Switching\
      \ tasks while playing causes the shadows to be garbled upon switching back.\
      \ This rectifies itself in the next tick. This affects both the wall shadows\
      \ and player shadows.\n* The square/sphere combo shadowbitmap and plain appeared\
      \ fine, though the shadowbitmap one exhibited the task switching glitch detailed\
      \ above.\n* The \"scripted\" square/sphere combo did not experience this glitch,\
      \ but would go nearly completely flat grey right when I got to the point that\
      \ the shadow started to be projected on my pawn. The shadow was projected on\
      \ the pawn properly when this occurred, however.\n* The \"scriptedShadow\" square/sphere\
      \ combo flickered madly, though with a discernable pattern. At first this appeared\
      \ independant of the angle. It also suffered from the same \"flat grey\" effect\
      \ as the \"scripted\" square/sphere combo.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Sourced_Player_Shadows_Bug_1.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \n'''Note, however:'''\n* The behaviour of the shadows changed after I had run\
      \ the level for several minutes. The \"flat grey\" issue was consistent and\
      \ repeatable at first, but disappeared and could not be reproduced after the\
      \ first few minutes. The flickering on the \"scriptedShadow\" square/sphere\
      \ also declined dramatically and no longer appeared to have any discernable\
      \ pattern or relationship to the angle of viewing.\n\n* Also, if you stand \"\
      within\" the spinning A in the recess, your player's shadow is projected onto\
      \ the surface of the A, farthest from where your pawn is actually at. (highly\
      \ unrealistic) Due to the way the projector is used this is probrably unavoidable.\
      \ It is a problem with the built in shadows as well. (At least, I assume that\
      \ your sourced shadows were used for the shadow in this level.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Sourced_Player_Shadows_Bug_2.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \n'''inio:''' Thanks!  What graphics hardware do you have?  As for the shadow\
      \ bug you mentioned, thats the default shadow.  This map doesn't have the sourced\
      \ shadow stuff (just to remove any unnecessary variables).\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ I don't remember when the last time was that I opened it, so I'll just go\
      \ by the sticker on the side of the case. It just says Integrated nVidia GeForce\
      \ 2 with 32MB Video RAM. It's on a Compaq 6020 CA, though I would assume that\
      \ the integrated processor is the same as an AGP version of the same card, so\
      \ that might not be relevant.\n\n'''inio:''' Ah, I was wondering if it affected\
      \ NVidia setups too.  So this appears to be either a bug in D3D or UT, rather\
      \ than in the ATI drivers.\n\n===Update===\n\nFor anyone still listening, Epic\
      \ has indicated the all render-to-texture is not really supported in the OpenGL\
      \ and software renderers, so I'm going to make a few more attempts but if those\
      \ don't work I'm giving up and I'm going to restrict anything not using the\
      \ D3D renderer to grayscale shadows or a single blob shadow.  I have some ideas\
      \ for making the single blob shadow as useful as possible.\n\n===OLDER===\n\n\
      Unfortunately in my final touches I've discovered a fairly serious issue I have\
      \ to resolve.  I still might make it tonight but it might be tomorrow or tuesday\
      \ sometime.  I didn't have time to make a ''playable'' demo map so the sample\
      \ will just be a map showing off all the features instead.\n\nQuick rundown\
      \ of those features\n* Shadow sources replace [[Legacy:Light|Light]]s and [[Legacy:Spotlight|Spotlight]]s\n\
      * [[Legacy:Volume|Volume]]s create areas in which actors will cast shadows\n\
      * players, pickups, and projectiles all create shadows.  Unfortunately doe to\
      \ some bizareness that I don't yet understand translocators do not in this release.\
      \  This may be related to the problem I've just encountered.\n* transitions\
      \ into, out of, and between volumes are handled smoothly with configurable fade\
      \ times\n* most shadow options (includeing ''always blob shadows'' and ''no\
      \ tangent fade'') can be configured on a source-specific basis\n* Supports regular\
      \ (bitmap) and blob shadows.  blob shadows can be colored to realisticly shadow\
      \ large colored light sources.\n* As of this writing, adds only about 55k to\
      \ the map file, plus the volumes and extra data in the lights.\n\nAs for license,\
      \ it's just gonna be a \"mention it in the readme\" type deal.\n\n----\n\n===MUCH\
      \ older===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_sourced_player_shadows_1.jpeg|right|Early screenshots\
      \ in a test map.]]\n\nThe Unreal-engine generation UT2003 is based on introduced\
      \ dynamic drop shadows for players, but alas they're always just falling into\
      \ the same direction with no regard to the lights placed in a map.  Hence, this\
      \ page strives to explain how to get true '''Sourced Player Shadows''' into\
      \ the game.\n\nNot all the exposed variables do anything, and it probably still\
      \ has some bugs, but at least it works:\n\n: [http://www.inio.org/~inio/dynamicshadows.zip\
      \ Sourced Player Shadows Beta]\n\nThat includes a map thats little demo, and\
      \ source scripts. For some reason I didn't include the myLevel.u package to\
      \ make it easy to include in your own maps, but I've got a workaround for that\
      \ in a bit.\n\nIf you're just in it for the tech demo, load up the map single\
      \ player no bots and type \"behindview 1\" at the console. Now walk around and\
      \ watch the shadows change to reflect the local lighting. Weeee!\n\nIf you're\
      \ thinking of using this tech in your own map, the most important thing to know\
      \ is that each DynamicShadowVolume creates a shadow for each player within it,\
      \ source at the most important ShadowCaster (typ. ShadowLight) with the same\
      \ [[Legacy:Tag|Tag]]. Each DynamicShadowVolume will create only one shadow for\
      \ each player within it. As a side effect if you have multiple intersecting\
      \ DynamicShadowVolumes, players within them will have multiple shadows. ShadowCaster\
      \ exists to be subclassed. I didn't create a ShadowSpotLight yet, but it wouldn't\
      \ be hard.\n\nTo use this in your own map, first load the sample map into [[Legacy:UnrealEd|UnrealEd]],\
      \ then load your map. Now place a DynamicShadowVolume and a ShadowLight somewhere\
      \ in your map. Always make sure before saving that there is at least one DynamicShadowVolume\
      \ and one ShadowLight in the map. Loading the sample map as a script package\
      \ is not advised, as I've had very odd behavior when I've done that in the past.\n\
      \nNote that right now you do not have the right to redistribute maps containing\
      \ this code.  This will be remedied in the upcoming final release.\n\n==Features:==\n\
      * Should be pretty easy for mappers to pick up and use.\n* Shadows fade out\
      \ after leaving a zone.\n* (unreleased) Mapper can control shadow casting distance,\
      \ whether shadows should fade as they approach parallel with the surface, and\
      \ whether to draw the shadow using blob shadow mode.\n* (unreleased) A single\
      \ DynamicShadowVolume can create multiple shadows from players.\n* (unreleased)\
      \ Shadows for pickups and projectiles.  Player, Projectile, and Pickup shadows\
      \ each have their own configuration for max # and type (rendered or blob). \
      \ Plus, you can get away with more pickup shadows because they don't have to\
      \ be detached and reattached each frame (as long as the light source isn't moving).\n\
      \n==Ideas:==\n* colored shadows for colored lights. (quite possible, just need\
      \ to merge the testing code into the rest of it)\n* blurry shadows for non-point\
      \ light sources. Could be done by drawing the shadow texture to a couple different\
      \ locations in a scripted texture with the right blend setup.\n* shadows for\
      \ particles. (maybe to a limited extent for rocket/grenade contrails only)\n\
      * Add shadows for first-person. This would be harder from what I can tell, and\
      \ would cause the odd effect of shadows from your nonexistent legs when you\
      \ look down.\n* figure out a nice way of attaching a Light to a mover, as the\
      \ code right now doesn't care if it's the light or the player that's moving.\n\
      * to reduce load in situations where you have 2 or more shadow sources close\
      \ together to create shadows appropriate for a non-point light: share the shadow\
      \ texture between them so it only gets rendered once.\n\n==Resolved Issues (but\
      \ not fixed in release code):==\n* Shadows pop up when you enter a DynamicShadowVolume\
      \ that has a light to close to it's edge. Same thing for the default shadow\
      \ disappearing and reappearing when you enter and exit DynamicShadowVolumes\
      \ (not visible in the sample map).\n* Blob shadows don't fade\n\n==Known Issues:==\n\
      * If a player gets too close to a light the shadow doesn't behave quite right.\
      \ This is due to a limit on the [[Legacy:Projector|projector]] FOV. Without\
      \ this there would be potential for enormous cpu load when an actor got too\
      \ close to a light and the FOV of the shadow projector aproached 180, resulting\
      \ in a slice of the level between the plane of the shadow projector and the\
      \ plane at the trace distance being considered for shadow casting. Right now\
      \ the FOV is limited to about 100 (not sure of the exact number).\n* Right now\
      \ there's still a few default values that need to be set to make mappers' lives\
      \ easier.\n* (untested but I assume this is the case) If a player is occluded\
      \ and therefore not drawn, their shadows will also not be drawn. While it would\
      \ be really cool to use a ground light shining up at a wall to give a hint of\
      \ player's locations without directly showing them, this could be a PITA to\
      \ get working reliably.\n\n==Questions==\n* This shouldn't add any bandwidth\
      \ overhead in net games as it happens entirely on the client side, but I'd like\
      \ someone with more experience with [[Legacy:Replication|replication]] to validate\
      \ that.\n\n----\n\n'''Mosquito:''' Just copy and pasted your post on the forums\
      \ for people twice as ass lazy as me!\n\n'''inio:''' You could have at least\
      \ wikified it a bit.  Or even just maintained the formatting that was there.\n\
      \n'''Mosquito:''' SILENCE INFIDEL!!!\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Do you want a news posting\
      \ on this? Put a link & summary on [[Legacy:Featured Pages|Featured pages]]\
      \ if you do.\n\n'''inio:''' Not yet.  This is not final by a long shot and doesn't\
      \ even contain a license allow redistribution.  I'll be done with it this weekend\
      \ some time and have the release party then :).  Why do you insist on changing\
      \ my 2nd level headings to 1st level heading?  I like the way 2nd level headings\
      \ look.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Nobody said you should ''release'' it.  :-)  I suppose\
      \ tarquin rather thought about pointing people to it as the work in progress\
      \ it is; that's far more interesting than just a finished component anyway.\n\
      \nAs for the headings:  You don't format visually here; you format logically.\
      \  First-level headings are for first-level structure; so there.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Yeah, I just thought it would make a good news post. People get to see what\
      \ you're working on. Good publicity for the wiki as a whole too :D &ndash; could\
      \ probably get us a BU news post.\n\n'''inio:''' I'll tell the story of the\
      \ development for the scripters when I'm done.  Right now I don't want a lot\
      \ of mappers (consumers) playing around with and judging this until I'm satisfied\
      \ with it's quality.  The archive that was released was to get feedback on interest\
      \ and easy of use.  I've gotten negligible feedback on the later but the resounding\
      \ positive interest has convinced me that any minor easy of use issues are easily\
      \ compensated by the general coolness of the code (product).  Rather than spend\
      \ time documenting the development and doing incremental releases, I instead\
      \ am concentrating on getting a full-featured release into the hands of content\
      \ creators ASAP.  When that time comes, I'd love a BU news post :).\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ Instead of having the shadows cast by predefined casters, it might be easier\
      \ to just have a mutator that places a shadow caster at the location of every\
      \ light that is over a certain intensity. Generally speaking that's where mapps\
      \ would place their shadow casters anyway.. wherever the brightest lights are.\n\
      \n'''inio:''' First off all, there are way too many bright lights in most maps\
      \ for that to be feasible.  The shadow logic has to examine every potential\
      \ caster each frame.  If you get above about 100 lights that starts becoming\
      \ a non-trivial CPU hit.  Splitting the map into multiple DynamicShadowVolumes\
      \ reduces this by reducing the number of potential casters the shadow casters.\
      \  Secondly, the ShadowCaster (and it's descendants ShadowLight and ShadowSpotlight)\
      \ are already a subclass of Light and so can be used to create light in the\
      \ map themseleves.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I suppose, it just seems more logical to\
      \ me that way because then it could be made to work on any map, since it isn't\
      \ really map-specific. Perhaps you could use the already existing zoning in\
      \ lieu of volumes? At any rate, it's just an idea.\n\n'''inio:''' Are scripted\
      \ textures rendered on the gpu or on the cpu?\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I'm pretty sure\
      \ that they are \"assembled\" on the CPU. The GPU does the actual drawing on\
      \ the surface, however.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I wouldn't be so sure about that;\
      \ just look at the DrawPortal function.  I rather expect the game reserves some\
      \ video memory for that texture and directly draws there within the realm of\
      \ the GPU.\n\n'''Mosquito:''' Let me just get this straight, you can have Volumes\
      \ AND points in space that will create shadows (so its just a simple placing\
      \ these actors over top map lights) :)\n\n'''inioAtWork:''' Not quite.  What\
      \ you do is first define the Volumes in which actors will cast shadows.  You\
      \ then replace regular lights in/near those volumes with special shadow lights\
      \ (that have all the functionality of a regular light or spotlight).  You set\
      \ the Tag of the volume and the light's from which actors in the volume will\
      \ cast shadows to the same thing.  It's okay to be a little lazy with the volumes\
      \ - if you keep it under about 50 shadow lights per volume you should be just\
      \ fine performance wise.  If you go over that you might see some issues caused\
      \ by the code having to pick out the top few lights to cast shadows for every\
      \ frame.  It'll make more sense once you see the demo map (which will be released\
      \ this weekend, along with version 1.0 of the module).\n\n'''Mosquito:''' ok,\
      \ so the only thing zones do is make the light sources function! I was worried\
      \ you needed to make like light boxes or something, and have to manually set\
      \ which way the shadow casts!\n\n'''inioAtWork:''' ''Mosquito:'' Nope, the directions\
      \ are automatic based on the sources.  A DynamicShadowVolume can also replace\
      \ the default shadow with one that has custom direction, distance, and darkness/color,\
      \ which would be useful in outside areas with sunlight.  ''Mychaeel:'' Just\
      \ noticed your comments.  My worry is that doing faded blob shadows will be\
      \ almost as bad as if I used regular shadows, causing a texture upload each\
      \ frame (rather than just rendering a few polygons into a texture, which in\
      \ comparison is very cheap).\n\n'''MWGemini:''' 12/30/03: Is this still a work\
      \ in progress, and will you be releasing this code to mod teams/the public?\
      \ If you are no longer supporting this project, but would be willing to release\
      \ the code as is, I (and many others, I'm sure) would be very interested in\
      \ using it.\n\n'''Dr.AwkwArD:''' Will it also support movers and Karma in general\
      \ (since it'll support projectiles)?\n\n'''Dr.AwkwArD:''' 4/6/2004:  What is\
      \ the status of this project?  This seems like it's a great mapping resource,\
      \ and I'm anxious to see it progress.  BTW, in case anyone is interested, I\
      \ compiled and ran it in UT2004 and it seems to work properly. :D\n\n'''Dirk\
      \ Fist:''' Back to Fox's idea, The Mutator would only have to perform the caculations\
      \ ONCE at map start, after that the Shadow caster's would continue to exist\
      \ on there own. The calculations could limit the number of caster's so that\
      \ you would'nt have more than a certain number of shadows in any given area\
      \ (which like emitters should'nt render shadows unless they are likely to be\
      \ seen) Obviously this kind of mutator would work well on some maps and not\
      \ well on others but would provide a quick and dirty retrofit for existing maps.\
      \ (The mutator could even detect whether a map has shadow zone/volume/caster's\
      \ and not do anything in that case) :D\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I think Inio's hesitance\
      \ to do it that was was because of the number of shadow casters that would be\
      \ created. However, now that I think about it, you could maintain a dynamic\
      \ array of all zones in the mutator, and that could maintain a dynamic array\
      \ of shadow casters that can possibly affect actors in that zone. That way,\
      \ you can precalculate virtually all of the checks, and completely exclude shadow\
      \ casters that are too far away. The only ones you'd have to check would be\
      \ ones that may or may not be able to make an affect.\n\n'''SquirrelZero:'''\
      \ True dynamic shadows have interested me for quite some time.  I remember reading\
      \ inio's original data on this project about a year ago and was very intrigued,\
      \ now i'm getting around to completing my own.  For those who might be interested\
      \ i will be releasing a public domain version of my shadow engine, which does\
      \ not require any specially placed mapper volumes or anything like that.  All\
      \ light source calculations are done via code and it is compatible with any\
      \ existing maps and mods.  It features multiple shadow support, multiple lightsource\
      \ calculation, dynamically adjusted shadow FOV, full sunlight actor and even\
      \ dynamic light support (this makes muzzle flash shadows possible), dynamic\
      \ shadow lightening and darkening, and will not pass through walls as often\
      \ as most shadow projectors will (still an issue, although i'm working on improving\
      \ this).  Even in maps with hundreds of lights, it still performs acceptably,\
      \ as it was designed to support many players at once.  The drawbacks are that\
      \ it performs a bit worse than the standard 2k4 dynamic shadows, does not support\
      \ zonelight, shadows look a little odd at certain angles sometimes (working\
      \ on this), it doesn't always support every type of dynamic light (actors that\
      \ are not light subclasses and are not spawned with lighting properties but\
      \ later given them) and will not work on linux or mac.  Although i wrote this\
      \ about 5 months ago, it wasn't viable due to the fact that the shadows often\
      \ projected onto the owner pawn, but with the addition of the bNoProjectOwner\
      \ variable in UT2004 i decided to revisit it :)\n\n'''JCBDigger:''' worth linking\
