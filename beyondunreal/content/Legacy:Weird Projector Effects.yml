      \ command removes the “press fire to enter” message. Then position yourself\
      \ and press F9. This command stores a screenshot in you Ut2003/system directory.\
      \ You will then need to open the image in an image editing program I suggest\
      \ photoshop or paint shop pro. Then change the image size to 512*512 and save\
      \ as a bitmap. Here is the image I used:</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"\
      floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_ProjectorTrick1.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img\
      \ alt=\"Legacy ProjectorTrick1.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_ProjectorTrick1.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"512\" height=\"512\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>Then open up your level,\
      \ place a projector over the teleport and set all its projecting properties\
      \ to false except for actors and particles. Set the projector’s texture to the\
      \ picture you just took (you’ll have to import it first). Then add a sprite\
      \ emitter exactly where the teleport is, set it to produce 1 particle exactly\
      \ where it was and for its life to be 8, its fade in to end on 4 and its fade\
      \ out to start on 4 and end on 8. Then in the render properties select bacceptsprojectors\
      \ and change it to true. Choose a smoke texture for the emitter, rebuild and\
      \ save. Then test your map. You should be finished, and you should see something\
      \ like this:</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"\
      /File:Legacy_projectortrick2.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy projectortrick2.jpeg\"\
      \ src=\"/w/images/Legacy_projectortrick2.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"\
      \ /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>You can add more to the effect by adding an emitter\
      \ that generates floating coronas and you can increase the brightness of the\
      \ projector in its properties.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage:\
