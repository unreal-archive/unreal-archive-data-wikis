      \ obviousbly linear layout (straight from RedFlagBase to BlueFlagBase) is very\
      \ easy to make when you have a gametype with only two game objectives and the\
      \ long range/fast movement of vehicles. Try to spread out (branch out) the routes\
      \ between flags; spreading the field out and offering more variety in routes\
      \ to and from the enemy flag. Otherwise, an obvious bottleneck or 'choke spot'\
      \ will present itself, making flag capture difficult if not impossible; but\
      \ definately frustrating to play, due to lack of variety.</p>\n<p>That said,\
      \ vehicles almost demand layouts of considerable size. Pedestrians should feel\
      \ somewhat \"stranded\" in remote places in your map without a vehicle. (See\
      \ ITEM PLACEMENT for pedestrian remedies)</p>\n<p>Vehicles also add firepower\
      \ and armor to each Team. Therefore, the route to the flag should be appropriately\
      \ difficult. Defenses of all kinds are encouraged to help make the Capture challenging.\
      \ (walls, doors, gates, turrets, custom shields, etc.)</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      <p>Neutral vehicles placed in the center can add to gameplay by providing a\
      \ \"soft\" gameObjective; a place Teams want to control. Neutral (non-flying)\
      \ vehicles placed near flagbases allow enemies to make quick getaways.</p>\n\
      <p>With large layouts, pedestrians can feel stranded out in remote locations.\

      \ ones for Red and Blue teams. These must be accessible to a RoadPathNode path\

      \ (set <tt>PlayerStart.TeamNum</tt>s: 0=red, 1=blue)</li>\n<li>Place an <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:AssaultPath\" title=\"Legacy:AssaultPath\">AssaultPath</a> near each\
      \ flag (line of sight is good) for the attacking team.</li>\n<li>Place VehicleFactory\
      \ actors where you want vehicles to spawn. Set the direction you want them to\
      \ start in. The TeamNumber for the vehicles will be set automatically when using\
      \ ONSVehicleFactories; whichever gameobjective is closer; the red flag or the\
      \ blue flag. By using custom actors like the <a href=\"/Legacy:TeamVehicleFactory\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:TeamVehicleFactory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">TeamVehicleFactory</a>,\
      \ you can set the TeamNumber yourself. (0=red, 1=blue, 255=none or neutral)</li>\n\
      <li>When placing <a href=\"/Legacy:RoadPathNode\" title=\"Legacy:RoadPathNode\"\
      >RoadPathNodes</a>, keep the paths wide (white) between nodes for large ground\
      \ vehicles and especially along the paths to the flags. Keep these spaced over\
      \ 512 or 1024 apart because vehicles are not as agile as players on foot; they\
      \ need to make wider turns. Try to keep the number of pathnodes even on each\
      \ team's side of the map. There must be at least one white path connecting the\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A few key points\
      \ to note in the construction of a VCTF level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using an <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:AssaultPath\" title=\"Legacy:AssaultPath\">AssaultPath</a> after the\
      \ last <a href=\"/Legacy:RoadPathNode\" title=\"Legacy:RoadPathNode\">RoadPathNode</a>\
      \ that vehicles can reach works, and works well, but introduces new and even\
      \ more complex issues into the equation. Someone else mentioned it in another\
      \ thread, but what good is it to have your bot grab the flag and then not have\
      \ a vehicle available when it returns to the RoadPathed area of the map? The\
      \ best bet is to have the flag in an area where it can make a double (bi-directional)\
      \ white connection to one or more RoadPathNodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Think\
      \ vertical and you can have your cake and eat it too. I have created a second\
      \ elevated level that is pathed just for foot use and it also connects to both\
      \ flags and, even though the bots use it, it does not preclude them from using\
      \ the vehicles as well. In fact, combos are very possible as I have seen them\
      \ use the overhead route to get the flag and then jump into a Tank or a Hell\
      \ Bender that one of their team-mates is using and hitch a ride home...</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The translocator definitely should be allowed in the game-type.\
      \ The bots commonly chase a team-mate's vehicle with it and will jump on-board\
      \ in mid-toss...It is extremely cool to watch them do this... (<b>SuperApe</b>:\
      \ Toonce's is talking about ignoring the default rules for VCTF that disallow\
      \ Translocators. This could be done by placing a custom actor (subclass of <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:XPickUpBase\" title=\"Legacy:XPickUpBase\">xPickUpBase</a>)\
      \ and specifying a XWeapon.Transpickup as it's Powerup. See also <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24029\"\
      >this thread</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>When the flag is in a vehicle accessible\
      \ area, elevate it above the floor on some type of base that the bots can climb\
      \ on foot, but not in a vehicle. I am using an octagonal base that is about\
      \ 256 units in diameter and about 40 units high. It has 4 narrow stairwells\
      \ cut into it (one on every other side) that the bots can use. It is high enough\
      \ to stop a vehicle (except for the Leviathan), but not so high that the nearby\
      \ RoadPathNodes cannot make a good path connection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why do you\
      \ need this? Because the bots playing defense will pile into a Goliath and camp\
      \ the flag if they can get on top of it...and I mean literally ON TOP of it.\
      \ An enemy bot cannot get to it to take the flag if they are there. This is\
      \ a workaround of sorts, but it is an effective one as even if they are using\
      \ a Tank, if the attacker engages them, another bot can come up form behind\
      \ and take the flag...I've watched it a dozen times.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As I said\
      \ above, the 40 unit high barrier will not stop a Leviathan...Hence, tip #5\
      \ is do not path the Leviathans if you have them in your level. If a Masterful\
      \ bot gets into one of them with a couple of his pals, the other team is in\
      \ big trouble. It's better to keep them out the Leviathans unless a human is\
      \ driving it. (<b>GreatEmerald</b>: If you need a Leviathan, though, you can\
      \ set some RoadPathNodes' properties, under Navigation Point, bNoSuperSize to\
      \ True to keep Leviathans out of some trouble. This way you can also make a\
      \ defensive Leviathan by setting bNoSuperSize properties only to those nodes\
      \ that are close to flags, although bots might not want to go in. You might\
      \ also path everything normally, add an AssaultPath somewhat away from the flag\
      \ and make all next PathNodes/RoadPathNodes bNoSuperSize to make bots use Leviathans,\
      \ but not spam with them.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>RoadPathNodes can be further\
      \ cleaned up by changing the MaxRoadDistance value in the properties. The default\
      \ distance is ten thousand. This can create ALL KINDS of unwanted clutter. In\
      \ the top orthographic view measure between the nodes that you want to connect\
      \ using SHIFT+MIDDLEMOUSE to bring up the ruler and adjust the nodes accordingly.</li>\n\

      \ Saw some interesting bot behaviour when spectating a VCTF match with 2 bots.\
      \ I used AssaultPaths. So when a bot with a vehicle got to one, it left the\
      \ vehicle, took the flag and... Acted randomly. Usually, bots enter the vehicle\
      \ with which they came, then instantly exit. Some times though, they enter the\
      \ vehicle, drive in it for a few seconds and leave it. And the other times bots\
      \ enter the vehicle and drive nicely. When the bots get back on foot, they can\
      \ use their own vehicles near their base. Strangely, bots with flags enter the\
      \ vehicle, and again, some times they drive, and some times they just leave\
      \ the vehicle. Another strange addition is when a bot with a flag tries to return\
      \ their own flag. One time a bot in a tank killed a bot flag carrier, then drove\
      \ very near the dropped flag, returned it, then continued on foot, decided to\
      \ get into the tank again, ran back and stood near the vehicle, but didn't enter.\
      \ Another bot that was carrying the flag on foot killed another flag carrier\
      \ (it was on foot too), ran away from its own flag, decided to return it, returned\
      \ it, ran back to the AssaultPath and again tried to capture the enemy flag.\

    text: "'''Vehicle Capture the Flag (VCTF):''' Two teams both have a movable flag\
      \ that's planted on an immobile flag base. A team scores a point by getting\
      \ both flags to their home flag base.  This is an extention of the Capture the\
      \ Flag gametype for [[Legacy:UT2004|UT2004]] with the primary difference being\
      \ vehicle support.  Flying Vehicles may not carry the flag and translocator\
      \ use is prohibited by default.  ''It's strongly recommended that mappers review\
      \ [[Legacy:Mapping For CTF|Mapping for CTF]] as well.''\n\n==Design considerations==\n\
      \n===Layout===\n\nAn obviousbly linear layout (straight from RedFlagBase to\
      \ BlueFlagBase) is very easy to make when you have a gametype with only two\
      \ game objectives and the long range/fast movement of vehicles.  Try to spread\
      \ out (branch out) the routes between flags; spreading the field out and offering\
      \ more variety in routes to and from the enemy flag.  Otherwise, an obvious\
      \ bottleneck or 'choke spot' will present itself, making flag capture difficult\
      \ if not impossible; but definately frustrating to play, due to lack of variety.\n\
      \nThat said, vehicles almost demand layouts of considerable size.  Pedestrians\
      \ should feel somewhat \"stranded\" in remote places in your map without a vehicle.\
      \ (See ITEM PLACEMENT for pedestrian remedies)\n\nVehicles also add firepower\
      \ and armor to each Team.  Therefore, the route to the flag should be appropriately\
      \ difficult.  Defenses of all kinds are encouraged to help make the Capture\
      \ challenging. (walls, doors, gates, turrets, custom shields, etc.)\n\n===Item\
      \ Placement===\n\nThe flagbases should be inaccessible by larger vehicles, either\
      \ by structure, barrier or pedestal.  Otherwise, players and bots will ride\
      \ a tank or leviathan on top of their flag to defend and camp on it.\n\nNeutral\
      \ vehicles placed in the center can add to gameplay by providing a \"soft\"\
      \ gameObjective; a place Teams want to control.  Neutral (non-flying) vehicles\
      \ placed near flagbases allow enemies to make quick getaways.\n\nWith large\
      \ layouts, pedestrians can feel stranded out in remote locations.  Offer them\
      \ alternative travel to key points with JumpPads, Teleporters, Movers, etc.\
      \ in those locations.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\nRemember: By default, flying vehicles\
      \ cannot carry the flag.  Also, someone riding on top of any vehicle can pick\
      \ up the flag without getting off the vehicle (the Manta is excellent for this).\n\
      \nVehicleFactories will not spawn vehicles in a VCTF map until the gametype\
      \ is set in LevelInfo to <tt>xGame.XVehicleCTFGame</tt> and both FlagBases are\
      \ placed.\n\nONSVehicles(Factories) will spawn by automatically setting the\
      \ TeamNumber to match that of the nearest GameObjective (Flag).  Try the custom\
      \ [[Legacy:TeamVehicleFactory|TeamVehicleFactory]] for greater control over\
      \ aspects of vehicle spawning.\n\n===Botplay===\n\nBots will not use vehicles\
      \ until a proper CTF bot path network is set, with an AssaultPath set to each\
      \ flag and at least one WHITE (widest) path connects the two flags.  The vehicle\
      \ spawn points must also be accessible to these wide pathways with their own\
      \ WHITE paths.\n\nNeutral controllers, controlling bots, turrets, etc., will\
      \ attack Red and Blue Team members equally.  They will ignore other Neutral\
      \ controllers, as if Neutral was it's own Team. (Team 255)\n\n==Creating a VCTF\
      \ Map ==\n\nThis is a list of critical elements needed to create a simple VCTF\
      \ map.\n* Modify LevelProperties->LevelInfo->DefaultGametype to <tt>xGame.xVehicleCTFGame</tt>.\n\
      * A big enough space for vehicles and/or flying vehicles.\n* Place two [[Legacy:XRealCTFBase|xRealCTFBase]]s,\
      \ ones for Red and Blue teams.  These must be accessible to a RoadPathNode path\
      \ network. (see the '''Botplay''' section above)\n* Place player starts (set\
      \ <tt>PlayerStart.TeamNum</tt>s: 0=red, 1=blue)\n* Place an [[Legacy:AssaultPath|AssaultPath]]\
      \ near each flag (line of sight is good) for the attacking team.\n* Place VehicleFactory\
      \ actors where you want vehicles to spawn. Set the direction you want them to\
      \ start in. The TeamNumber for the vehicles will be set automatically when using\
      \ ONSVehicleFactories; whichever gameobjective is closer; the red flag or the\
      \ blue flag. By using custom actors like the [[Legacy:TeamVehicleFactory|TeamVehicleFactory]],\
      \ you can set the TeamNumber yourself. (0=red, 1=blue, 255=none or neutral)\n\
      * When placing [[Legacy:RoadPathNode|RoadPathNode]]s, keep the paths wide (white)\
      \ between nodes for large ground vehicles and especially along the paths to\
      \ the flags. Keep these spaced over 512 or 1024 apart because vehicles are not\
      \ as agile as players on foot; they need to make wider turns.  Try to keep the\
      \ number of pathnodes even on each team's side of the map.  There must be at\
      \ least one white path connecting the flags to the path network, but more paths\
      \ are recommended.\n* Place [[Legacy:FlyingPathNode|FlyingPathNode]]s (between\
      \ 1024 and 2048 apart) about 1024 to 2048 above the ground. Don't bother making\
      \ fine or complicated pathing for flying vehicles, with momentum carrying them,\
      \ they need to make very wide turns, rises and dives.\n\n==Tips==\n\n===Vehicle\
      \ Pathing for VCTF ( by Toonces T. Cat )===\n\nA few key points to note in the\
      \ construction of a VCTF level.\n\n* Using an [[Legacy:AssaultPath|AssaultPath]]\
      \ after the last [[Legacy:RoadPathNode|RoadPathNode]] that vehicles can reach\
      \ works, and works well, but introduces new and even more complex issues into\
      \ the equation. Someone else mentioned it in another thread, but what good is\
      \ it to have your bot grab the flag and then not have a vehicle available when\
      \ it returns to the RoadPathed area of the map? The best bet is to have the\
      \ flag in an area where it can make a double (bi-directional) white connection\
      \ to one or more RoadPathNodes.\n\n* Think vertical and you can have your cake\
      \ and eat it too. I have created a second elevated level that is pathed just\
      \ for foot use and it also connects to both flags and, even though the bots\
      \ use it, it does not preclude them from using the vehicles as well. In fact,\
      \ combos are very possible as I have seen them use the overhead route to get\
      \ the flag and then jump into a Tank or a Hell Bender that one of their team-mates\
      \ is using and hitch a ride home...\n\n* The translocator definitely should\
      \ be allowed in the game-type. The bots commonly chase a team-mate's vehicle\
      \ with it and will jump on-board in mid-toss...It is extremely cool to watch\
      \ them do this... ('''SuperApe''': Toonce's is talking about ignoring the default\
      \ rules for VCTF that disallow Translocators.  This could be done by placing\
      \ a custom actor (subclass of [[Legacy:XPickUpBase|xPickUpBase]]) and specifying\
      \ a XWeapon.Transpickup as it's Powerup.  See also [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24029\
      \ this thread].)\n\n* When the flag is in a vehicle accessible area, elevate\
      \ it above the floor on some type of base that the bots can climb on foot, but\
      \ not in a vehicle. I am using an octagonal base that is about 256 units in\
      \ diameter and about 40 units high. It has 4 narrow stairwells cut into it (one\
      \ on every other side) that the bots can use. It is high enough to stop a vehicle\
      \ (except for the Leviathan), but not so high that the nearby RoadPathNodes\
      \ cannot make a good path connection.\n\nWhy do you need this? Because the bots\
      \ playing defense will pile into a Goliath and camp the flag if they can get\
      \ on top of it...and I mean literally ON TOP of it. An enemy bot cannot get\
      \ to it to take the flag if they are there. This is a workaround of sorts, but\
      \ it is an effective one as even if they are using a Tank, if the attacker engages\
      \ them, another bot can come up form behind and take the flag...I've watched\
      \ it a dozen times.\n\n* As I said above, the 40 unit high barrier will not\
      \ stop a Leviathan...Hence, tip #5 is do not path the Leviathans if you have\
      \ them in your level. If a Masterful bot gets into one of them with a couple\
      \ of his pals, the other team is in big trouble. It's better to keep them out\
      \ the Leviathans unless a human is driving it. ('''GreatEmerald''': If you need\
      \ a Leviathan, though, you can set some RoadPathNodes' properties, under Navigation\
      \ Point, bNoSuperSize to True to keep Leviathans out of some trouble. This way\
      \ you can also make a defensive Leviathan by setting bNoSuperSize properties\
      \ only to those nodes that are close to flags, although bots might not want\
      \ to go in. You might also path everything normally, add an AssaultPath somewhat\
      \ away from the flag and make all next PathNodes/RoadPathNodes bNoSuperSize\
      \ to make bots use Leviathans, but not spam with them.)\n\n* RoadPathNodes can\
      \ be further cleaned up by changing the MaxRoadDistance value in the properties.\
      \ The default distance is ten thousand. This can create ALL KINDS of unwanted\
      \ clutter. In the top orthographic view measure between the nodes that you want\
      \ to connect using  SHIFT+MIDDLEMOUSE to bring up the ruler and adjust the nodes\
      \ accordingly.\n\n==FAQ==\n\nFrequently asked questions and common problems\
      \ while mapping for VCTF.\n\n* ''Where is the VehicleCTF gametype in the UT2004\
      \ menu?''\n\nThe VehicleCTF gametype will not show up in the list of available\
      \ gametypes until at least one VCTF map is placed in the Maps directory. (Filename\
      \ syntax is : '''VCTF-Foo''')\n* ''Vehicles aren't spawning''\n\nYou must modify\
      \ LevelProperties->LevelInfo->DefaultGametype to <tt>xGame.xVehicleCTFGame</tt>\
      \ and have both the Red and Blue team FlagBases set in the map.  After that,\
      \ Vehicle Factories will spawn vehicles.\n* ''Bots won't use the vehicles''\n\
      \nThere must be at least one fully connected path from one flag to the other\
      \ and at least one of these paths must be solidly '''white''' all along the\
      \ route.  This will indicate to bots that they can use a vehicle to reach their\
      \ goal along that path.  The VehicleFactories will also have to be connected\
      \ to at least one of these routes with a white path.\n* ''Bots only use the\
      \ shortest path to the enemy flag and back''\n\nUse of an AssaultPath close\
      \ to and within line of sight of the target flag will help bots reach their\
      \ goal, but to encourage bots to use more of the layout, use other AssaultPaths\
      \ that meet up to that goal.  See [[Legacy:AssaultPath|AssaultPath]] and [[Legacy:Bot\
      \ Pathing|Bot Pathing]].\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://forums.unrealplayground.com/showthread.php?t=23758\

      \ the external link I wrote a while ago.  Toonce's vehicle pathing comments\
      \ added from [[Legacy:Pathing For Vehicles|Pathing for Vehicles]] and edited\
      \ slightly.  [[Legacy:XVehicleCTFGame|xVehicleCTFGame]], [[Legacy:RoadPathNode|RoadPathNode]],\
      \ [[Legacy:FlyingPathNode|FlyingPathNode]], [[Legacy:SpecialVehicleObjective|SpecialVehicleObjective]]\
      \ pages added and other misc links changed. ([[Legacy:NavigationPoint|NavigationPoint]]\
      \ subclass list, etc.)\n\n'''[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]''': Saw some\
      \ interesting bot behaviour when spectating a VCTF match with 2 bots. I used\
      \ AssaultPaths. So when a bot with a vehicle got to one, it left the vehicle,\
      \ took the flag and... Acted randomly. Usually, bots enter the vehicle with\
      \ which they came, then instantly exit. Some times though, they enter the vehicle,\
      \ drive in it for a few seconds and leave it. And the other times bots enter\
      \ the vehicle and drive nicely. When the bots get back on foot, they can use\
      \ their own vehicles near their base. Strangely, bots with flags enter the vehicle,\
      \ and again, some times they drive, and some times they just leave the vehicle.\
      \ Another strange addition is when a bot with a flag tries to return their own\
      \ flag. One time a bot in a tank killed a bot flag carrier, then drove very\
      \ near the dropped flag, returned it, then continued on foot, decided to get\
      \ into the tank again, ran back and stood near the vehicle, but didn't enter.\
      \ Another bot that was carrying the flag on foot killed another flag carrier\
      \ (it was on foot too), ran away from its own flag, decided to return it, returned\
      \ it, ran back to the AssaultPath and again tried to capture the enemy flag.\
      \ Any explanation on what's happening and what to do?\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
