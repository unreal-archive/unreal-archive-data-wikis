      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A map made up of nothing but a few large subtractions\
      \ and a few lights is not sufficient. Detail is needed. How?</p>\n<p>The room\
      \ shapes themselves should be more than a cube. Extrusions and recessions, sloping,\
      \ etc. serve to break up the scale. The human mind needs comparisons to really\
      \ appreciate the scale of something. When you first played onslaught, you thought\
      \ a Goliath was unstoppable until you saw a Leviathan...</p>\n<p>On top of the\
      \ basic room structure, add detail with <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Static Mesh\">static meshes</a>. These help the player form a sense of\
      \ scale, making your bigger spaces seem that much more vast.</p>\n<p>Another\
      \ thing you can do is to try and change ceiling heights. That too will break\
      \ up your scale. One of the most effective tricks that architect <a href=\"\
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Frank\
      \ Lloyd Wright\">Wikipedia:Frank Lloyd Wright</a> used to do was have a tiny\
      \ entrance hallway with a low ceiling and then opened it up to a huge room giving\
      \ a sense of grandeur and making that room seem bigger. You can do that in UT\
      \ too.</p>\n<p>When you use columns try and put them on a wider base so they\
      \ are not straight. Using a cube as a base for round columns will also give\
      \ your geometry more variety. Maybe even make an I beam as they look pretty\
      \ rad. Aside from these possibly playing a role in your gameplay they will also\
      \ help add more variety to the map.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\
      Unity\">Unity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Making_Architecture?section=2\" title=\"Edit\
      \ section: Unity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>Another thing is unity. You may often see cool architectural elements like\
      \ trusses repeated throughout a building. This creates a sense of cohesiveness,\
      \ as if the whole building was made by the same group of people in a single\
      \ time period. Why would someone build a building out of mud with wooden beams\
      \ and have the doorway made out of riveted steel? They wouldn't, unless they're\
      \ insane, stupid, or happen to have a riveted steel doorway built and are only\
      \ capable of building a building out of mud and wooden (it's very unlikely though).\
      \ However, you could also have the approach that the structure was built by\
      \ aliens, who may have radically different ways about thinking about things\
      \ like this. Architecture that seems ludicrous to us may be perfectly normal\
      \ for them.</p>\n<p>Unity is just as important in outside spaces: you don't\
      \ want one side of the map to be like Mars and another like Earth – unless of\
      \ course you intend to tie it in with a dramatic feature like an eco dome or\
      \ something. The thing about themes is that it can make or break a player's\
      \ sense of immersion.</p>\n<p>Immersiveness and the sense of space play a huge\
      \ role in architecture. A good architect will account for what a person feels\
      \ when in a particular space. In the case of UT this means that you want the\
      \ player to be into your map. Think of it like this. You may have seen a movie\
      \ that you hated because everything was so stupidly unreal (no pun intended)\
      \ and made no sense. You couldn't get into it. That's what I mean. You need\
      \ a sense of cohesiveness and a dose of reality along with the helping of unreality.</p>\n\
      <p>While it's important that your map is coherent, beware of remaining too similar\
      \ throughout. While you do want repetition of key elements you want different\
      \ areas to contrast while still obeying the overall theme. DM-Tempest is a good\
      \ example of what I mean. You don't want to have a map that looks like it was\
      \ made out of a million identical lego blocks, so beware of overusing the same\
      \ static meshes and/or textures.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\
      Proportions\">Proportions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Making_Architecture?section=3\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Proportions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Proportions are very important. Fortunately if you\
      \ use the <a href=\"/Legacy:Grid\" title=\"Legacy:Grid\">grid</a> you already\
      \ are doing proportional work to some extent. The thing about proportions is\
      \ that they have a rhythm that makes it easier on the eyes. And let me tell\
      \ you beauty is easy on the eyes. In fact there was a study that the better\
      \ looking people are, the more proportional their facial elements are.</p>\n\
      <p><b>T1:</b> I want a link to tell me where this study is, and who did it.</p>\n\
      <p>So for example, in your room the walls may be twice as long as they are high.\
      \ The floor may have a raised platform about a quarter of its area in the center\
      \ and the ceiling has an opening right above it covering about half of the area.\
      \ This assumes that you aren't trying to evoke a chaotic feeling in the player,\
      \ and it also assumes that the level isn't a city after being hit by a nuke,\
      \ of course. If you have too much symmetry, the level becomes monotonous and\
      \ seems like it's made out of a million identical lego blocks. Try to have a\
      \ balance of symmetry and some very slight asymmetrical elements.</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Lights\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Lighting detail adds realism and atmosphere. Purely\
      \ ambient lighting generally isn't very good looking. A <a href=\"/Legacy:Light\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Light\">light actor</a> alone does not suffice.The light needs\
      \ to come from somewhere. That's where the architecture aspect comes in. Try\
      \ adding the static mesh \"HumanoidArchitecture.Lights.PanLightB\" behind your\
      \ light actor. Looks better, doesn't it? Lights are some of the most overlooked\
      \ things by new mappers.</p>\n<p>Coloring is a must for good atmosphere as well.\
      \ Try opening LightProperties and setting Saturation to 153. The light is now\
      \ red. LightSaturation sets the extent of coloration. Now set LightHue to 35.\
      \ The light is a good flame color.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you could have a beam\
      \ or something running over head with lights hanging from there. That may work\
      \ too. Exactly why should you do this? Well for one thing because you should.\
      \ When you break up the scale and make things less massier it becomes easier\
      \ for us to relate to them. In case you didn't notice, our species (at least\
      \ most of us) enjoys things it can relate to.</p>\n<p>Their are many ways to\
      \ make light sources. You could go into the <a href=\"/Legacy:2D_Shape_Editor\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:2D Shape Editor\">2D Shape Editor</a> and make some simple\
      \ shapes and turn them sideways in the editor and place a lightsource on them.\
      \ A good package for lightsource textures are in the mine.utx package. You could\
      \ also try to make a ground light that is right beside your hallways. These\
      \ stand out good with red lights. (Only use red lights in dark areas for coolness)\
      \ When your dealing with normal light sources you should scale down the radius\
      \ of your lights because it just looks better to have the contrasts between\
      \ the color from dark to light in your rooms as opposed to a totally bright\
      \ room with no unity. Don't use the disco lights, this is what we in the buisness\
      \ call a \"N00B |_1GH+1|\\|G\".</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"\
      ><a href=\"/File:Legacy_DavidMredlight.jpeg\" class=\"image\" title=\"This is\

      \ to try to add a <a href=\"/Legacy:Corona\" title=\"Legacy:Corona\">corona</a>\
      \ right in front of your light sources to make it stand out from down a hallway.\
      \ You might also want to try a <a href=\"/Legacy:Lightbox\" title=\"Legacy:Lightbox\"\
      >lightbox</a> too. Lightboxes do a good job when you place an item right under\
      \ them. You could easily make an overhead light that you can hang from the ceiling\
      \ by taking a rectangle and having two other rectangles coming out of the top\
      \ and extending to the roof. Those can also be substituted with chains or something\
      \ from the <a href=\"/Legacy:VolumetricBuilder\" title=\"Legacy:VolumetricBuilder\"\
      >VolumetricBuilder</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"\

      \ alien style level you might want to use some texture palette loops to make\
      \ the constant change in color. It adds to style but it looks kind of weird\
      \ from ground lights so I'd place them up near the ceiling.</p>\n<p>When your\
      \ dealing with liquids around you you might want to place some light around\
      \ by the lava or slime to give effect on the surroundings, you don't have to\
      \ lower the light radius so much with lava.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Interactive Environment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Another good thing to do is to make your map have\
      \ lots of interactivity so it never seems to be boring. You can use <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:AmbientSound\" title=\"Legacy:AmbientSound\">AmbientSound</a> to give\
      \ players a sense of environment. You can place these near water, lights, machinery\
      \ etc. You might also want to try to set up button activated traps and doors\
      \ to give the players more interactivity. Another thing is give the player a\
      \ dangerous area in the map. It gives the player something to be carefull of\
      \ and will most definitely keep you more on the edge in a battle. This can be\
      \ done easily in a space map where edges of plateforms mean your life. Also\
      \ can be done with lava or slime pits or maybe even a large rotating fan of\
      \ death. Or an Ion beam.</p>\n<p>You can also try to zone in an area and turn\
      \ it into a healing zone like HealPod by adding a <a href=\"/Legacy:ZoneInfo\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:ZoneInfo\">ZoneInfo</a> inside your zoned in area and go to\
      \ ZoneInfo and changing <code>bPainzone</code> to True and <code>DamagePerSecond</code>\
      \ to a <i>negative</i> value.</p>\n<p>Another great idea for an interactive\
      \ environment is to create lots of destructable terrain in your level; which\
      \ can be done buy subtracting things and making movers in its place and setting\
      \ them to move out of the level when shot (preferably by a rocket or and explosion).</p>\n\
      <p>Another thing you might consider is maybe some <a href=\"/Legacy:Laser_Trip_Bomb\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Laser Trip Bomb\">laser trip bombs</a>. You can use these to\
      \ make something valuable hard to get to. For example surround your redeemer\
      \ with lasers. Another good idea is just use <a href=\"/Legacy:ClientScriptedTexture\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:ClientScriptedTexture\">ClientScriptedTextures</a> or Mychaeel's\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Screen\" title=\"Legacy:Screen\">Screen</a> to give your\
      \ map some displays that will tell current ranks of players and other information.\
      \ Another crazy idea is touchplates that open up walls with special items like\
      \ shield belts in them. A nice idea is a trap room, where you have a room with\
      \ a powerup inside, but somebody from the outside can pull switch and kill everyone\
      \ inside, like for example in DM-Pressure.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After your done getting the general look of your map\
      \ you should go through it again and create some objects in the way like pillars\
      \ and remove pieces out of the floor. An overused cliche that is used everywhere\
      \ in first person shooters is a floor tile raised and moved over some and rotated\
      \ about 45 degrees. This might makes sense in a ancient stone ruins, but for\
      \ example in Doom 3 on the first level, it's as if some engineer got drunk and\
      \ decided to open random parts of the floor with a crowbar, exposing the electronics\
      \ beneath. You might also want to try to flood lower floors of your map with\
      \ a thin layer of water for extra looks (<a href=\"/Legacy:Snowdog\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Snowdog\">Snowdog</a>'s JB-Talaeron is a good example). Maybe remove\
      \ some planks in a wooden bridge. Crates are ok too but they mostly block you\
      \ from the action so stick them in corners and not in the middle of your level,\
      \ unless you use them as cover or stairs. You might also want to put masked\
      \ weeds or chains on pillars an overhead beams to hang down and provide some\
      \ cover. When you make all your platforms and such you have to take into consideration\
      \ the weight of such things and what would it take for them to be suspended\
      \ above the ground. Use this idea to create lots of beams linking your platforms\
      \ to the walls and ground. Try to make all your beams connect together somewhere;\

      \ place everything on a path that the players would take so that it keeps the\
      \ action going. Health on the other hand should be against walls and corners\
      \ or even in a dangerous area so that it is more of a risk to get to because\

      Legacy:SkyBox\">SkyBox</a> all nice you may want to consider putting some architecture\
      \ in the way of the skybox to make it look nicer. This can be done in an inside\
      \ building map with simple overhead beams and maybe grates. In an outside map\
      \ it should be left fine because it just would look weird unless it goes with\
      \ the theme. Another thing to put infront of your skybox could be a window,\
      \ like a skywindow over the top of your level with beams going through it and\
      \ maybe even make the window breakable.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Glass_Break\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Making Glass Break\">Making Glass Break</a></p>\n<p>Not only\
      \ is the presentation of the skybox important, but the actual appearance of\
      \ it is just as vital. A proper skybox can give the player a true sense of awe\
      \ (for example, the player notices comets strewn throughout a starry sky, and\
      \ is so impressed that he/she is compelled to stop and look up for a few seconds).\
      \ For outdoor maps, one technique is to make two sheets (one higher than the\
      \ other) leaving the lower sheet to be translucent. By mixing and matching the\
      \ textures of each sheet (cloud textures, skies, space etc.) and by placing\
      \ lights in between the sheets, one can achieve more realistic skies. It's also\
      \ a good idea to make the sky in your skybox pan (in the case of the two-sheets\
      \ example, making one pan at an angle slightly greater than that of the other\
      \ sheet is realistic).</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"\

      \ on ground level and on raised platforms. Another good idea may be to use <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Teleporter\" title=\"Legacy:Teleporter\">teleporters</a>. When\
      \ you design large rooms and they seem so boring try to add ledges around them.\
      \ When making lifts try not to make one so that when you get in you have to\

      \ Give the players the choice of going up the slower stairs, or going up the\

      \ from their home or their school. In real life, many rooms have a single entrance\
      \ / exit, and a layout designed for watching TV, preparing food, or listening\
      \ to the lecture. This is not the purpose of spaces in UT. In UT your tasks\
      \ are pretty much kill, avoid being killed, hide, or get to a pickup.</p>\n\
      <p>Look at the options a player has at any given point in your map. I wouldn't\
      \ want to be walking down the long narrow corridor between two rooms when a\
      \ guy appears at the far end stacking up multiple rockets. What are my escape\
      \ routes? Similarly, After getting to a pickup, it's a good feeling to be able\
      \ to choose from a couple of options about where to go next <i>without having\
      \ to turn back</i>. If you look at good maps, you rarely see actual definable\
      \ rooms: you see a large space with BSP slightly limiting where you can go,\
      \ what you can see, and who can get you: this is a sign of good flow. Avoid\
      \ the \"room, corridor, room\" syndrome, loathed by all reviewers. The exception\
      \ is when you place a good powerup like a redeemer or udamage in a narrow hall,\
      \ making it risky to go and get it, but worth the risk. It forces the player\
      \ to make a choice: \"Do I go into that narrow hall with only one way out and\
      \ get the 'deemer, and possibly getting mowed down before I can reach it, or\
      \ not?\"</p>\n<p>Think of flow as a way to move around a level, multiple ways\
      \ in and out of each area. Each area feels different. Kickers, lifts and teleporters\
      \ everywhere. No hassle to get to any guns or ammo. No problem finding health.</p>\n\
      <p>You can tell if a level has flow if you know where a weapon is going to be\
      \ placed, or what must be done to open that special door. Just things mappers\
      \ do a lot that help you quickly get a complex map down pat while playing that\
      \ make it all that better. Try to avoid cubish maps, or perhaps start with a\
      \ cube and shape it. Think of z-axis gameplay all the time. Unless your going\
      \ for a total carnage approach you might want extra ledges and breaking up the\
      \ height scale on things. That way you can shoot at things from all angles.</p>\n\

      \ discovered what may be a simple and yet professional looking approch. Make\
      \ note I have not used it yet in level design but so far I think it may help\
      \ those cube looking hallways and such really take form and flow with the same\
      \ theme throughout the level. Ok here I go at explaining this one. First just\
      \ make different parts of your map. Like make a high detailed 512X512X512 area\
      \ which can be used as a hallway section. Then copy paste that to a layout.\
      \ Or wherever you may see fit. And then next make high detailed corners and\
      \ so on. Do all the parts seperate then connect them. It also allows you to\
      \ put the details and things very early on so that you can build on them later.\
      \ But it will provide a nice looking template for the level if you run out of\
      \ good ideas for some parts. And you can also use your little template area\
      \ for other maps too. Lol some of my maps have been really rushed, I dont even\
      \ want to talk about fractal 2. Must have been on crack that day. But the next\
      \ thing to be released I will try this approch. Seems to look nice so far though.\
      \ As for the layout, I usually end up freestyling them. If I ever plan anything\
      \ it usually turns out way off scale, no flow or connectivity so in my case\
      \ it's better to go with freestyling.</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b> Isn't this generally\

      \ feeling or mood can be placed into a level through perhaps lighting techniques.\
      \ Use the same colors throughout a level, or perhaps try for the same shadowcasts.\
      \ Gives a unique feeling. Or maybe you don't want to have anything look the\

      \ a whole. (-&gt; Cohesiveness...)</p>\n<p>It's about breaking lines too. If\

    text: "Some basic and advanced techniques to improve your level and to take into\
      \ consideration during the design process.\n\n==Break the Scale==\n\nA map made\
      \ up of nothing but a few large subtractions and a few lights is not sufficient.\
      \ Detail is needed. How?\n\nThe room shapes themselves should be more than a\
      \ cube. Extrusions and recessions, sloping, etc. serve to break up the scale.\
      \  The human mind needs comparisons to really appreciate the scale of something.\
      \  When you first played onslaught, you thought a Goliath was unstoppable until\
      \ you saw a Leviathan...\n\nOn top of the basic room structure, add detail with\
      \ [[Legacy:Static Mesh|static meshes]].  These help the player form a sense\
      \ of scale, making your bigger spaces seem that much more vast.\n\nAnother thing\
      \ you can do is to try and change ceiling heights.  That too will break up your\
      \ scale.  One of the most effective tricks that architect [[Wikipedia:Frank\
      \ Lloyd Wright]] used to do was have a tiny entrance hallway with a low ceiling\
      \ and then opened it up to a huge room giving a sense of grandeur and making\
      \ that room seem bigger.  You can do that in UT too.\n\nWhen you use columns\
      \ try and put them on a wider base so they are not straight. Using a cube as\
      \ a base for round columns will also give your geometry more variety.  Maybe\
      \ even make an I beam as they look pretty rad.  Aside from these possibly playing\
      \ a role in your gameplay they will also help add more variety to the map.\n\
      \n==Unity==\n\nAnother thing is unity.  You may often see cool architectural\
      \ elements like trusses repeated throughout a building.  This creates a sense\
      \ of cohesiveness, as if the whole building was made by the same group of people\
      \ in a single time period.  Why would someone build a building out of mud with\
      \ wooden beams and have the doorway made out of riveted steel?  They wouldn't,\
      \ unless they're insane, stupid, or happen to have a riveted steel doorway built\
      \ and are only capable of building a building out of mud and wooden (it's very\
      \ unlikely though). However, you could also have the approach that the structure\
      \ was built by aliens, who may have radically different ways about thinking\
      \ about things like this. Architecture that seems ludicrous to us may be perfectly\
      \ normal for them.\n\nUnity is just as important in outside spaces: you don't\
      \ want one side of the map to be like Mars and another like Earth &ndash; unless\
      \ of course you intend to tie it in with a dramatic feature like an eco dome\
      \ or something.  The thing about themes is that it can make or break a player's\
      \ sense of immersion.\n\nImmersiveness and the sense of space play a huge role\
      \ in architecture.  A good architect will account for what a person feels when\
      \ in a particular space.  In the case of UT this means that you want the player\
      \ to be into your map.  Think of it like this.  You may have seen a movie that\
      \ you hated because everything was so stupidly unreal (no pun intended) and\
      \ made no sense.  You couldn't get into it.  That's what I mean.  You need a\
      \ sense of cohesiveness and a dose of reality along with the helping of unreality.\n\
      \nWhile it's important that your map is coherent, beware of remaining too similar\
      \ throughout. While you do want repetition of key elements you want different\
      \ areas to contrast while still obeying the overall theme. DM-Tempest is a good\
      \ example of what I mean. You don't want to have a map that looks like it was\
      \ made out of a million identical lego blocks, so beware of overusing the same\
      \ static meshes and/or textures.\n\n==Proportions==\n\nProportions are very\
      \ important.  Fortunately if you use the [[Legacy:Grid|grid]] you already are\
      \ doing proportional work to some extent.  The thing about proportions is that\
      \ they have a rhythm that makes it easier on the eyes.  And let me tell you\
      \ beauty is easy on the eyes.  In fact there was a study that the better looking\
      \ people are, the more proportional their facial elements are.\n\n'''T1:'''\
      \ I want a link to tell me where this study is, and who did it.\n\nSo for example,\
      \ in your room the walls may be twice as long as they are high.  The floor may\
      \ have a raised platform about a quarter of its area in the center and the ceiling\
      \ has an opening right above it covering about half of the area. This assumes\
      \ that you aren't trying to evoke a chaotic feeling in the player, and it also\
      \ assumes that the level isn't a city after being hit by a nuke, of course.\
      \ If you have too much symmetry, the level becomes monotonous and seems like\
      \ it's made out of a million identical lego blocks. Try to have a balance of\
      \ symmetry and some very slight asymmetrical elements.\n\n==Lights==\n\nLighting\
      \ detail adds realism and atmosphere. Purely ambient lighting generally isn't\
      \ very good looking. A [[Legacy:Light|light actor]] alone does not suffice.The\
      \ light needs to come from somewhere. That's where the architecture aspect comes\
      \ in. Try adding the static mesh \"HumanoidArchitecture.Lights.PanLightB\" behind\
      \ your light actor. Looks better, doesn't it?  Lights are some of the most overlooked\
      \ things by new mappers. \n\nColoring is a must for good atmosphere as well.\
      \ Try opening LightProperties and setting Saturation to 153. The light is now\
      \ red. LightSaturation sets the extent of coloration. Now set LightHue to 35.\
      \ The light is a good flame color.\n\nAlternatively you could have a beam or\
      \ something running over head with lights hanging from there.  That may work\
      \ too.  Exactly why should you do this?  Well for one thing because you should.\
      \  When you break up the scale and make things less massier it becomes easier\
      \ for us to relate to them.  In case you didn't notice, our species (at least\
      \ most of us) enjoys things it can relate to.\n\nTheir are many ways to make\
      \ light sources. You could go into the [[Legacy:2D Shape Editor|2D Shape Editor]]\
      \ and make some simple shapes and turn them sideways in the editor and place\
      \ a lightsource on them. A good package for lightsource textures are in the\
      \ mine.utx package. You could also try to make a ground light that is right\
      \ beside your hallways. These stand out good with red lights. (Only use red\
      \ lights in dark areas for coolness) When your dealing with normal light sources\
      \ you should scale down the radius of your lights because it just looks better\
      \ to have the contrasts between the color from dark to light in your rooms as\
      \ opposed to a totally bright room with no unity. Don't use the disco lights,\
      \ this is what we in the buisness call a \"N00B |_1GH+1|\\|G\".\n\n[[Image:Legacy_DavidMredlight.jpeg|center|This\
      \ is the DavidM red light that everyone hears about. 200 brightness, 8 radius,\
      \ reddish color.]]\n\nYou might also want to try to add a [[Legacy:Corona|corona]]\
      \ right in front of your light sources to make it stand out from down a hallway.\
      \ You might also want to try a [[Legacy:Lightbox|lightbox]] too. Lightboxes\
      \ do a good job when you place an item right under them. You could easily make\
      \ an overhead light that you can hang from the ceiling by taking a rectangle\
      \ and having two other rectangles coming out of the top and extending to the\
      \ roof. Those can also be substituted with chains or something from the [[Legacy:VolumetricBuilder|VolumetricBuilder]].\n\
      \n[[Image:Legacy_CoronaHallway.jpeg|center|Here is an example of viewing a corona\
      \ from down a hallway. Really stands out from a distance.]]\n\nIf you got the\
      \ spaceship alien style level you might want to use some texture palette loops\
      \ to make the constant change in color. It adds to style but it looks kind of\
      \ weird from ground lights so I'd place them up near the ceiling.\n\nWhen your\
      \ dealing with liquids around you you might want to place some light around\
      \ by the lava or slime to give effect on the surroundings, you don't have to\
      \ lower the light radius so much with lava.\n\n==Interactive Environment==\n\
      \nAnother good thing to do is to make your map have lots of interactivity so\
      \ it never seems to be boring. You can use [[Legacy:AmbientSound|AmbientSound]]\
      \ to give players a sense of environment. You can place these near water, lights,\
      \ machinery etc. You might also want to try to set up button activated traps\
      \ and doors to give the players more interactivity. Another thing is give the\
      \ player a dangerous area in the map. It gives the player something to be carefull\
      \ of and will most definitely keep you more on the edge in a battle. This can\
      \ be done easily in a space map where edges of plateforms mean your life. Also\
      \ can be done with lava or slime pits or maybe even a large rotating fan of\
      \ death. Or an Ion beam.\n\nYou can also try to zone in an area and turn it\
      \ into a healing zone like HealPod by adding a [[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]]\
      \ inside your zoned in area and go to ZoneInfo and changing <code>bPainzone</code>\
      \ to True and <code>DamagePerSecond</code> to a ''negative'' value.\n\nAnother\
      \ great idea for an interactive environment is to create lots of destructable\
      \ terrain in your level; which can be done buy subtracting things and making\
      \ movers in its place and setting them to move out of the level when shot (preferably\
      \ by a rocket or and explosion).\n\nAnother thing you might consider is maybe\
      \ some [[Legacy:Laser Trip Bomb|laser trip bomb]]s. You can use these to make\
      \ something valuable hard to get to. For example surround your redeemer with\
      \ lasers. Another good idea is just use [[Legacy:ClientScriptedTexture|ClientScriptedTexture]]s\
      \ or Mychaeel's [[Legacy:Screen|Screen]] to give your map some displays that\
      \ will tell current ranks of players and other information. Another crazy idea\
      \ is touchplates that open up walls with special items like shield belts in\
      \ them. A nice idea is a trap room, where you have a room with a powerup inside,\
      \ but somebody from the outside can pull switch and kill everyone inside, like\
      \ for example in DM-Pressure.\n\n==Fill in the Blanks of Your Map==\n\nAfter\
      \ your done getting the general look of your map you should go through it again\
      \ and create some objects in the way like pillars and remove pieces out of the\
      \ floor. An overused cliche that is used everywhere in first person shooters\
      \ is a floor tile raised and moved over some and rotated about 45 degrees. This\
      \ might makes sense in a ancient stone ruins, but for example in Doom 3 on the\
      \ first level, it's as if some engineer got drunk and decided to open random\
      \ parts of the floor with a crowbar, exposing the electronics beneath. You might\
      \ also want to try to flood lower floors of your map with a thin layer of water\
      \ for extra looks ([[Legacy:Snowdog|Snowdog]]'s JB-Talaeron is a good example).\
      \ Maybe remove some planks in a wooden bridge. Crates are ok too but they mostly\
      \ block you from the action so stick them in corners and not in the middle of\
      \ your level, unless you use them as cover or stairs. You might also want to\
      \ put masked weeds or chains on pillars an overhead beams to hang down and provide\
      \ some cover. When you make all your platforms and such you have to take into\
      \ consideration the weight of such things and what would it take for them to\
      \ be suspended above the ground. Use this idea to create lots of beams linking\
      \ your platforms to the walls and ground. Try to make all your beams connect\
      \ together somewhere; it looks nice and fills in spaces.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_AmonPlanks.jpeg|center|A\
      \ nice example of the work of Hourences... Non-stop action and masterful details.]]\n\
      \n==Gravity/Velocity Changes ==\n\nIf you are doing a space map or something\
      \ with an antigravity room you might want to try to zone in the room with lots\
      \ of [[Legacy:Zone Portal|zone portal]]s and then add a [[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]]\
      \ in the area and set the <code>ZoneGravity</code> property. You can also change\
      \ the <code>ZoneVelocity</code> property in ZoneInfo to make it feel like your\
      \ being pulled up or down or where ever, works great if you have a fan somewhere\
      \ or a zip tube of somesort. [[Legacy:Kicker|Kicker]]s are a great thing to\
      \ have in a spacemap and can really get the flow and [[Legacy:Z-Axis|z-axis]]\
      \ fighting going. In UT2003/2004 you should probably use volumes instead.\n\n\
      [[Image:Legacy_KickerAction.jpeg|center|A perfect example of how to keep flow\
      \ going everywhere with kickers.]]\n\nEver hear of a gravity kicker? Try to\
      \ make a tube or a pit with gravity going backwards, you'll see just how neat\
      \ it actually is. Or another neat idea is to surround your level with volumes\
      \ that are all backwards gravity to the direction. Meaning that say you shoot\
      \ something and miss your enemy, it will turn around and fly back at you. Creating\
      \ a whole new theme for a level. See, gravity aint so bad now is it!\n\n==Add\
      \ New Textures To Old Surfaces ==\n\nA good way to get rid of the boring old\
      \ plain textures on walls, floors and ceilings is to make a cube or whatever\
      \ shape you want and add it to the surface of another texture. It makes it appear\
      \ to be part of it and will randomize your textures and make them look good.\
      \ You can use this to make good looking edges around ramps and floors and to\
      \ simulate carpets on the floors. You can even place those CTF symbols on the\
      \ walls which is handy when your mapping for CTF. Easy as adding (not subtracting)\
      \ a textured cube right under your work.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_BrushSinking.jpeg|center|Brush\
      \ sinking action on the sides of all the plateforms.]]\n\n[[Legacy:Brush Sinking|Brush\
      \ Sinking]] explains this technique in detail.\n\n==When Placing Items==\n\n\
      When you start to place items you might not want them to be sitting on flat\
      \ ground because that would be quite boring indeed. You might want to create\
      \ thin cylinder brush for it to sit on or maybe make some kind of stair set\
      \ in a corner going up to the item. In UT2003/2004 xWeaponBases already serve\
      \ this function. You might also want to place items in holes in the floor. Another\
      \ thing to remember when placing weapons is to place them where someone is going\
      \ to be. Not in a corner of a wide open area. Try to place everything on a path\
      \ that the players would take so that it keeps the action going. Health on the\
      \ other hand should be against walls and corners or even in a dangerous area\
      \ so that it is more of a risk to get to because you have to leave your normal\
      \ path. Ammo should most likely be by your weapon but if you spread it around\
      \ you wont do that much harm. It makes it a challenge to keep killing with a\
      \ good gun. See [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]] and [[Legacy:Inventory Item Placement|Inventory\
      \ Item Placement]] for more.\n \n\n[[Image:Legacy_Weaponshot.jpeg|center|This\
      \ is not a boring space to go for a weapon. You have to climb up into an open\
      \ area and notice the brush sinking underneath the weapon.]]\n\n==Skybox Seems\
      \ Plain &ndash; What Do I Do?==\n\nWhen you make your [[Legacy:SkyBox|SkyBox]]\
      \ all nice you may want to consider putting some architecture in the way of\
      \ the skybox to make it look nicer. This can be done in an inside building map\
      \ with simple overhead beams and maybe grates. In an outside map it should be\
      \ left fine because it just would look weird unless it goes with the theme.\
      \ Another thing to put infront of your skybox could be a window, like a skywindow\
      \ over the top of your level with beams going through it and maybe even make\
      \ the window breakable.\n\nSee [[Legacy:Making Glass Break|Making Glass Break]]\n\
      \nNot only is the presentation of the skybox important, but the actual appearance\
      \ of it is just as vital. A proper skybox can give the player a true sense of\
      \ awe (for example, the player notices comets strewn throughout a starry sky,\
      \ and is so impressed that he/she is compelled to stop and look up for a few\
      \ seconds). For outdoor maps, one technique is to make two sheets (one higher\
      \ than the other) leaving the lower sheet to be translucent. By mixing and matching\
      \ the textures of each sheet (cloud textures, skies, space etc.) and by placing\
      \ lights in between the sheets, one can achieve more realistic skies. It's also\
      \ a good idea to make the sky in your skybox pan (in the case of the two-sheets\
      \ example, making one pan at an angle slightly greater than that of the other\
      \ sheet is realistic). \n\n[[Image:Legacy_AmonSkybox.jpeg|center|A shot from\
      \ Hourences' DM-Amon. Some nice architecture in the way of the skybox to add\
      \ effect. Try to picture that missing... Just won't happen will it.]]\n\nParticle\
      \ effects in skyboxes can also be a good effect.\n\n==Level Layout Tips==\n\n\
      When designing a level it is really all up to you to do but you might want to\
      \ consider a few things. When linking rooms try to provide multiple ways in\
      \ and out of them to get good flow going; you can do this by putting hallways\
      \ on ground level and on raised platforms. Another good idea may be to use [[Legacy:Teleporter|teleporter]]s.\
      \ When you design large rooms and they seem so boring try to add ledges around\
      \ them. When making lifts try not to make one so that when you get in you have\
      \ to turn around to get out, unless it's part of the risk fact of using the\
      \ lift. Give the players the choice of going up the slower stairs, or going\
      \ up the faster lift that requires turning around.\n\n==Think Technically==\n\
      \nCreated a nice ledge or machine in the level? Think that's enough? Well you're\
      \ WRONG! As mentioned above, we like something we can relate to, so always think\
      \ about making it as realistic as possible, unless in 0 gravity, or it's made\
      \ out of some kind of super-light but strong material, that ledge or machine\
      \ or very high wall is gonna need supports to keep it standing, you could even\
      \ have a trigger to snap the supports and make the object fall down, killing\
      \ anyone underneath it, MUAH HU HU HU HA HA HAAA!!! See [[Legacy:Triggers (UT)|Triggers\
      \ (UT)]], [[Legacy:Mover|Mover]] and [[Legacy:Making Glass Break|Making Glass\
      \ Break]] to make this happen (you'll have to make the wall break instead though)\n\
      \n[[Image:Legacy_supports.jpeg|center|Here you can see the supports holding\
      \ up the grating platform, taken from my DM-Encarceration (still in development)]]\n\
      \n==It's All About Flow==\n\nNewbie mappers might make the mistake of drawing\
      \ inspiration from their home or their school.  In real life, many rooms have\
      \ a single entrance / exit, and a layout designed for watching TV, preparing\
      \ food, or listening to the lecture.  This is not the purpose of spaces in UT.\
      \  In UT your tasks are pretty much kill, avoid being killed, hide, or get to\
      \ a pickup.  \n\nLook at the options a player has at any given point in your\
      \ map.  I wouldn't want to be walking down the long narrow corridor between\
      \ two rooms when a guy appears at the far end stacking up multiple rockets.\
      \  What are my escape routes?  Similarly,  After getting to a pickup, it's a\
      \ good feeling to be able to choose from a couple of options about where to\
      \ go next ''without having to turn back''.  If you look at good maps, you rarely\
      \ see actual definable rooms: you see a large space with BSP slightly limiting\
      \ where you can go, what you can see, and who can get you: this is a sign of\
      \ good flow.  Avoid the \"room, corridor, room\" syndrome, loathed by all reviewers.\
      \ The exception is when you place a good powerup like a redeemer or udamage\
      \ in a narrow hall, making it risky to go and get it, but worth the risk. It\
      \ forces the player to make a choice: \"Do I go into that narrow hall with only\
      \ one way out and get the 'deemer, and possibly getting mowed down before I\
      \ can reach it, or not?\"\n\nThink of flow as a way to move around a level,\
      \ multiple ways in and out of each area. Each area feels different.  Kickers,\
      \ lifts and teleporters everywhere.  No hassle to get to any guns or ammo. No\
      \ problem finding health.\n\nYou can tell if a level has flow if you know where\
      \ a weapon is going to be placed, or what must be done to open that special\
      \ door. Just things mappers do a lot that help you quickly get a complex map\
      \ down pat while playing that make it all that better. Try to avoid cubish maps,\
      \ or perhaps start with a cube and shape it. Think of z-axis gameplay all the\
      \ time. Unless your going for a total carnage approach you might want extra\
      \ ledges and breaking up the height scale on things. That way you can shoot\
      \ at things from all angles.\n\nSee [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]] for more.\n\
      \n==Approaches To Level Design==\n\nEveryone has to start out somewhere, with\
      \ a blank area. But everyone has their own approach at creating their levels.\n\
      \nThe Twiggman\n\n----\n\nI (The Twiggman) have just discovered what may be\
      \ a simple and yet professional looking approch. Make note I have not used it\
      \ yet in level design but so far I think it may help those cube looking hallways\
      \ and such really take form and flow with the same theme throughout the level.\
      \ Ok here I go at explaining this one. First just make different parts of your\
      \ map. Like make a high detailed 512X512X512 area which can be used as a hallway\
      \ section. Then copy paste that to a layout. Or wherever you may see fit. And\
      \ then next make high detailed corners and so on. Do all the parts seperate\
      \ then connect them. It also allows you to put the details and things very early\
      \ on so that you can build on them later. But it will provide a nice looking\
      \ template for the level if you run out of good ideas for some parts. And you\
      \ can also use your little template area for other maps too. Lol some of my\
      \ maps have been really rushed, I dont even want to talk about fractal 2. Must\
      \ have been on crack that day. But the next thing to be released I will try\
      \ this approch. Seems to look nice so far though. As for the layout, I usually\
      \ end up freestyling them. If I ever plan anything it usually turns out way\
      \ off scale, no flow or connectivity so in my case it's better to go with freestyling.\n\
      \n'''T1:''' Isn't this generally the idea behind staticmeshes?\n\n==Putting\
      \ Feelings Into A Level ==\n\nLets start with a quote from Hourences.\n\n\"\
      A feeling is being created by the perfect balance between all aspects, starting\
      \ from architecture, to details, to light, to music, to sound to effects etc.\
      \ cliches work fine too, all those things you see in horror movies for examples\
      \ its emotion, and emotions aren't bound to laws and rules, hard to make up\
      \ a schedule on how to work then.\"\n\nAs he stated, a feeling or mood can be\
      \ placed into a level through perhaps lighting techniques. Use the same colors\
      \ throughout a level, or perhaps try for the same shadowcasts. Gives a unique\
      \ feeling. Or maybe you don't want to have anything look the same. \n\n==Related\

      \ This page could use some screenshots, let's use example maps or existing maps\
      \ for easier understanding. So far, it's looking great :D\n\n\"Justus\" That's\
      \ what I thought myself more screenshots would help.\n\n'''The Twiggman''':\
      \ I'll see what I can do about the screenshots, I'll take a few example shots\
      \ and try the uploaded and see what happens. :)\n\n'''Luggage:''' I thought\
      \ this was about architecture... Wtf do items and ambientsounds have to do with\
      \ architecture? I'd figure that scaling, lighting and shapes are the most important\
      \ points about architecture. Lighting influences scale - dark stripes in corridors\
      \ create a sense of distance for example. Shapes are the very basic thing about\
      \ architecture. Not indiviual shapes, but the ''piece of architecture'' as a\
      \ whole. (-> Cohesiveness...)\n\nIt's about breaking lines too. If you create\
      \ your first corridor, you got lots of horizontal lines. Break them up with\
      \ some vertical \"trim\", and add some atmospheric lighting... and you've got\
      \ a w00ty stylish corridor. (Sorta)\n\nArchitecture ''flows''. It's not seperate\
      \ parts. It all goes together.\n\nThe rest is a question of style, i.e. your\
      \ personal development as an (architecture) artist.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  I think\
      \ some items here & on [[Legacy:Mapping For DM|Mapping For DM]] could be moved\
      \ to their own page. Some stuff could be moved to [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]]\
      \ or one of the [[Legacy:Lighting|Lighting]] pages.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''  One\
      \ thing that would be nice is some references to books on Architectural styles.\
      \  I've been trying to find one with lots of ''good pictures'' (cos I'm lazy)\
      \ but not suceeded so far.\n\n'''The Twiggman''' God knows how this turned out\
      \ to be another mapping tips guide but anyone can easily add tutorials to make\
      \ architecture. Their sure is a lot of tips in here; I usually put new information\
      \ that I find and use in here so it's quite a handy bunch to read up on.\n\n\
      '''Legal:''' Pics are broken :( Btw Twiggy, done any maps for SWAT 3 as Stickman?\n\
      \n'''The Twiggman''' Wow, haven't been around here in awhile. lol, no I haven't,\
      \ must be some other stick like person\n\n'''The Twiggman''' Still adding info\
      \ wherever possible to this source. It's a good read now and again.\n\n'''Sweavo:'''\
      \ I made some pretty substantial changes to a few parts - some rewrites, some\
      \ moving of paras.  I thought some parts lost the way a little bit, plus that\
      \ one para actually asking us to re-write it! ... But i've not addressed the\
      \ refactoring issue as I'm not familiar with the other pages mentioned.  Hope\
      \ I've not pee'd anyone off too much.\n\n----\n\n===Refactoring===\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ parts of this page should be moved to [[Legacy:Adding Polish To Maps|Adding\
      \ Polish To Maps]] and [[Legacy:Mapping Checklist|Mapping Checklist]].\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:'''\
      \ Yeah, and there should be a combined [[Legacy:Map Enhancements|Map Enhancements]]\
      \ page also.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' All design elements here are covered in [[Legacy:Map\
      \ Design|Map Design]] and [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]].  To me, this feels like\
      \ one big rant.  This should either be refactored into a tutorial or into the\
      \ above mentioned pages (i.e., [[Legacy:Adding Polish To Maps|Adding Polish\
      \ To Maps]] and [[Legacy:Mapping Checklist|Mapping Checklist]]).  \n\n----\n\
