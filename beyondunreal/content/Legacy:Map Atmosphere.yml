      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It must be said\
      \ that one of the greatest achievements of UT was the diversity and quality\
      \ of the maps that shipped with the game. Even though the maps within UT were\
      \ constrained by a harsh polygon limit each one managed to create its own unique\
      \ atmosphere and feeling.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately UT2003 managed to lose this\
      \ somewhere along the way. Much criticism has been heaped on the maps that shipped\
      \ with the game. Indeed as I consider the maps that shipped with UT2003 I can\
      \ only think of a few that have the same quality of atmosphere as the maps for\
      \ UT.</p>\n<p>What follows is a summary of what I believe went wrong. Bear in\
      \ mind that I'm writing from a position where I don't actually like the UT2003\
      \ game that much. It doesn't mean I'm wrong – just slightly biased.</p>\n<h3><span\

      ><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Map_Atmosphere?section=2\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: The Music\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Why is music important to a level? It provides a backdrop\
      \ to the theme of the level. A slow piece in a minor key gives a level a melancholy\
      \ and mournful backdrop. Upbeat music can provide a level with a feeling of\
      \ pace and life, even when the level in reality lacks it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The\
      \ music in UT was excellent. Whenever I get a game I go through an exercise\
      \ of listening to the music without playing the game. The music in UT is not\
      \ only quite diverse but also worth listening to. I occasionally still listen\
      \ to the music from Phobos or Tempest (to name two of my favourites). They are\
      \ excellent pieces. I even still play UT with the music every now and then –\
      \ high acclaim indeed given the number of hours of UT I have put in since its\
      \ release.</p>\n<p>The music from UT2003 is bland. I forced myself to sit through\
      \ every piece once. I have no intention of doing it again. It was an exercise\
      \ in patience and self-torture.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Verbatim\"\

      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I'd wholeheartedly agree about the music. The music in UT\
      \ was mostly very actiony and intense. The music in UT2003 is, with a few exceptions,\
      \ quite unobtrusive and ambient. The music in UT often also created an illusion\
      \ of a more dynamic environment. UT8, with it's piston sliding sound, made a\
      \ factory constructed from static BSP feel like the equipment was running. Superfist\
      \ just sounds so fast, it's responsible for most of the wear on my car's back\
      \ tires.&#160;:P</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Themes\">The\
      \ Themes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Map_Atmosphere?section=4\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ The Themes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <hr />\n<p>The maps in UT were quite diverse. It felt like you were playing\
      \ in many different places from many different times. Even given the limitations\
      \ of the engine at the time each map manages to stand out from the others. The\
      \ maps are distinguishable from each other and clearly separate.</p>\n<p>This\
      \ is not the case in UT2003. The maps seem to have blended together into some\
      \ sort of techno mulch. The maps don't really manage to stand apart from each\
      \ other. There are some exceptions to this though. Asbestos, Magma, and Maul\
      \ have very definite themes and to my mind stand out from the rather bland crowd\
      \ they find themselves in. Now that I think on it those maps also play very\
      \ well.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Verbatim_2\">Verbatim</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Map_Atmosphere?section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Verbatim\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ I also think that the locales were better in UT. UT felt like you were fighting\
      \ in a factory/church/run-down apartment building/whatever while most UT2003\
      \ levels have the feel of playing in a proper arena. It's like military simulation\
      \ paintball versus tournament paintball. In UT you were fighting a pitched battle\
      \ in an Aztec ruin, in UT2003 you're just hiding behind a high-detail inflatable\
      \ cone that looks like a pyramid over ashphalt painted to look like sand.</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> I've often wondered if there comes a point where the\
      \ more detail that is added actually detracts from the perceived \"reality\"\
      \ of a level. My theory goes like this: <i>The closer detail becomes to real-life\
      \ the more obvious the shortcomings become thus reducing the amount of immersion.</i>.\
      \ Essentially the brain stops subconciously filling in the gaps and starts pointing\
      \ them out.</p>\n<p><b>Zxanphorian:</b> Yeah, i totally 100% agree on your theory\
      \ ent, because, look at DM-Conveyor and CTF-Gauntlet, for example. They look\
      \ more like factories and industrial areas than any industrial map in UT2003\
      \ can be like. I believe that more gamers would gravitate to a warish, military-like\
      \ games (like i do) than sports-theme games. If you want sports, get a sports\
      \ game. Games that combine sports with war-like situations are a no. ... I felt\
      \ that there was a \"life\" in UT, and UT2003 seems lifeless; there isn't any\
      \ soul in UT2003.</p>\n<p><b>RDGDanClark:</b> I'm not so sure, some of the most\
      \ popular maps are based around themes that aren't war related. Even in UT1\
      \ we had great maps based on hockey, football and soccer. Maps like CTF-Bedrooms\
      \ (in it's many incarnations) aren't really warlike situations. On the other\
      \ hand, trying to turn a war-style game into a sports game (i.e. Bombing Run)\
      \ doesn't do much for me. Trying to turn UT into Madden is a bad idea.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Well, we'll just call that Urban Warfare.&#160;:P Seriously\
      \ though, I think that most UT2003 maps feel like an arena dressed up as a real\
      \ environment, rather than a real combat environment. Good for gameplay maybe,\
      \ but I think the atmosphere is just as important.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ I'm not convinced there is anything inherently wrong with Boming Run as a\
      \ gametype. At the end of the day you still need to kill off the opposing team\
      \ if you want to stand a chance of winning. If you take out the whole \"commentator/sports\"\
      \ concept behind UT2003 and keep the idea of Bombing Run it suddenly becomes\
      \ more palatable. I do wonder if they simply tried to hard when putting the\
      \ maps together - that is - started with an idea for map flow and then build\
      \ the environment around it rather than put the environment together and fit\
      \ the map flow within it.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Map_Flow\"\
      >Map Flow</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Map_Atmosphere?section=6\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Map Flow\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Having started writing this piece I realise that the biggest factor in the\
      \ \"blandness\" of the UT2003 maps over the UT maps is the map flow. As a general\
      \ rule the maps in UT really worked. They played as great as they looked. Sure\
      \ there are some generally accepted balance issues on a couple of the maps but\
      \ even so the maps played well. The same cannot be said for the UT2003 maps\
      \ – even though they all look gorgeous.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I think the following\
      \ things contribute to this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The new scaling of the player size\
      \ means that the players look out of place within the maps. They players just\
      \ look too small for the environments they find themselves in.</li>\n<li>The\
      \ new jumping moves change the way the game is played significantly. In UT you\
      \ could dodge across the map to cross the map in an extra second or so. In UT2003\
      \ you have to dodge-jump everywhere just to keep up. There is a map whose name\
      \ I'll remember in a minute (CTF-Core I think) where you feel like you want\
      \ to dodge jump down a set of steps. It's something you can't do without hitting\
      \ the ceiling. This just breaks the map flow for me every time I do it.</li>\n\
      <li>The move to static meshes changed the way maps were built. The change is\
      \ very profound and I suspect the re-use of the static meshes across all of\
      \ the maps has more to do with the bland \"didn't I just play this map\" feel\
      \ of them than most other things.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To back up that last point\
      \ - DE's Grendel Keep is an excellent level. It flows well and has great atmosphere.\
      \ It's also very \"clean\" in terms of detail. There is a definate lack of meshes\
      \ to get caught on, and the majority of meshes that are used are used for decorative\
      \ purposes - in much the same way as semi-solids were used in UT.</p>\n<h4><span\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p><b>Zxanphorian:</b>Also, another way I felt more immersed\
      \ in UT is characters. The first time i played against the Skaarj Hybrids in\
      \ UT, I was admittenly scared of them, and my hand, grabbing the mouse, jumped\
      \ away from the computer desk. That didn't happen in UT2003. At all. Also, the\
      \ boss in UT is and always will be more scarier than Malcolm in UT2003.</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> I'm sure the problem with the characters in UT2003 is\
      \ purely one of size rather than there being anything really wrong with them.\
      \ It's hard for me to pin down really as I find the character scaling so irritating.\
      \ I think the reason Xan is more scary then Malcolm is down to the choice of\
      \ level. Playing UT2003's Malcolm on UT's hyperblast would have been hardwork.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Zxanphorian:</b> You may say that because the UT2003 characters have too\
      \ many gadgets on them. In UT, they were cut and dry to the point.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ Nope. I've just finished re-testing my statement. If I set the xGame.xPawn\
      \ DrawScale to 1.25 then I find the game much more playable. The characters\
      \ seem to fit better into the environments. I don't know what the actual difference\
      \ is in height between UT and UT2003 - I just wanted something that looked right.</p>\n\
      <p><b>WheatPuppet:</b> I agree with the character design thing. In UT the most\
      \ \"out-there\" models (at least the ones that came boxed with the game) were\
      \ the Necroth ones. In UT2003 a lot of the models–esp. Mr. Crow and family–\
      have this S&amp;M quality that I find very hard to take seriously. I'm not looking\
      \ for high art in gameplay models–it's UT, after all–but I think they could've\
      \ done better than that.</p>\n<p><b>Erika:</b> Actually, UT200x characters are\
      \ taller than UT characters. The maps are just way too big and the characters\
      \ are way too lightly coloured that they appear to be small. UT2003 characters\
      \ are also really cartoony, which is a shame since the first UT was nice.</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte:</b> I'm pretty sure the UT200x characters have the same height\
      \ as the UT characters. The rooms might be smaller though.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ Jk&#160;:) Thanks Entropic! This gave me an idea of a page that has wikiers\
      \ write about a certain concept about gameplay, like map atmosphere. In those\
      \ pages there should be a main body that all people edit and a debate section,\
      \ that is self-explanitory. Nice job entropic for writing this piece. But, this\

      \ Feel free to hack and slash the body of the document around all you like.</p>\n\
      <p><b>StarWeaver:</b> Re the concept of UT vs 200x in general . . . Well, I\
      \ certainly remember feeling this way in the past. I remember when I first got\
      \ 2003, I think it was fairly new then, and I played it for a little while,\
      \ and then I said \"eh\" and went back to UT. But I got 2004 around Feb 2005,\
      \ and it worked a lot better for me then. Granted, I hadn't been playing FPSs\
      \ nearly as much at that point (was pretty much on an Neverwinter Nights kick),\
      \ so perhaps I had less immediate experience to compare it to, but . . . it\
      \ just seemed to be a lot more fun than 2003 was. And that was without onslaught\
      \ and assault and all that. Does anyone have any opinions on 2003 vs 2004? Are\
      \ the newer epic maps any better than the first batch for the engine? Maybe\
      \ the newer CBP and UCMP and the newer independant releases have hit the mark\
      \ a bit better?</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> I think UT 1 will always be better\
      \ than any UT200X or any of it's mod variants. Period. The Map Atmosphere (although\
      \ less 'tecky') is far more superior. That feeling like your part of the team\
      \ is great (unfortunately, not so great with ut200x). I recommend mapping for\
      \ UT 1 for the rest of your life. There's just not enough detail/atmosphere\
      \ that can be crammed into a UT200x Map.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Zxanphorian:</b>\

    text: "==Map Atmosphere UT and UT2003 (by EntropicLqd)==\n\nIt must be said that\
      \ one of the greatest achievements of UT was the diversity and quality of the\
      \ maps that shipped with the game.  Even though the maps within UT were constrained\
      \ by a harsh polygon limit each one managed to create its own unique atmosphere\
      \ and feeling.\n\nUnfortunately UT2003 managed to lose this somewhere along\
      \ the way.  Much criticism has been heaped on the maps that shipped with the\
      \ game.  Indeed as I consider the maps that shipped with UT2003 I can only think\
      \ of a few that have the same quality of atmosphere as the maps for UT.\n\n\
      What follows is a summary of what I believe went wrong.  Bear in mind that I'm\
      \ writing from a position where I don't actually like the UT2003 game that much.\
      \  It doesn't mean I'm wrong &ndash; just slightly biased.\n\n===The Music===\n\
      \nWhy is music important to a level?  It provides a backdrop to the theme of\
      \ the level.  A slow piece in a minor key gives a level a melancholy and mournful\
      \ backdrop.  Upbeat music can provide a level with a feeling of pace and life,\
      \ even when the level in reality lacks it.\n\n----\n\nThe music in UT was excellent.\
      \  Whenever I get a game I go through an exercise of listening to the music\
      \ without playing the game.  The music in UT is not only quite diverse but also\
      \ worth listening to.  I occasionally still listen to the music from Phobos\
      \ or Tempest (to name two of my favourites).  They are excellent pieces.  I\
      \ even still play UT with the music every now and then &ndash; high acclaim\
      \ indeed given the number of hours of UT I have put in since its release.\n\n\
      The music from UT2003 is bland.  I forced myself to sit through every piece\
      \ once.  I have no intention of doing it again.  It was an exercise in patience\
      \ and self-torture.\n\n====Verbatim====\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I'd wholeheartedly\
      \ agree about the music. The music in UT was mostly very actiony and intense.\
      \ The music in UT2003 is, with a few exceptions, quite unobtrusive and ambient.\
      \ The music in UT often also created an illusion of a more dynamic environment.\
      \ UT8, with it's piston sliding sound, made a factory constructed from static\
      \ BSP feel like the equipment was running. Superfist just sounds so fast, it's\
      \ responsible for most of the wear on my car's back tires. :P \n\n===The Themes===\n\
      \n----\n\nThe maps in UT were quite diverse.  It felt like you were playing\
      \ in many different places from many different times.  Even given the limitations\
      \ of the engine at the time each map manages to stand out from the others. \
      \ The maps are distinguishable from each other and clearly separate.\n\nThis\
      \ is not the case in UT2003.  The maps seem to have blended together into some\
      \ sort of techno mulch.  The maps don't really manage to stand apart from each\
      \ other.  There are some exceptions to this though.  Asbestos, Magma, and Maul\
      \ have very definite themes and to my mind stand out from the rather bland crowd\
      \ they find themselves in.  Now that I think on it those maps also play very\
      \ well.\n\n====Verbatim====\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I also think that the locales were\
      \ better in UT. UT felt like you were fighting in a factory/church/run-down\
      \ apartment building/whatever while most UT2003 levels have the feel of playing\
      \ in a proper arena. It's like military simulation paintball versus tournament\
      \ paintball. In UT you were fighting a pitched battle in an Aztec ruin, in UT2003\
      \ you're just hiding behind a high-detail inflatable cone that looks like a\
      \ pyramid over ashphalt painted to look like sand.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' I've\
      \ often wondered if there comes a point where the more detail that is added\
      \ actually detracts from the perceived \"reality\" of a level.  My theory goes\
      \ like this: ''The closer detail becomes to real-life the more obvious the shortcomings\
      \ become thus reducing the amount of immersion.''.  Essentially the brain stops\
      \ subconciously filling in the gaps and starts pointing them out.\n\n'''Zxanphorian:'''\
      \ Yeah, i totally 100% agree on your theory ent, because, look at DM-Conveyor\
      \ and CTF-Gauntlet, for example. They look more like factories and industrial\
      \ areas than any industrial map in UT2003 can be like. I believe that more gamers\
      \ would gravitate to a warish, military-like games (like i do) than sports-theme\
      \ games. If you want sports, get a sports game. Games that combine sports with\
      \ war-like situations are a no. ... I felt that there was a \"life\" in UT,\
      \ and UT2003 seems lifeless; there isn't any soul in UT2003.\n\n'''RDGDanClark:'''\
      \ I'm not so sure, some of the most popular maps are based around themes that\
      \ aren't war related. Even in UT1 we had great maps based on hockey, football\
      \ and soccer. Maps like CTF-Bedrooms (in it's many incarnations) aren't really\
      \ warlike situations. On the other hand, trying to turn a war-style game into\
      \ a sports game  (i.e. Bombing Run) doesn't do much for me. Trying to turn UT\
      \ into Madden is a bad idea.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Well, we'll just call that Urban\
      \ Warfare. :P Seriously though, I think that most UT2003 maps feel like an arena\
      \ dressed up as a real environment, rather than a real combat environment. Good\
      \ for gameplay maybe, but I think the atmosphere is just as important.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ I'm not convinced there is anything inherently wrong with Boming Run as a\
      \ gametype.  At the end of the day you still need to kill off the opposing team\
      \ if you want to stand a chance of winning.  If you take out the whole \"commentator/sports\"\
      \ concept behind UT2003 and keep the idea of Bombing Run it suddenly becomes\
      \ more palatable.  I do wonder if they simply tried to hard when putting the\
      \ maps together - that is - started with an idea for map flow and then build\
      \ the environment around it rather than put the environment together and fit\
      \ the map flow within it.\n\n===Map Flow===\n\nHaving started writing this piece\
      \ I realise that the biggest factor in the \"blandness\" of the UT2003 maps\
      \ over the UT maps is the map flow.  As a general rule the maps in UT really\
      \ worked.  They played as great as they looked.  Sure there are some generally\
      \ accepted balance issues on a couple of the maps but even so the maps played\
      \ well.   The same cannot be said for the UT2003 maps &ndash; even though they\
      \ all look gorgeous.\n\n----\n\nI think the following things contribute to this.\n\
      # The new scaling of the player size means that the players look out of place\
      \ within the maps.  They players just look too small for the environments they\
      \ find themselves in.\n# The new jumping moves change the way the game is played\
      \ significantly.  In UT you could dodge across the map to cross the map in an\
      \ extra second or so.  In UT2003 you have to dodge-jump everywhere just to keep\
      \ up.  There is a map whose name I'll remember in a minute (CTF-Core I think)\
      \ where you feel like you want to dodge jump down a set of steps.  It's something\
      \ you can't do without hitting the ceiling.  This just breaks the map flow for\
      \ me every time I do it.\n# The move to static meshes changed the way maps were\
      \ built.  The change is very profound and I suspect the re-use of the static\
      \ meshes across all of the maps has more to do with the bland \"didn't I just\
      \ play this map\" feel of them than most other things.\n\nTo back up that last\
      \ point - DE's Grendel Keep is an excellent level.  It flows well and has great\
      \ atmosphere.  It's also very \"clean\" in terms of detail.  There is a definate\
      \ lack of meshes to get caught on, and the majority of meshes that are used\
      \ are used for decorative purposes - in much the same way as semi-solids were\
      \ used in UT.\n\n====Verbatim====\n\n'''Erika:''' Static meshes also hinder\
      \ map flow because there is a larger chance to get stuck on a mesh in UT200x\
      \ than there is to get stuck on BSP in UT.\n\n===Characters===\n\n====Verbatim====\n\
      \n'''Zxanphorian:'''Also, another way I felt more immersed in UT is characters.\
      \ The first time i played against the Skaarj Hybrids in UT, I was admittenly\
      \ scared of them, and my hand, grabbing the mouse, jumped away from the computer\
      \ desk. That didn't happen in UT2003. At all. Also, the boss in UT is and always\
      \ will be more scarier than Malcolm in UT2003.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' I'm sure\
      \ the problem with the characters in UT2003 is purely one of size rather than\
      \ there being anything really wrong with them.  It's hard for me to pin down\
      \ really as I find the character scaling so irritating.  I think the reason\
      \ Xan is more scary then Malcolm is down to the choice of level.  Playing UT2003's\
      \ Malcolm on UT's hyperblast would have been hardwork.\n\n'''Zxanphorian:'''\
      \ You may say that because the UT2003 characters have too many gadgets on them.\
      \ In UT, they were cut and dry to the point.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Nope.  I've\
      \ just finished re-testing my statement.  If I set the xGame.xPawn DrawScale\
      \ to 1.25 then I find the game much more playable.  The characters seem to fit\
      \ better into the environments.  I don't know what the actual difference is\
      \ in height between UT and UT2003 - I just wanted something that looked right.\n\
      \n'''WheatPuppet:''' I agree with the character design thing. In UT the most\
      \ \"out-there\" models (at least the ones that came boxed with the game) were\
      \ the Necroth ones. In UT2003 a lot of the models&ndash;esp. Mr. Crow and family&ndash;have\
      \ this S&M quality that I find very hard to take seriously. I'm not looking\
      \ for high art in gameplay models&ndash;it's UT, after all&ndash;but I think\
      \ they could've done better than that.\n\n'''Erika:''' Actually, UT200x characters\
      \ are taller than UT characters. The maps are just way too big and the characters\
      \ are way too lightly coloured that they appear to be small. UT2003 characters\
      \ are also really cartoony, which is a shame since the first UT was nice.\n\n\
      '''El Muerte:''' I'm pretty sure the UT200x characters have the same height\
      \ as the UT characters.  The rooms might be smaller though.\n\n==Related Topics==\n\

      \ Sorry - I forgot about the apostrophes :(.  I normally write in notepad. \
      \ That should be better.\n\n'''Zxanphorian:''' AHHHHHH PAGE OVERRUN!!! Jk :)\
      \ Thanks Entropic! This gave me an idea of a page that has wikiers write about\
      \ a certain concept about gameplay, like map atmosphere. In those pages there\
      \ should be a main body that all people edit and a debate section, that is self-explanitory.\
      \ Nice job entropic for writing this piece. But, this piece needs more info\
      \ and examples. (may i edit the body?)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Feel free to hack\
      \ and slash the body of the document around all you like.\n\n'''StarWeaver:'''\
      \ Re the concept of UT vs 200x in general . . . Well, I certainly remember feeling\
      \ this way in the past. I remember when I first got 2003, I think it was fairly\
      \ new then, and I played it for a little while, and then I said \"eh\" and went\
      \ back to UT. But I got 2004 around Feb 2005, and it worked a lot better for\
      \ me then. Granted, I hadn't been playing FPSs nearly as much at that point\
      \ (was pretty much on an Neverwinter Nights kick), so perhaps I had less immediate\
      \ experience to compare it to, but . . . it just seemed to be a lot more fun\
      \ than 2003 was. And that was without onslaught and assault and all that. Does\
      \ anyone have any opinions on 2003 vs 2004? Are the newer epic maps any better\
      \ than the first batch for the engine? Maybe the newer CBP and UCMP and the\
      \ newer independant releases have hit the mark a bit better?\n\n'''MythOpus:'''\
      \ I think UT 1 will always be better than any UT200X or any of it's mod variants.\
      \  Period.  The Map Atmosphere (although less 'tecky') is far more superior.\
      \  That feeling like your part of the team is great (unfortunately, not so great\
      \ with ut200x).  I recommend mapping for UT 1 for the rest of your life.  There's\
      \ just not enough detail/atmosphere that can be crammed into a UT200x Map.\n\
