      \ *in view* at any time. Your level could have a great great GREAT deal more\

      \ tools to help with visibility, such as anti-portals and volumes.</p>\n<p>For\
      \ the most part we build level shells out of BSP at about 2-5 times the polys\

      \ meshes. These are built (most of the time) in a modular fashion, and pull\
      \ a lot of the weight level textures used to in UT. Instead of slapping a texture\
      \ on a wall, now you grab a couple of models and stick in front of the wall.\
      \ The modular designs allow for a great deal of detail in a level without having\
      \ to meticulously model a high-detail level. Building static mesh sets is pretty\
      \ fun stuff, especially when you get the payoff of seeing them all over the\

      <p>Actually, Ent, the prefab modeling and level design questions are completely\
      \ what I'm most familiar with, so no prob at all, ask away, detailed as you\
      \ like!</p>\n<p>No, nothing has replaced zones. They are still the best and\
      \ fastest way to break up a map. Volume is a general term that could be anything\
      \ from a damage volume to a volume that changes the physics within it. I imagine\
      \ you're pretty much refering to \"anti-portal volumes though (APV's if you\
      \ will)\"</p>\n<p>An APV or simple Anti-portal sheet is something you use only\
      \ when zoning won't do the trick for you. Rooms connected by hallways and so\
      \ forth should still be zones, but if a room is really big with an object in\
      \ the middle, you stick an APV in it, and it helps obscure things behind it\
      \ (in the same zone). Another key use is in terrain. Say you've got a map with\
      \ big hills on it. The whole outside is a single zone, but you don't wanna go\
      \ drawing the whole world when you're outside. So you take an anti-portal and\
      \ stick it in your major hills so the engine knows it doesn't need to draw things\
      \ on the other side.</p>\n<p>APVs can be any convex shape, preferably with low\
      \ polys. Honestly I don't think once in the game has one been used that wasn't\
      \ a simple cube though. it's not a big precision-mesh-fitting operation. Too\
      \ many anti-portals start to outweigh the benefits of themselves as well, don't\
      \ go dropping them in every little item just in case someone crouches behind\
      \ it.</p>\n<p>Naming areas can be done in Zone Infos, or a volume can be dragged\
      \ over an area that does nothing but change the location name.</p>\n<p>I don't\
      \ know why anyone would claim APVs don't work in multiplayer, they're a key\
      \ factor in getting maps running fast. They do.</p>\n<p>Fog does occlude polys\
      \ beyond it, yes. Unless a material specifically states it's double sided, the\
      \ engine doesn't draw the backs of polys. It's still a good idea to delete polys\
      \ you won't see, because there's still overhead with those polys as the engine\
      \ runs around talking to the vid card trying to decide wether it needs to draw\
      \ them or not.</p>\n<p>Level polys vary a great deal, it's just one of many\
      \ aspects you keep in mind. Overdraw from loads of particles have a big hit\
      \ (learn to make efficient emitters!), some materials slow it, etc. But if you're\
      \ just looking for a ballpark... 20K to 45K polys in view, onscreen, is pretty\
      \ reasonable. As said before though, it varies widely. You can find cases where\
      \ a test level pushes 600K polys at a steady 50 FPS, and you can find cases\
      \ with loads of materials and overdraw and gameplay issues that runs 12K polys\
      \ at 15FPS.</p>\n<p>Luckily there are many tools in game that let you pull up\
      \ stats and see exactly where your framerate is going as you run around a level,\
      \ it's pretty easy to spot problem areas.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\

      <blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>\"Collision for static meshes is specified\

      \ only have to do that once. As you do that, every instance of that wall mesh\

      \ not something you're jazzed about, or you've got something that should really\
      \ just be a cylinder or a box, in the little mesh browser you can create a collision\
      \ mesh with like 2 clicks. They're called DOPs, and essentially you tell it\
      \ which of the simple shapes you want and it shrink wraps that primative to\
      \ your object. It's very fast, very user friendly, and it speeds up player and\
      \ karma collision calculation VASTLY. BSP shells generally are only resorted\
      \ to if a DOP shape isn't really appropriate.</p>\n<p>By using these two collision\

    text: "The introduction of [[Legacy:Static Mesh|Static Mesh]]es has radically\
      \ changed how maps are built. In the [[Legacy:The Curse Of Static Meshes|The\
      \ Curse Of Static Meshes]] article, mappers explain their problems with this\
      \ new technique. Here you'll find solutions.\n\n==Acclimatizing ==\n\nrough\
      \ thoughts to refactor:\n\n* to get an idea of how to use SMs, use RMODE 3 in\
      \ game, or [[Legacy:Viewport Caption Context Menu|Viewport Caption Context Menu]]\
      \ -> Show -> Static meshes. \n* despite what has been said, maps are not mere\
      \ boxes with meshes: many maps still have a reasonably complex [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]],\
      \ with things like subtracts for lowered floor areas (in the first map of the\
      \ DD ladder)\n\nGetting used to SM... some rough ideas:\n\n* adapt DavidM's\
      \ old advice about mapping for UT: copy. Take a UT2003 map you like &ndash;\
      \ then rip it up and rip it off. Copy the style. Make corridors, entrances,\
      \ walkways etc the same way as in that map. If you feel brave, load up the SM\
      \ packages it uses and experiment with the other SMs in those packages.\n\n\
      ==Problems==\n\nQuick cures for static mesh ailments:\n\n===Finding the right\
      \ mesh===\n\nEpic's mesh packages are notorious for being an absolute mess,\
      \ with no logic to the way the meshes are organized. (Hello? 80% of meshes in\
      \ \"misc\" group?)\n\nTry our [[Legacy:Static Mesh Package/Index|Static Mesh\
      \ Package/Index]]. There's also an app being worked on that will let you search\
      \ them by keyword.\n\n===Meshes stuck in maps===\n\nIf you want to use any of\
      \ the static meshes Epic's or Digital Extremes' mappers put into their maps'\
      \ [[Legacy:MyLevel|MyLevel]] [[Legacy:Package|package]]s, you do not have to\
      \ re-import them into your own MyLevel package. Simply load the map they're\
      \ in in the static mesh browser as if it was a static mesh package (in fact,\
      \ since it contains static meshes, it's as good as one).\n\nHowever, some players\
      \ delete standard maps they do not like from their hard drive &ndash; mention\
      \ the dependency in your map's accompanying text file.\n\n===PrePivot===\n\n\
      Some meshes are ''always'' off-grid, no matter what you do to. This appears\
      \ to be down to shoddy work on the part of Epic. \n\nUse [[Legacy:Actor/Display|Display]]\
      \ -> PrePivot to put awkward meshes back on grid.\n\n===Scaling Textures===\n\
      \nSMs can be scaled to any size, which is great! But the texture they carry\
      \ is scaled too, and sometimes this looks like crud if you make the mesh too\
      \ large. \n\nCreate a [[Legacy:TexScaler|TexScaler]] in [[Legacy:MyLevel|MyLevel]]\
      \ to rescale textures in a flash for static meshes you've scaled. For example,\
      \ if you have doubled the size of the mesh, halved the size fo the texture to\
      \ compensate.\n\n===Bad lights===\n\nA number of light meshes have the actual\
      \ light part displaying a material that is ''set to unlit''. You can find normal\
      \ versions of the material if you look in the [[Legacy:Texture Package|texture\
      \ package]] it comes from, eg UCGeneric.\n\n===No back face===\n\nMeshes with\
      \ no back face &ndash; eg the windows in DM-Oceanic.\n\nYou might have to put\
      \ two meshes back to back, or create a two-side version of the material that\
      \ is applied. Or use CSG brushes to fill in the gaps.\n\n==Customizing ==\n\n\
      See [[Legacy:StaticMeshActor|StaticMeshActor]] for useful properties that can\
      \ be set to alter individual placed static meshes; see [[Legacy:Static Mesh|Static\
      \ Mesh]] for properties of the actual resource that can be edited.\n\nBriefly,\
      \ you can change the following aspects of a placed mesh:\n* size\n* rotation\n\
      * displayed textures\n\n==Opinions on static mesh mapping ==\n* [[Legacy:The\
      \ Curse Of Static Meshes|The Curse Of Static Meshes]] &ndash; the ''curse''\n\
      \n----\n\n''anything below here please refactor or delete!''\n\n----\n\n{{innerbox|\
      \ \nLee Perry (of Epic) writes on the Polycount Message Boards:\n\n\"Levels\
      \ and environment meshes are far more my area of expertise. There's many factors\
      \ that go into your frame rate of course, but it's normal to have about 30K\
      \ to 60K polys *in view* at any time. Your level could have a great great GREAT\
      \ deal more than than, it's all about what's visible, and there's many (easy\
      \ to use) new tools to help with visibility, such as anti-portals and volumes.\n\
      \nFor the most part we build level shells out of BSP at about 2-5 times the\
      \ polys of a UT level, and then we populate it very densely with environment\
      \ static meshes. These are built (most of the time) in a modular fashion, and\
      \ pull a lot of the weight level textures used to in UT. Instead of slapping\
      \ a texture on a wall, now you grab a couple of models and stick in front of\
      \ the wall. The modular designs allow for a great deal of detail in a level\
      \ without having to meticulously model a high-detail level. Building static\
      \ mesh sets is pretty fun stuff, especially when you get the payoff of seeing\
      \ them all over the web in everyone's levels, and largely used in ways you never\
      \ would of expected.\n\nYou could model 2-3 basic walls (built with edges on\
      \ a grid prederably), make a door, maybe a cieling piece or two, maybe 2 good\
      \ decoration pieces if you feel like it, and voilà you'll have 9000 user maps\
      \ using your prefabs everywhere they can fit them. It's cool to walk into a\
      \ room you modeled, and not really recognize it because it was built so differently\
      \ than you intended\"\n\nand\n\n\"Oh, BTW, for sea surfaces, you'd most likely\
      \ drop in a dynamic water plane and it would be generated realistically in a\
      \ way that should never tile. And you can set things like mesh resolution, wave\
      \ height, etc... on that\"\n\n\n\n}}\n\nSource: [http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~polycount/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006636.html?00168\
      \ Polycount Message Board]\n\n==General Forum on Static Meshes ==\n\nAmid cries\
      \ that \"Unreal Mapping is over\", let's establish some rough ideas. First of\
      \ all, people should realize that they're discussing based on suppositions.\n\
      \nModels may come to be treated much like textures are currently treated. That\
      \ is:\n* no-one complains that they can only use UT bundled textures, \n* there's\
      \ plenty of variety bundled with the game\n* Epic mappers such as CliffyB have\
      \ previously expressed surprise at the originality with which l33t community\
      \ mappers use the built-in textures\n* some people will specialize and create\
      \ model packs, the same way people produced texture packs.\n\nModel creating\
      \ will become an extra job in the process of making environments; this is a\
      \ natural direction to take since the complexity of the worlds is increasing.\n\
      \nSome more information taken from the Polycount message board (once again eepers\
      \ stumps up the goods).\n\n{{innerbox| \nLee Perry (of Epic) writes some more\
      \ on the Polycount Message Boards:\n\nActually, Ent, the prefab modeling and\
      \ level design questions are completely what I'm most familiar with, so no prob\
      \ at all, ask away, detailed as you like!\n\nNo, nothing has replaced zones.\
      \ They are still the best and fastest way to break up a map. Volume is a general\
      \ term that could be anything from a damage volume to a volume that changes\
      \ the physics within it. I imagine you're pretty much refering to \"anti-portal\
      \ volumes though (APV's if you will)\"\n\nAn APV or simple Anti-portal sheet\
      \ is something you use only when zoning won't do the trick for you. Rooms connected\
      \ by hallways and so forth should still be zones, but if a room is really big\
      \ with an object in the middle, you stick an APV in it, and it helps obscure\
      \ things behind it (in the same zone). Another key use is in terrain. Say you've\
      \ got a map with big hills on it. The whole outside is a single zone, but you\
      \ don't wanna go drawing the whole world when you're outside. So you take an\
      \ anti-portal and stick it in your major hills so the engine knows it doesn't\
      \ need to draw things on the other side.\n\nAPVs can be any convex shape, preferably\
      \ with low polys. Honestly I don't think once in the game has one been used\
      \ that wasn't a simple cube though. it's not a big precision-mesh-fitting operation.\
      \ Too many anti-portals start to outweigh the benefits of themselves as well,\
      \ don't go dropping them in every little item just in case someone crouches\
      \ behind it.\n\nNaming areas can be done in Zone Infos, or a volume can be dragged\
      \ over an area that does nothing but change the location name.\n\nI don't know\
      \ why anyone would claim APVs don't work in multiplayer, they're a key factor\
      \ in getting maps running fast. They do.\n\nFog does occlude polys beyond it,\
      \ yes. Unless a material specifically states it's double sided, the engine doesn't\
      \ draw the backs of polys. It's still a good idea to delete polys you won't\
      \ see, because there's still overhead with those polys as the engine runs around\
      \ talking to the vid card trying to decide wether it needs to draw them or not.\n\
      \nLevel polys vary a great deal, it's just one of many aspects you keep in mind.\
      \ Overdraw from loads of particles have a big hit (learn to make efficient emitters!),\
      \ some materials slow it, etc. But if you're just looking for a ballpark...\
      \ 20K to 45K polys in view, onscreen, is pretty reasonable. As said before though,\
      \ it varies widely. You can find cases where a test level pushes 600K polys\
      \ at a steady 50 FPS, and you can find cases with loads of materials and overdraw\
      \ and gameplay issues that runs 12K polys at 15FPS.\n\nLuckily there are many\
      \ tools in game that let you pull up stats and see exactly where your framerate\
      \ is going as you run around a level, it's pretty easy to spot problem areas.\n\

      \ Polycount Message Board]\n\nAnd heres some more fromthe same thread.  Lee\
      \ Perry is one patient guy.\n\n{{innerbox| \"The way it works is this... if\
      \ you're looking through an anti-portal and you see a little corner of a wall\
      \ mesh sticking out behind it, the whole wall mesh gets drawn. If you move so\
      \ as the whole thing is out of view, obscured by the volume, the whole mesh\
      \ isn't drawn. So making a complicated volume for this use will generally not\
      \ make it work better, you're always going to be moving around and seeing things\
      \ around corners. It's best to use the simplest shape to get the job done.\"\
      \n\n}}\n\n==Static Meshes and Collision ==\n\nHere's some more fascinating information\
      \ taken from the UT Modelling thread over at polycount (Props to Lee Perry again\
      \ :)).\n\n{{innerbox| \"Collision for static meshes is specified in the editor.\
      \ Bullets and line-trace effects will default to per-polygon no-fuss collision.\
      \ Player collision will too, but it's a good idea to make a simplified version\
      \ in editor to reduce this, it gets expensive when you've got 16 people running\
      \ around your area. That's an easy task, BTW, even though it sounds like a drag,\
      \ Karma will benefit from that step anyway.\n\n Karma collision *CAN* use per-poly\
      \ collision, but it gets expensive quick. As with player collision, it's best\
      \ to bring in your wall, build a relatively simplified BSP surface around it,\
      \ and designate that as that object's collision. You only have to do that once.\
      \ As you do that, every instance of that wall mesh throughout the level gains\
      \ that same collision.\"\n\n Also, if that's not something you're jazzed about,\
      \ or you've got something that should really just be a cylinder or a box, in\
      \ the little mesh browser you can create a collision mesh with like 2 clicks.\
      \ They're called DOPs, and essentially you tell it which of the simple shapes\
      \ you want and it shrink wraps that primative to your object. It's very fast,\
      \ very user friendly, and it speeds up player and karma collision calculation\
      \ VASTLY. BSP shells generally are only resorted to if a DOP shape isn't really\
      \ appropriate.\n\n By using these two collision techniques, there's really very\
      \ few places you need to make any kind of blocking volumes.\"\n\n}}\n\n==Related\

      ----\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' I've been thinking about this whole prefab thing\
      \ and it occurs to me that in order to make effective use of the prefabs you\
      \ will need to make your BSP/geometry corridors wider than you would expect.\
      \  Otherwise when you add your \"prefab wall\" the interior space within your\
      \ corridor (or room) will be smaller than anticipated.  Some questions that\
      \ could do with answering around this are:\n* Do prefabs have a front and back\
      \ (a side from which they are not visible)?  It would seem a sensible.\n* Should\
      \ prefabs be algined with world geometry, or, do they need to sit slightly in\
      \ front of the BSP'd wall (like in UT when you have 2 add brushes in the same\
      \ place you see texture tears).\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' You certainly ''can'' make\
      \ prefabs that don't have a back side, and to achieve a 3D effect, they'll have\
      \ to sit a bit in front of a wall.\n\n'''Aphex:''' I presume meshes are treated\
      \ the same way as our old friends semi-solids (though probably without the bsp\
      \ errors ;) so you dont need to align them with anything, and they are separate\
      \ from the BSP.\n\n----\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' I pity the poor bugger that winds\
      \ up refactoring all this information.  I'd have a go but it scares me.\n\n\
      '''Flashman:''' Well sed Ent m8 :) btw: i'm currently making architecture that\
      \ has no backfacing polys where I can guarantee there will be a wall/floor etc.\
      \ It's just a matter of preference & performance :) apart from probs with texture\
