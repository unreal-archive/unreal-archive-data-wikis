      <p>The first step obviously is to specify the new gametype's rules:</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>The gametype will use CTF maps.</li>\n<li>Each team starts in its base.\
      \ (the base with the flag of the same color)</li>\n<li>Players can pick up and\
      \ carry their team's flag.</li>\n<li>Touching the enemy flag sends it back to\
      \ its base.</li>\n<li>Points are scored by a player who touches the enemy flag\
      \ at its base while holding his/her team's flag.</li>\n<li>The Translocator\
      \ is enabled by default, but if a player translocates while carrying the flag\
      \ causes him/her to drop the flag.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll examine the relevant\
      \ UScript classes now, before I start scripting at all. This will allow me to\
      \ think up a possible class tree for the mod. (Which classes need to be subclassed\
      \ at all and which classes can I extend from?)</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The mod might be more difficult\
      \ than I though in the first place. There are lots of classes for CTF and I'm\
      \ sure most of them need to be subclassed.</p>\n<p>Some Info subclasses:</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>GameInfo &gt;&gt; UnrealMPGameInfo &gt;&gt; DeathMatch &gt;&gt; TeamGame\
      \ &gt;&gt; CTFGame &gt;&gt; xCTFGame&#160;</dt>\n<dd>CTFGame obviously is the\
      \ base class for CTF gametypes and xCTFGame is the gametype used in UT 2003.\
      \ I'm not yet sure which of them should be subclassed.</dd>\n<dt>TeamAI &gt;&gt;\
      \ CTFTeamAI</dt>\n<dt>ReplicationInfo &gt;&gt; SquadAI &gt;&gt; CTFSquadAI&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>I don't know, what exactly these are used for, but they seem to handle the\
      \ bot AI. Need to look into those classes.</dd>\n<dt>LocalMessage &gt;&gt; CTFHUDMessage</dt>\n\
      <dt>LocalMessage &gt;&gt; CriticalEventPlus &gt;&gt; CTFMessage&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>The message classes. CTFMessage is ok, but CTFHUDMessage needs to be subclassed.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<p>Other <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\">Actor</a> classes:</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>Decoration &gt;&gt; GameObject &gt;&gt; CTFFlag&#160;</dt>\n<dd>The\

      \ &gt;&gt; JumpSpot &gt;&gt; GameObjectives &gt;&gt; CTFBase&#160;</dt>\n<dd>The\
      \ flag base. I can't replace it because it's bNoDelete=True, but I'm sure I\
      \ can handle all the important stuff from the flags. It's not bStatic, so I\
      \ might be able to change the FlagType to my own CTFFlag subclass before the\
      \ flags are spawned.</dd>\n<dt>HUD &gt;&gt; HudBase &gt;&gt; HudBDeathMatch\
      \ &gt;&gt; HudBTeamDeathMatch &gt;&gt; HudBCaptureTheFlag&#160;</dt>\n<dd>The\

      <p>First I'm going to change what happens when a player touches a flag and how\
      \ scored are awarded, i.e. which flag must be carried by whom. The ReversedCTFFlag\

      \ character effectively switches around the teams from the flag's view. Now\
      \ the blue flag can only be picked up by the blue team and will be returned\
      \ to its (blue) base by the red team.</p>\n<p>The scoring required a bit more\

    text: "==[[Legacy:Mod Ideas/Reversed CTF|Reversed CTF]]==\n\n''This mod started\
      \ out quite nicely, but then came to halt due to a lack of interest in messing\
      \ with bot AI and the existance of other, more interesting projects.''\n\nStatus\
      \ of this project: Canceled. You can get the unfinished but basically working\
      \ mod without bot support from [http://www.koehler-homepage.de/Wormbo/spareparts.html\
      \ my spare parts page].\n\n===How Do I Start?===\n\nI think this mod should\
      \ be quite simple to do since it's only a small change. (I'll see about that\
      \ after understanding the CTF code.)\n\n====The Rules====\n\nThe first step\
      \ obviously is to specify the new gametype's rules:\n* The gametype will use\
      \ CTF maps.\n* Each team starts in its base. (the base with the flag of the\
      \ same color)\n* Players can pick up and carry their team's flag.\n* Touching\
      \ the enemy flag sends it back to its base.\n* Points are scored by a player\
      \ who touches the enemy flag at its base while holding his/her team's flag.\n\
      * The Translocator is enabled by default, but if a player translocates while\
      \ carrying the flag causes him/her to drop the flag.\n\nI'll examine the relevant\
      \ UScript classes now, before I start scripting at all. This will allow me to\
      \ think up a possible class tree for the mod. (Which classes need to be subclassed\
      \ at all and which classes can I extend from?)\n\n====A Look At Existing Classes====\n\
      \nThe mod might be more difficult than I though in the first place. There are\
      \ lots of classes for CTF and I'm sure most of them need to be subclassed.\n\
      \nSome Info subclasses:\n; GameInfo >> UnrealMPGameInfo >> DeathMatch >> TeamGame\
      \ >> CTFGame >> xCTFGame : CTFGame obviously is the base class for CTF gametypes\
      \ and xCTFGame is the gametype used in UT 2003. I'm not yet sure which of them\
      \ should be subclassed.\n; TeamAI >> CTFTeamAI\n; ReplicationInfo >> SquadAI\
      \ >> CTFSquadAI : I don't know, what exactly these are used for, but they seem\
      \ to handle the bot AI. Need to look into those classes.\n; LocalMessage >>\
      \ CTFHUDMessage\n; LocalMessage >> CriticalEventPlus >> CTFMessage : The message\
      \ classes. CTFMessage is ok, but CTFHUDMessage needs to be subclassed.\n\nOther\
      \ [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]] classes:\n; Decoration >> GameObject >> CTFFlag : The\
      \ flag itself. Needs to be subclassed.\n; NavigationPoint >> JumpDest >> JumpSpot\
      \ >> GameObjectives >> CTFBase : The flag base. I can't replace it because it's\
      \ bNoDelete=True, but I'm sure I can handle all the important stuff from the\
      \ flags. It's not bStatic, so I might be able to change the FlagType to my own\
      \ CTFFlag subclass before the flags are spawned.\n; HUD >> HudBase >> HudBDeathMatch\
      \ >> HudBTeamDeathMatch >> HudBCaptureTheFlag : The HUD class. I'm not sure\
      \ whether I need to subclass it.\n\n===Starting The Real Work===\n\n====Easy\
      \ Start====\n\nI decided to subclass xCTFGame and not CTFGame and also found\
      \ out that I need to subclass HudBCaptureTheFlag to replace the CTFHUDMessage\
      \ with my own class.\n\nCurrently I have these:\n; ReversedCTFGame (extends\
      \ xCTFGame) : The [[Legacy:GameInfo|GameInfo]] class. Currently only replaces\
      \ the HUD.\n; HudReversedCTF (extends HudBCaptureTheFlag) : The HUD class. Currently\
      \ only replaces the CTFHUDMessage.\n; ReversedCTFHUDMessage (extends CTFHUDMessage)\
      \ : Displays the warn messages when a player of the enemy team or the local\
      \ player has the flag.\n; ReversedCTF.int : Adds the new game type to the list\
      \ of game types.\n\nUp to this point I didn't have to do any real coding work:\
      \ The GameInfo and the message class only change some default properties and\
      \ the HUD class has two small changes in its <tt>Timer</tt> function. Tomorrow\
      \ I'll start with the real work, i.e. the changes in the CTFFlag and CTFGame\
      \ code to allow the flag's team to pick it up, score points, etc.\n\n====Helpful\
      \ Tools====\n\nBefore continuing with the actual coding work I set up a batch\
      \ file for recompiling the package:\n\n'''UCCMakeReversedCTF.bat'''\n\n<pre>\n\
      @echo off\nd:\ncd\\ut2003\\system\n:start\ndel reversedctf.u\nucc make\necho.\n\
      pause\ngoto start\n</pre>\n\nThis little script automatically deletes ReversedCTF.u\
      \ and runs UCC Make to recompile it. It might be even better if I creaded a\
      \ special INI file for UCC to use, but with only one project this almost seems\
      \ too much work...\n\nHmm, gotta get used to the new look of the Make commandlet.\
      \ :)\n\n:'''Mychaeel:''' Note to self:  I ''need'' to get (a new version of)\
      \ UMake out to the public.\n\n====Gameplay and Scoring====\n\nFirst I'm going\
      \ to change what happens when a player touches a flag and how scored are awarded,\
      \ i.e. which flag must be carried by whom. The ReversedCTFFlag script only contains\
      \ this function:\n\n<uscript>\nfunction bool SameTeam(Controller c)\n{\n   \
      \ if (c == None || c.PlayerReplicationInfo.Team == Team) // changed from \"\
      != Team\"\n        return false;\n\n    return true;\n}\n</uscript>\n\nThis\
      \ tiny change of a single character effectively switches around the teams from\
      \ the flag's view. Now the blue flag can only be picked up by the blue team\
      \ and will be returned to its (blue) base by the red team.\n\nThe scoring required\
      \ a bit more work. Exactly two changes in the ScoreFlag function, to be precice:\
      \ :rolleyes:\n\n<uscript>\nfunction ScoreFlag(Controller Scorer, CTFFlag theFlag)\n\
      {\n\tlocal float Dist,oppDist;\n\tlocal int i;\n\tlocal float ppp,numtouch;\n\
      \tlocal vector FlagLoc;\n\n\tif ( Scorer.PlayerReplicationInfo.Team != theFlag.Team\
      \ ) {\t// was \"== theFlag.Team\"\n\t\tScorer.AwardAdrenaline(ADR_Return);\n\
      \t\tFlagLoc = TheFlag.Position().Location;\n\t\tDist = vsize(FlagLoc - TheFlag.HomeBase.Location);\n\
      \t\t\n\t\tif ( TheFlag.TeamNum != 0 )\t// was \"== 0\"\n\t\t\toppDist = vsize(FlagLoc\
      \ - Teams[1].HomeBase.Location);\n\t\telse\n  \t\t\toppDist = vsize(FlagLoc\
      \ - Teams[0].HomeBase.Location); \n...\n</uscript>\n\nThe gametype almost works\
      \ as intended and could even be played online already. The only problem now\
      \ is the AI: The bots gather around their team's flag carrier and keep saying\
      \ \"enemy flag carrier is here\" while the bot that has the flag doesn't move\
      \ at all.\n\nThis will be the next problem to solve.\n\n====AI &rarr; Explaining\
      \ The Rules To The Bots====\n\nAI is the most difficult part in creating a new\
      \ gametype. (not counting tweaking and bug-fixing)\n\nLuckily in [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]]\
      \ gametype-specific bot AI is stored in seperate classes: SquadAI and (for team\
      \ games) TeamAI.\n\nBut first:\n\n=====The First Major Bug! :(=====\n\nThe flags\
      \ are invisible while they are not at their bases.\n\nIt turned out that my\
      \ class analysis was incomplete, the CTFFlag class has some subclasses:\n\n\
      '''CTFFlag >> xBlueFlag/xRedFlag'''\n\nI copied the xRedFlag and xBlueFlag classes\
      \ and made them subclasses of my ReversedCTFFlag class.\n\n=====Back To AI=====\n\
      \nI need to create completely new code for at least one of the larger CTFSquadAI\
      \ functions. It might take some time to get the basic structure and I will do\
      \ that on paper first.\n\n=====Months pass...=====\n\nMeanwhile I switched from\
      \ batch file compiling to [[Legacy:UMake|UMake]] and finished the Mercury Missile\
      \ InstaGib mutator but instead of continuing with Reversed CTF I started playing\
      \ Diablo 2 again &ndash; bad thing. :P\n\nReversed CTF is now in the \"Overload\
      \ v100 state\", i.e. it works online perfectly and you could try to play it\
      \ offline with bots, but don't expect too much from them. They just grab the\
      \ flag and run towards the enemy base.\n\n----\n\n==Comments ==\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ Jolly good, it might be finished by the time I get back on-line.\n\n'''Wormbo:'''\
      \ I didn't look at the details of the AI classes, but I guess in this case it\
      \ will be mostly swapping EnemyFlag and FriendlyFlag or the teams.\n\n'''Wormbo:'''\
      \ Urgh, I take back everything I said. This gametype requires a completely different\
      \ strategy, since you have to prevent the enemies from breaking into '''your'''\
      \ base instead of reaching their base after escaping from yours. I need to completely\
      \ rewrite that part of the SquadAI class. Also I just noticed, why the flags\
      \ are invisible when they are carried or otherwise not at their base: CTFFlag\
      \ has two subclasses xRedFlag and xBlueFlag. :/\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Oh well, I'll\
      \ have to take a break from this mod. Not because I needed it, but because I\
      \ forgot to copy it to my notebook. :/ Actual coding work will be delayed till\
      \ Monday, but in the meantime I could try to create the main structure for the\
      \ bot behavior.\n\n'''Aphelion:'''  Thought I'd wish you luck...  Looks like\
      \ you're going well... \n\n'''Nuclear Fuzz Grunge:''' This is an interesting\
      \ exploratory type of tutorial. Perfect for Retro characters. Excellent. Complete\
      \ clarity. An Exposition of Your Thinking Process. Thanks.\n\n:Weeks pass...\n\
      \n'''Wormbo:''' I should really continue this sometimes... o_O\n\n'''Trystan:'''\
      \ hehehe.  I've said that myself '''so''' many times. =)\n:More week pass...\n\
      \n'''GRAF!K:''' Are you going to continue this?\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Yes, I planned\
      \ to... sometimes at least... :rolleyes:\n:Even more weeks (or better: months)\
      \ pass...\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Enough is enough. This project got stuck at the bot\
      \ AI and I hereby officially cancel development. You can get the mod and its\
      \ source code at [http://www.koehler-homepage.de/Wormbo/spareparts.html my spare\
      \ parts page]. If you want you can continue it, the only thing really missing\
      \ is the bot AI. Reversed CTF itself is in \"Overload v100 state\", i.e. it\
      \ works online without any problems as long as no bots are involved.\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
