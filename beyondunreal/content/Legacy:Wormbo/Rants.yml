      \ the idea that somebody gets paid for annoying innocent players with mutators\

      \ It's a bug exploit where you throw your weapon while running forwards to skip\
      \ the putdown animation when switching weapons. You immediately pick up the\
      \ weapon again and since players using this have turned off auto-switching they\
      \ switch weapons a lot faster than normal. This works better in UT than in UT2003\
      \ since weaponswitching is already quite fast in UT2003. The mutator I coded\
      \ simply prevents picking up an item that moves away from the player.</p>\n\

      \ thought it couldn't get worse, but then you get to see the UT 2003 UnrealScript\
      \ source code. You want a proof? Here you are:</p>\n<p>The HUD mutators are\
      \ dead, same with the message mutators. Damage mutators are still kind of alive,\
      \ but seriously injured. The GameRules's NetDamage (why <b>Net</b>Damage?) function\
      \ only allows to change the amount of damage, the HitLocation and Momentum can't\
      \ be changed anymore.&#160;:/</p>\n<p>The UDamage itself doesn't really exist\
      \ as an object anymore, instead it's spread across several classes like UDamageCharger\
      \ (the pickup base), UDamagePack (the actual pickup) and UDamageTimer (an Info\
      \ subclass that stops the UDamage effect after some time). Wait... no Inventory\
      \ class? Nope, the UDamage's real magic now resides in the xPawn class. All\
      \ features (the special weapon texture, the firing sound and even the doubled\
      \ damage) are hardcoded in either Pawn or xPawn. My opinion about that is best\
      \ expressed with a quote from the Pawn class's TakeDamage code:</p>\n<div dir=\"\
      ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\"\
      >\n<pre class=\"de1\">    <span class=\"kw2\">if</span> <span class=\"br0\"\

      sy0\">*=</span> <span class=\"nu0\">2</span>;</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Ok, so\
      \ the UDamage code sucks, but what's up with the other thing that powers up\
      \ the damage someone does → the berserk combo? Well, it's also hardcoded, but\
      \ in the Weapon and WeaponFire classes. No Pawn or xPawn code involved. You\
      \ should think they'd create those two effects by using a common method to change\
      \ the weapon's damage, but obviously you can't have everything... o_O</p>\n\
      <p>But maybe you can – if you do it yourself. There's a DamageAtten property\
      \ in the WeaponFire class which is used as a damage multiplier for hit-scan\
      \ and projectile weapons. It's set to 1.0 and doesn't seem to get changed, but\
      \ the damage is always multiplied by it.</p>\n<p>The UDamage now being completely\
      \ handled by pawn code caused another feature to be removed: No more weapon\
      \ affectors. In UT the TournamentWeapon class's Affector property could point\
      \ to a TournamentPickup which got a FireEffect call every time the weapon was\
      \ fired. That's how the UDamage and Relic of Strength knew when to play their\
      \ additional firing sounds. With my EnhancedItems package it was even possible\
      \ to create a whole list of affectors for a weapon, at least as long as only\
      \ PickupPlus items tried to add themselves to that list. With an EnhancedWeapon\
      \ as affected weapon the PickupPlus affectors even had the opportunity to draw\

      \ draw the UDamage, shield belt, rapid fire and cloak effects and they look\
      \ pretty good.&#160;:) In UT 2003 it's now possible to use an overlay material\
      \ for any kind of actor. That's how the cool UDamage effect in is done there.</p>\n\
      <p>Another good thing in UT 2003 are the damage types. Yes, that old idea from\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Sometimes game developers have the bad habit of creating\
      \ hacks to make features compatible to previous versions of a game or mod. Usually\
      \ these hacks tend to show ugly side-effects later.</p>\n<p>The most popular\
      \ and most annoying example are the Relic mutators in UT Bonuspack 1. The <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Mutator\" title=\"Legacy:Mutator\">Mutator</a> class in UT\
      \ v400 didn't have the NextHUDMutator property, so the developers decided to\
      \ create the <a href=\"/Legacy:HUDMutator\" title=\"Legacy:HUDMutator\">HUDMutator</a>\
      \ class instead of telling the people that the Relics need a newer version of\
      \ UT. Now the NextHUDMutator property has been added to the Mutator class, but\
      \ the HUDMutators don't use it. This is everything else but compatibility. Recently\
      \ I wrote a <a href=\"/Legacy:Relics_Patch\" title=\"Legacy:Relics Patch\">Relics\
      \ Patch</a> which subclasses the RelicHUDMutator to stop it from breaking the\
      \ HUD mutator list – works great, but unfortunately it doesn't stop people from\
      \ doing bad things:</p>\n<p>Chaos UT – a great mod. It was good enough to be\
      \ bundled with UT's Game Of The Year Edition. Chaotic Dreams found a way to\
      \ make their mod compatible with the Relic mutators: They created two versions\
      \ if their HUD mutator, one subclassed from Mutator using the NextHUDMutator\
      \ property and one subclassed from RelicHUDMutator which uses the HUDMutator's\
      \ NextRHUDMutator property. The user can switch between the two mutators by\
      \ enabling or disabling a checkbox in the mod's config window. Unfortunately,\
      \ none of the original coders still works on the mod and so the new coders had\
      \ to dig through the code trying to understand, what it does and why it was\
      \ coded that way. They didn't see why the relic-incompatible HUD mutator had\
      \ to be in there and simply removed the \"Using Relics\" option. Everything\
      \ worked fine for them, there aren't so many HUD mutators out there. I talked\
      \ to the Chaos UT team about the HUD mutator thing and <a href=\"/Legacy:Jb\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Jb\">Jb</a> promised to re-enable that option. I also told\
      \ him about the Relic HUD Patch I wrote and it will be in the next Chaos UT\
      \ version. (Hey!&#160;:) ) But now Chaos UT might have to face a new problem:</p>\n\
      <p>Not long ago a new mod team released a \"Bonus Pack\" for UT. The \"technoloG\
      \ Bonus Pack\" is a simple collection of mutators and menu enhancements from\
      \ a team which \"represents professional-quality work coupled with innovations\
      \ and enhancements to the gameplay experience.\" (quoted from the technoloG\
      \ website)</p>\n<p>I have to admit the new Relics and the SpellUNREAL mutator\
      \ are fun, but both use the <a href=\"/Legacy:HUDMutator\" title=\"Legacy:HUDMutator\"\
      >HUDMutator</a> class. The new relics use the original relic's HUD mutator,\
      \ so it <i>might</i> be possible that the <a href=\"/Legacy:Relics_Patch\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Relics Patch\">Relics Patch</a> is able to make the new relics compatible\
      \ to other HUD mutators, but the SpellUNREAL mutator uses its own subclass of\
      \ HUDMutator – the patch won't be able to fix that.</p>\n<p>Maybe technoloG\
      \ should concider updating their bonus pack. The UMOD installer doesn't work\
      \ with the GOTY edition of UT because it requires Bonuspack 1 to be installed.\
      \ UT GOTYE includes BP1, the Inoxx Map Pack and the Digital Extremes Pack –\
      \ no need to reinstall them or mess around with Manifest.ini just for installing\
      \ the technoloG bonus pack. Maybe they would also be willing to include the\
      \ Relic HUD Patch, make their new relics use the patched relic HUD and get that\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:HUDMutator\" title=\"Legacy:HUDMutator\">HUDMutator</a>\
      \ out of SpellUNREAL. Maybe.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage:\

      '''Wormbo:''' It's a bug exploit where you throw your weapon while running forwards\
      \ to skip the putdown animation when switching weapons. You immediately pick\
      \ up the weapon again and since players using this have turned off auto-switching\
      \ they switch weapons a lot faster than normal. This works better in UT than\
      \ in UT2003 since weaponswitching is already quite fast in UT2003. The mutator\

      \ You release a beta version of your mod, map or some other kind or custom content\
      \ for a game and ask people to give you some feedback. You can be lucky and\
      \ \"only\" receive useless \"wow this rocks\" or \"bah this sucks\" responses\
      \ or you can be even more lucky and really receive useful feedback, but usually\
      \ it's either silence or useless responses.\n\n\"Ok\", you think, \"maybe it's\
      \ not that bad after all, I'll just release it.\" &ndash; Be prepared for the\
      \ flames and whinings, because now the real \"feedback\" will get back to you.\n\
      * \"Gah, this piece of crap lags terribly!\"\n* \"This thing makes my server\
      \ crash every time now!\"\n* \"Hey, it kicks everyone off my server! HEEEELLLPPPPPP!!!!!!!1111one\"\
      \n\nYou can't make your stuff completely idiot-proof, there'll always be an\
      \ even greater idiot than you expected. Usually it's just a misconfiguration\
      \ of their server, in the best case they just have a typo in the neccessary\
      \ ServerPackages line. The worst case-scenario however, is the ignorant server\
      \ admin newbie who doesn't really know how to configure a server and who doesn't\
      \ even know about the log file which contains very useful information about\
      \ any kind of problems occuring while the server is up. This includes important\
      \ script warnings of the mods running and large amounts of standard [[Legacy:Log\

      \ sure like to complain when you *do* release it about any problems or shortcomings.\
      \  My favorite responses include \"where are teh custom models\" and \"this\
      \ will be great whenever you're done\".\n\nUnfortunately, with the small size\
      \ of people willing to test things - you really have to take things with a grain\
      \ of salt and use your own judgement. By about the second round of testing,\
      \ at least one person had felt that each of the three teams in Riftwar was \"\

      \ Features ==\n\nYou thought it couldn't get worse, but then you get to see\
      \ the UT 2003 UnrealScript source code. You want a proof? Here you are:\n\n\
      The HUD mutators are dead, same with the message mutators. Damage mutators are\
      \ still kind of alive, but seriously injured. The GameRules's NetDamage (why\
      \ '''Net'''Damage?) function only allows to change the amount of damage, the\
      \ HitLocation and Momentum can't be changed anymore. :/\n\nThe UDamage itself\
      \ doesn't really exist as an object anymore, instead it's spread across several\
      \ classes like UDamageCharger (the pickup base), UDamagePack (the actual pickup)\
      \ and UDamageTimer (an Info subclass that stops the UDamage effect after some\
      \ time). Wait... no Inventory class? Nope, the UDamage's real magic now resides\
      \ in the xPawn class. All features (the special weapon texture, the firing sound\
      \ and even the doubled damage) are hardcoded in either Pawn or xPawn. My opinion\
      \ about that is best expressed with a quote from the Pawn class's TakeDamage\
      \ code:\n\n<uscript>\n    if ( (InstigatedBy != None) && InstigatedBy.HasUDamage()\
      \ ) // FIXME THIS SUCKS\n        Damage *= 2;\n</uscript>\n\nOk, so the UDamage\
      \ code sucks, but what's up with the other thing that powers up the damage someone\
      \ does &rarr; the berserk combo? Well, it's also hardcoded, but in the Weapon\
      \ and WeaponFire classes. No Pawn or xPawn code involved. You should think they'd\
      \ create those two effects by using a common method to change the weapon's damage,\
      \ but obviously you can't have everything... o_O\n\nBut maybe you can &ndash;\
      \ if you do it yourself. There's a DamageAtten property in the WeaponFire class\
      \ which is used as a damage multiplier for hit-scan and projectile weapons.\
      \ It's set to 1.0 and doesn't seem to get changed, but the damage is always\
      \ multiplied by it.\n\nThe UDamage now being completely handled by pawn code\
      \ caused another feature to be removed: No more weapon affectors. In UT the\
      \ TournamentWeapon class's Affector property could point to a TournamentPickup\
      \ which got a FireEffect call every time the weapon was fired. That's how the\
      \ UDamage and Relic of Strength knew when to play their additional firing sounds.\
      \ With my EnhancedItems package it was even possible to create a whole list\
      \ of affectors for a weapon, at least as long as only PickupPlus items tried\
      \ to add themselves to that list. With an EnhancedWeapon as affected weapon\
      \ the PickupPlus affectors even had the opportunity to draw an effect during\
      \ the weapon's RenderOverlays. I used this in Rockets UT to draw the UDamage,\
      \ shield belt, rapid fire and cloak effects and they look pretty good. :) In\
      \  UT 2003 it's now possible to use an overlay material for any kind of actor.\
      \ That's how the cool UDamage effect in is done there.\n\nAnother good thing\
      \ in UT 2003 are the damage types. Yes, that old idea from Unreal was picked\
      \ up again, this time it even worked. :o But guess what: That's another feature\
      \ I hacked into UT for the use with Rockets UT and other mods.\n\nWildcardBase\
      \ &ndash; it randomly spawns one of up to eight TournamentPickup classes. [[Legacy:EnhancedItems|MultiPickupPlus]]\
      \ anyone? The MPP for UT was way more powerful. It allowed up to 20 Inventory\
      \ classes which are not limited to powerups, also weapons, ammo and armor items\
      \ could be spawned. Another advantage of the MPP was its ability to select items\
      \ from the list based on a RejectChance, i.e. spawning certain items was more\
      \ likely than spawning others.\n\n===Comments ===\n\n'''Tahngarth:''' I thought\
      \ the Beserk combo increased your weapons' fire rates, not their damage...\n\
      \n'''Wormbo:''' Berserk increases both firing rate and damage by 33%. The actual\
      \ values are hardcoded in every single [[Legacy:WeaponFire|WeaponFire]] class\
      \ like here for the MinigunFire class:<uscript>\nfunction StartBerserk()\n{\n\
      \    DamageMin = default.DamageMin * 1.33;\n    DamageMax = default.DamageMax\
      \ * 1.33;\n}\n\nfunction StopBerserk()\n{\n    DamageMin = default.DamageMin;\n\
      \    DamageMax = default.DamageMax;\n}\n</uscript>\n\n'''Mysterial:''' Only\
      \ the Assault Rifle and Minigun get damage increases, and it's instead of giving\
      \ those two weapons a faster firing rate, not in addition to it. I suspect this\
      \ is because of lockdown.\n\n----\n\n'''Githianki:''' Do you think these issues\
      \ are a result of design sloppiness or somehow tied to anticheating measures?\
      \ Just curious. Is it truly haphazard or is there some logic there?  Knowing\
      \ the path this game took to completion (suddenly developed, first for one platform\
      \ then another, etc.) I would hazard the former.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I have no\
      \ idea. Like I stated above, this page is just a place for me to complain about\
      \ stuff. :)\n\n'''MadNad:''' Funny, cuz I could swear firerates were faster,\
      \ but I never saw anything but the damage being multiplied by bezerk.  I wish\
      \ I could see how this is done.  I tried having a configurable max hold time\
      \ for a rocket launcher, but the firerates by the client would not use the value\
      \ by the servers configurable variable, but would use whatever they were configured\
      \ to.  So the fire anims were out of sync.  The actual rates worked just fine,\
      \ just not the animation.  I would love to hear any thoughts you have on making\
      \ this happen, but with the firerates role set to none, I kinda gave up on it.\n\
      \n'''Bob_The_Beheader:''' Hmmm...in the middle of a firefight, it is a wee bit\
      \ difficult to tell if the damage has been increased by 33%. Not as hard as\
      \ it would be if this were Counter-strike, but still, 33% won't look nearly\
      \ the same as UDamage's 2x boost.\n\n----\n\n==Crappy Hacks ==\n\nSometimes\
      \ game developers have the bad habit of creating hacks to make features compatible\
      \ to previous versions of a game or mod. Usually these hacks tend to show ugly\
      \ side-effects later.\n\nThe most popular and most annoying example are the\
      \ Relic mutators in UT Bonuspack 1. The [[Legacy:Mutator|Mutator]] class in\
      \ UT v400 didn't have the NextHUDMutator property, so the developers decided\
      \ to create the [[Legacy:HUDMutator|HUDMutator]] class instead of telling the\
      \ people that the Relics need a newer version of UT. Now the NextHUDMutator\
      \ property has been added to the Mutator class, but the HUDMutators don't use\
      \ it. This is everything else but compatibility. Recently I wrote a [[Legacy:Relics\
      \ Patch|Relics Patch]] which subclasses the RelicHUDMutator to stop it from\
      \ breaking the HUD mutator list &ndash; works great, but unfortunately it doesn't\
      \ stop people from doing bad things:\n\nChaos UT &ndash; a great mod. It was\
      \ good enough to be bundled with UT's Game Of The Year Edition. Chaotic Dreams\
      \ found a way to make their mod compatible with the Relic mutators: They created\
      \ two versions if their HUD mutator, one subclassed from Mutator using the NextHUDMutator\
      \ property and one subclassed from RelicHUDMutator which uses the HUDMutator's\
      \ NextRHUDMutator property. The user can switch between the two mutators by\
      \ enabling or disabling a checkbox in the mod's config window. Unfortunately,\
      \ none of the original coders still works on the mod and so the new coders had\
      \ to dig through the code trying to understand, what it does and why it was\
      \ coded that way. They didn't see why the relic-incompatible HUD mutator had\
      \ to be in there and simply removed the \"Using Relics\" option. Everything\
      \ worked fine for them, there aren't so many HUD mutators out there. I talked\
      \ to the Chaos UT team about the HUD mutator thing and [[Legacy:Jb|Jb]] promised\
      \ to re-enable that option. I also told him about the Relic HUD Patch I wrote\
      \ and it will be in the next Chaos UT version. (Hey! :) ) But now Chaos UT might\
      \ have to face a new problem:\n\nNot long ago a new mod team released a \"Bonus\
      \ Pack\" for UT. The \"technoloG Bonus Pack\" is a simple collection of mutators\
      \ and menu enhancements from a team which \"represents professional-quality\
      \ work coupled with innovations and enhancements to the gameplay experience.\"\
      \ (quoted from the technoloG website)\n\nI have to admit the new Relics and\
      \ the SpellUNREAL mutator are fun, but both use the [[Legacy:HUDMutator|HUDMutator]]\
      \ class. The new relics use the original relic's HUD mutator, so it ''might''\
      \ be possible that the [[Legacy:Relics Patch|Relics Patch]] is able to make\
      \ the new relics compatible to other HUD mutators, but the SpellUNREAL mutator\
      \ uses its own subclass of HUDMutator &ndash; the patch won't be able to fix\
      \ that.\n\nMaybe technoloG should concider updating their bonus pack. The UMOD\
      \ installer doesn't work with the GOTY edition of UT because it requires Bonuspack\
      \ 1 to be installed. UT GOTYE includes BP1, the Inoxx Map Pack and the Digital\
      \ Extremes Pack &ndash; no need to reinstall them or mess around with Manifest.ini\
      \ just for installing the technoloG bonus pack. Maybe they would also be willing\
      \ to include the Relic HUD Patch, make their new relics use the patched relic\
      \ HUD and get that [[Legacy:HUDMutator|HUDMutator]] out of SpellUNREAL. Maybe.\n\
