      \ Wormbo .. You planning on doing a version of your <i>Arena</i> mutator for\

      \ you could do with it as there are sooo many weapons.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ No, go ahead. I'm still wondering whether I should make a UT2k3 version, though...</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Thanks&#160;:). I thought you already had a 2K3 version.\
      \ I thought your version of the Arena mod allowed you to select mutliple weapons\
      \ to appear in the map - in which case you might as well. There again, I don't\
      \ play UT2k3 so don't let my opinion sway you any.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
