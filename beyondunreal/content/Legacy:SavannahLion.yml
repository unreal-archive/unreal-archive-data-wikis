      <p>Pimping is not my normal thing. However, the main Sovereign guy has laid\
      \ down a few <strike>not so</strike> subtle hints that he wants his members\
      \ to pimp the mod more. To be frank, I don't think Wiki is really the place\
      \ for that. In other words, I wouldn't want to see everyone else pimping their\
      \ mods all over Wiki when I'm trying to find answers. Since I don't really expect\
      \ anyone to actually find any answers on this little page and this seems to\
      \ be the place for personal... stuff, I guess a few links wouldn't hurt.</p>\n\
