  title: "Legacy:Distance Fog"
  text:
    text: "<p>Distance <a href=\"/Legacy:Fog\" title=\"Legacy:Fog\">Fog</a> is sometimes\
      \ called \"true fog.\" Distance fog tints the screen as with <a href=\"/Legacy:View_Fog\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:View Fog\">view fog</a>, but the degree of tinting is determined\
      \ by the distance that a given pixel is from the camera. View fog has a uniform\
      \ color independant of the distance you are from an object. Objects further\
      \ away will apear to \"fade away\" into the distance fog. Note, however, that\
      \ the <a href=\"/Legacy:SkyBox\" title=\"Legacy:SkyBox\">SkyBox</a> is not affected\
      \ by the fog on your level, but you can add fog into the skybox as well.</p>\n\
      <p>Unlike View Fog, Distance Fog has to check a lot of distances every frame\
      \ and this can have an impact on performance. However, some types of distance\
      \ fog allow the engine to reject objects beyond a certain distance, which usually\
      \ results in a net speed boost: this distance fog may be a useful tool in <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Map_Optimization\" title=\"Legacy:Map Optimization\">Map Optimization</a>.</p>\n\
      <p>Distance fog may not show up in <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\">UnrealEd</a>, and can be tuned in-game using the <b>editactor</b>\
      \ console command to find the optimum values. Note, however, that distance fog\
      \ may not obscure the <a href=\"/Legacy:Corona\" title=\"Legacy:Corona\">coronas</a>\

      \ Note that you will have to change the file type in the load dialog to color\
      \ table otherwise PS thinks you are just looking for swatch files. Now that\

      \ title=\"Legacy:Info\">Info</a> &gt;&gt; <a href=\"/Legacy:ZoneInfo\" title=\"\
      Legacy:ZoneInfo\">ZoneInfo</a>, and set some variables. Specifically those variables\

      \ fog in this zone.</dd>\n<dt>ZoneInfo -&gt; bClearToFogColor&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Always\

      <dd>fade time when entering this zone. Only has an effect if the zone the camera\

      \ in front of the camera that the fog becomes 100% opaque.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>One\
      \ big benefit of using zone fog in your map in addition to adding atmosphere\
      \ is that it allows the engine to discard objects and entire zones if they're\
      \ beyond the DistanceFogEnd distance, which can result in a big speed boost\
      \ in some maps.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Volume_Fog\">Volume\

      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Distance_Fog?section=5\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Volume Fog\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Before we start, there's one important fact about Volume-based fog that you\
      \ should know: It doesn't occlude. If you're trying to optimize your level use\
      \ zone fog, as volume fog won't do anything for you (in fact it might make it\
      \ run a bit slower due to the extra blending, but I'm not sure about that).</p>\n\
      <p>Volume-based distance fog is very similar to to View Fog in UT2003. You must\
      \ place a PhysicsVolume to cover the area that you want the fog to affect, but\
      \ instead of setting the ViewFog variables, you will need to set four variables\
      \ under the \"VolumeFog\" group.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>bDistanceFog&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This\
      \ is a boolean variable indicating whether or not distance fog calculations\
      \ should be done. If you want to use distance fog, this must be set to true.\
      \ By default, it is set to false.</dd>\n<dt>DistanceFogColor&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This\
      \ is a color variable that specifies, simply enough, the color that you want\
      \ the fog to be. The alpha of the color will be determined by the distance that\
      \ the object being viewed is from the camera.</dd>\n<dt>DistanceFogEnd&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>This is the distance at which fog cover is absolute. Everything at this\
      \ range and beyond will be totally obscured. However, if the skybox does not\
      \ contain fog, these objects will actually be silhouetted against the sky. (Because\
      \ the object itself will be completely colored over but the sky behind it will\
      \ be unaffected.)</dd>\n<dt>DistanceFogStart&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This is the distance\
      \ at which fog calculations begin. Anything closer than this distance to the\
      \ camera will not be fogged at all.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Interestingly, if you set\
      \ DistanceFogStart to be GREATER than DistanceFogEnd, you will get <i>inverse</i>\
      \ fog. Objects will become more obscured the CLOSER you get to them.</p>\n\n\
