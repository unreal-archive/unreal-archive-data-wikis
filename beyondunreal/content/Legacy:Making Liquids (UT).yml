      <p>Making water, lava or slime couldn't be easier. It's like falling off your\
      \ bike your very first time. Yep that easy. By the time you're done with this\
      \ tutorial, you should be able to use sheets and actors to create a body of\
      \ water within your level. For the sake of simplity I shall refer to making\
      \ water in this tutorial though the process is the same as setting up anything\
      \ else like lava or slime. I'm also assuming you know the basics of addition,\
      \ subtraction and know your way around UnrealEd enough to know where buttons\
      \ are etc. If you don't, some pages that may help are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\
      /Legacy:UnrealEd_Interface\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd Interface\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\

      <ol>\n<li>In order to build water we must have a place to hold the water. <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Subtract_A_Space\" title=\"Legacy:Subtract A Space\">Subtract\
      \ a space</a> in your map: 512x1024x1024. Then subtract from the floor a cube\
      \ of about 256x256x256. You should now have something that looks like a room\
      \ with an empty swimming pool.</li>\n<li>Open the <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Browser\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Texture Browser\">texture browser</a> and pick a nice water\
      \ texture from GenFluids.utx or anyother pack that you might prefer to use.\
      \ (See <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Package_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Texture Package\
      \ (UT)\">Texture Package (UT)</a> for a complete list.)</li>\n<li>Now we need\
      \ a <a href=\"/Legacy:Sheet\" title=\"Legacy:Sheet\">sheet</a> brush for the\
      \ water surface. Make a sheet 256 x 256. (Some tutorials tell you the sheet\
      \ must be slightly bigger than the size of the pool. This is incorrect. It must\
      \ line up <i>exactly</i>, and if you are using the <a href=\"/Legacy:Grid\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Grid\">grid</a>, this is easily done. On the other hand, if\
      \ you make the sheet slightly bigger it's easier to select it in the Top orthogonal\
      \ viewport. If the water surface is a complex shape (eg you have pillars or\
      \ rocks or something) then it's easiest to overlap the sheet with solid space.)</li>\n\
      <li>click on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Add_Special\" title=\"Legacy:Add Special\"\
      >add special</a> brush button. Scroll down the prefabs to water and click OK.\
      \ You should see a green sheet now. Move the sheet to the top of the pool and\
      \ set it in place so it's a little bit lower than the top edge.<br />\nExample:\
      \ we have a pool that is 256 units deep. Set the sheet at 240, or lower if you\
      \ want. You can also set it flush at 256 mark if you'd like.</li>\n<li>What\
      \ we've done so far is create a zone which we will tell UnrealEd to treat as\
      \ water. <a href=\"/Legacy:Add_An_Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Add An Actor\">Add\
      \ an Actor</a> &gt;&gt; Info &gt;&gt; ZoneInfo &gt;&gt; <a href=\"/Legacy:WaterZone\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:WaterZone\">WaterZone</a>. (Or <a href=\"/Legacy:LavaZone\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:LavaZone\">LavaZone</a>, or <a href=\"/Legacy:SlimeZone\" title=\"\
      Legacy:SlimeZone\">SlimeZone</a> depending on what you want to create.) Make\
      \ sure is it near the bottom so there is no chance of a leak.</li>\n<li><a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Rebuild\" title=\"Legacy:Rebuild\">Rebuild</a> and go play your level.\
      \ You have lava, water, slime whatever you wanted.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The leaks basically refered to your zone not being\
      \ built properly. Switch the 3D viewport to Zone/Portal view by clicking the\
      \ icon in the viewport titlebar (#10 in the picture below).</p>\n<p>All the\
      \ geometry will now be displayed in shades of one colour. If you go below the\
      \ sheet that acts as the surface of the water, the <a href=\"/Legacy:Zone_Portal\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Zone Portal\">zone portal</a>, the color will be different.</p>\n\
      <div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_interface.viewporttitlebar.brighter.gif\"\

      \ separated by that sheet. This sheet is essentially telling UnrealEd that everything\
      \ below this sheet will have different properties (in our case water) and everything\
      \ above will be something else. For the sake of having fun delete the sheet\
      \ and rebuild. Play your level and tell me if there is a difference&#160;;)</p>\n\
