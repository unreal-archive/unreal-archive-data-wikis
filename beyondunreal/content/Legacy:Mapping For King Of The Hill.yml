      <p><b>Jb:</b> First of all thanks for fixing my Wiki blunders. Sorry I will\
      \ get the hang of it. But yes. The KOTH2 was originally coded by Gorgor. His\
      \ version used triggers but was not compatible with the bots (ie the bots did\
      \ not know how to play KOTH). The Marathon Rampancy (SP?) team also based their\
      \ version of the KOTH2 using triggers. However their version was compatible\
      \ with bots. The ChaosUT team coded their to use hill triggers and zones (as\
      \ sometimes you want to use a hill zone, other times you want a trigger). They\
      \ also used Defense points and placed these defense points inside the hill trigger/zone.\
      \ They did the so that you could place several defense points inside a hill\
      \ trigger/zone and the bot would move from defense point to defense point to\
      \ more mimic how a human might play KOTH. Finally this allowed them to handle\
      \ multiple hill. You can set the defense points fortstand tag for each hill.\
      \ Thus a bot wound wonder from hill to hill. Finally the ChaosUT was the only\
      \ one to have a Team version of KOTH as well. The key to making it compatible\
      \ with bots is base KOTH of TeamGamePlus so you can set orders for the bots.</p>\n\
      <p><b>capt. k.:</b> That's why I specified \"KOTH2\" in the original page title.\
      \ &#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I've rearranged a bit, but as I've never\
      \ played this there's some blanks I can't write: a general intro to the concept,\
      \ the general ideas involved in the maps, and the specifics for each version.\
      \ I take it none of them are compatible with each other?</p>\n<p><b>Jb:</b>\
      \ The KOTH2 code was intergrated into Marthon Rampancy so yes those are compatabile.\
      \ Saddly to say that the ChoasUT maps are not. We offered more features for\
      \ the KoTH game play but we had to do things a bit different in order to add\
      \ these features (Team version of KOTH, addtion of zone to mark hill areas,\
      \ a flag to allow for hill time given if the player is not alone on the hill\
      \ and more control over where the bot defened including moving around on the\
      \ hill). I have been looking for a way to make them compatibile but have yet\
      \ to fine one&#160;:(</p>\n<p><b>capt. k.</b> Integrated into Marathon Resurrection\
      \ and otherwise reverse compatible. I think Rampancy just builds on top of it.\
      \ I don't think there's any way to get around the dependency on KOTH2.u of maps\
      \ built around it, but as triggers aren't static, one could easily do a check\
      \ for KOTH2Hill actors after the map is loaded and replace with or add their\
      \ own hills.</p>\n<p><b>Jb:</b> Capt. K, good point and I know I can do that.\
      \ However we use Defense points to route the bots too the hill. So I could add\
      \ a defense point near the location of the KOTH2Hill Triggers that the other\
      \ mods use. But I would be worried that the bots may run into issues (like would\
      \ I have to rebuild the paths, putting defense points too close together may\
      \ cause the bots to get stuck, ect).</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time\
