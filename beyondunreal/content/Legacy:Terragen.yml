      >Terragen</a> is a free program that can make earthly or alien landscape images\
      \ (and in the newer versions, even \"animated\" flybys!). You set up the sky\
      \ color, cloud cover, sun position, terrain and optionally water, and tell the\
      \ program to render the scene. It comes with many presets and has extensive\
      \ plugin support: there are many plugins on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external text\" href=\"http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/\">Terragen</a>\
      \ website. Several are available for free download.</p>\n<p>Although, as the\
      \ program's name seems to imply, Terragen can be used for making <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Terrain\" title=\"Legacy:Terrain\">terrain</a> heightmaps, it is much\
      \ better suited to making textures for <a href=\"/Legacy:SkyBox\" title=\"Legacy:SkyBox\"\

      \ plugin to create the lava effect. Rendering it took about 5 1/2 hours. (I\
      \ think because of the lava) The most difficult parts of it were making the\
      \ atmosphere block out most of the sunlight, while still making the land visible.\
      \ The sky is still pretty screwy... I wanted more of a roiling cloud effect,\
      \ but I think that not enough light penetrated to make the roiling clouds visible.\
      \ Also, it's a little to grey/brown... Unfortunatly, there was no way to make\
      \ the lava give off light. That would have been really cool. I think it's the\
      \ greatest fault of this environment, and really makes it look unrealistic.\
      \ Heat waves would have been cool, too. (overdoing it?&#160;:) thought so...).\
      \ The other hard part was creating the \"glowing\" red rock close to the where\
      \ the rock begins to melt into the lava. I had trouble getting the color right,\
      \ and positioning the suface layer max. height so that the red color didn't\
      \ go too high on the rock. Additionally, it was hard to create the \"rivers\
      \ of lava effect\" when making the heightmap and positioning the height of the\
      \ lava. I went through generating maybe five different heightmaps before I got\
      \ it to how it looks in the picture.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

    text: "[http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/ Terragen] is a free program that\
      \ can make earthly or alien landscape images (and in the newer versions, even\
      \ \"animated\" flybys!).  You set up the sky color, cloud cover, sun position,\
      \ terrain and optionally water, and tell the program to render the scene.  It\
      \ comes with many presets and has extensive plugin support: there are many plugins\
      \ on the [http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/ Terragen] website. Several are\
      \ available for free download. \n\nAlthough, as the program's name seems to\
      \ imply, Terragen can be used for making [[Legacy:Terrain|terrain]] heightmaps,\
      \ it is much better suited to making textures for [[Legacy:SkyBox|SkyBox]]es.\n\
      \n===The Future===\n\n[http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/ Terragen 2], the\
      \ next enhanced version of Terragen has long been in development, and is currently\
      \ at a public 'Technology Preview' stage. Terragen 2 adds much graphical improvement,\
      \ and a multitude of new features, such as the ability to render entire planets.\n\
      \n==Example Renders: Terragen==\n\nThe following images briefly demonstrate\
      \ Terragen's capabilities.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_toofar.jpeg|center|Beautiful cliffs\
      \ by Frank Bosinski]]\n\n[[Image:Legacy_GalleryImage499686.jpeg|center|Another\
      \ by The same guy]]\n\n==Noob Landscapes==\n\nOf course, the above images were\
      \ created by experienced Terragen users. What you will get, even after some\
      \ experience, is something more like these:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_IceWorldRender_02640x480.jpeg|center|This\
      \ is even after alot of practice and careful planning]]\n\n[[Image:Legacy_FireWorld_Small.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nI used the WaterWorks plugin to create the lava effect. Rendering it took\
      \ about 5 1/2 hours. (I think because of the lava) The most difficult parts\
      \ of it were making the atmosphere block out most of the sunlight, while still\
      \ making the land visible. The sky is still pretty screwy... I wanted more of\
      \ a roiling cloud effect, but I think that not enough light penetrated to make\
      \ the roiling clouds visible. Also, it's a little to grey/brown... Unfortunatly,\
      \ there was no way to make the lava give off light. That would have been really\
      \ cool. I think it's the greatest fault of this environment, and really makes\
      \ it look unrealistic. Heat waves would have been cool, too. (overdoing it?\
      \ :) thought so...). The other hard part was creating the \"glowing\" red rock\
      \ close to the where the rock begins to melt into the lava. I had trouble getting\
      \ the color right, and positioning the suface layer max. height so that the\
      \ red color didn't go too high on the rock. Additionally, it was hard to create\
      \ the \"rivers of lava effect\" when making the heightmap and positioning the\
      \ height of the lava. I went through generating maybe five different heightmaps\
      \ before I got it to how it looks in the picture.\n\n==Example Renders: Terragen\

      \ hosted by planetside.co.uk\n* [http://gallery.meltingice.net/main.php Melting\
      \ Ice Terragen 2 Gallery], hosted by meltingice.net\n\n==Making Skybox Textures\
      \ with Terragen==\n\nOnce your environment is setup, you have to take snapshots\
      \ of 5 views (top and 4 sides).  You can use [http://www.planetpointy.co.uk/editing/files/terrasky.shtml\
      \ TerraSky] to automate this process or perform it manually.\n\n'''Terragen\
      \ 2 Users:''' Note that a different method of creating skyboxes is used in the\
      \ forthcoming [http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/tg2/tech_preview.shtml TerraGen\
      \ 2], and there is no automated script or plugin for Terragen 2 as of yet. An\
      \ external tutorial is included within the links at the bottom of this page.\n\
      \n===Manually Rendering the Views===\n# The camera zoom level ''must'' be set\
      \ to 1. If you choose a different zoom level, you will get texture alignment\
      \ problems.  \n# Set the camera orientation head to 0.  Set the pitch at 0.\
      \  Hit the render image button and save as sky0.bmp.\n# Set the camera orientation\
      \ head to 90 (looking right); Hit the render image button and save as sky90.bmp.\n\
      # Get it? now do the same with 180 and 270 degrees.\n# Then set the head to\
      \ 0 and pitch to 90 (looking up) and save.\n# If want a floor set the pitch\
      \ to -90.\n# Convert the .bmp to .pcx in [[Legacy:Photoshop|photoshop]] or some\
      \ other program, then import them to Unrealed.\n# The maximum size for the uregistered\
      \ version of Terragen is 960x960.  Resize in PS to 512x512 or 1024x1024.\n#\
      \ Remember to give a nod to Terragen in you map's .txt file.\n\n====Tips====\n\
      * The skybox brush size should be a multiple of your texture size. (i.e., tex.\
      \ size 512x512 make you brush 1024x1024x1024)  This makes it very easy to line\
      \ up your textures.\n* If  you encounter lines in your skybox, make the skybox\
      \ brush 1~2 units less than your texture size (i.e., 1022x1022)\n* U mapping\
      \ flips the textures on import and placement.\n* Due to the way Terragen renders\
      \ and the parallax effect of the skybox only a simple cube is needed for the\
      \ skybox brush. Spheres and cylinders are not necessary.\n\n===Terragen and\
      \ UED3===\n\nThe following information will help you render a set of skybox\
      \ textures in Terragen and set them up in UED3 w/o having those nasty white\
      \ lines.\n\n# Go to camera settings -> Zoom/Magnification set that to \"1\"\n\
      # Set your image size to something square\n# Uncheck fixed hieght above surface\
      \ for target position\n# There are three fields for camera orientation\n# Set\
      \ the first one, \"head\" to \"270\" or \"-90\"\n# Set the middle one, \"pitch\"\
      \ to \"0\"\n# Set the right one, \"bank\" to \"0\"\n# Render your image\n# Save\
      \ as \"West\"\n# For the next image simply change the \"head\" to \"0\"\n# Make\
      \ sure pitch and bank are still at \"0\"\n# Render, save as \"North\"\n# Change\
      \ the head to \"90\"\n# Make sure pitch and bank are still at \"0\"\n# Render,\
      \ save as \"East\"\n# Change head to \"180\"\n# Make sure pitch and bank are\
      \ still at \"0\"\n# Render, save as \"South\"\n# Now, leave the head at \"180\"\
      \ and for pitch enter \"90\"\n# Make sure bank is still at \"0\" <br />(doing\
      \ it this way for the top and bottom sets the render up so it imports at the\
      \ right rotation to UED)\n# Render, save as \"Up\"\n# Set the pitch to \"-90\"\
      \n# Make sure head is still at \"180\" and bank at \"0\"\n# Render, save as\
      \ \"Down\"\n# Do whatever post processing you need to make them importable.\
      \ You will preferably size them to 1024x1024 to conform with this tutorial.\n\
      # Once you get them into [[Legacy:MyLevel|MyLevel]] you will want to open the\
      \ properties of each tex and change -> Texture ->UClampMode and VClampMode to\
      \ TC_Clamp.  This stretches the border pixels of an image and will remvoe the\
      \ white seams.\n# Set the grid to 4096\n# Make a cube 1024 all three dimensions\n\
      # Right click it, Reset -> All\n# Now slide it somewhere to the left out of\
      \ the way\n# Subtract, select all faces align ->to face, then pan ONE unit U\
      \ and ONE unit V \n# Flag unlit\n# Apply the textures using the top down view\
      \ as the orientation would be if it was a map. Left=West, Right=East \n\netc...\

      \ Terragen is a great piece of software, but you have to be careful when working\
      \ with it, as the temptation exists to \"overdo it,\" and create very complicated\
      \ environments that, in the end, don't look very good... I'm very glad that\
      \ Terragen now incorporates realtime preview rendering, because it was a pain\
      \ in the ass to have to do a rendering preview every time you wanted to see\
      \ what would show up on the output images. Umm...question: does anyone know\
      \ of a way to take the surface maps and put them on the terrain in UEd? I hope\
      \ I'm making sense...\n\n'''Bob_The_Beheader:''' Some renders of Terragen environments,\
      \ especially when using 3rd party plugins and when rendering at high detail\
      \ settings and high resoulutions, have taken upwards of 6 hours to complete.\
      \ This is on my 3.2ghz computer... :rolleyes:\n\n'''King Mango''' I'm not sure\
      \ we need the pictures on this page. Terragen is capable of much more than that\
      \ and I think it's better to link to off site galleries like Luc Bianco, Oshyan,\
      \ and a dozen more real masters of the program.\\\n\n'''FreshMeat''' we need\
      \ instructions on how to make a heightmap with teragen.\n\n'''Outpt''' Updated\
      \ the page with Terragen 2 information. Minor corrections. I think the images\
      \ need to be cut down a little, such as the lava example, anyone agree?\n\n\
      '''Bob_The_Beheader''' FreshMeat: Terragen certainly isn't the best software\
      \ out there for heightmap creation. [http://www.world-machine.com/ WorldMachine]\
      \ is a great piece of software for very realistic heightmaps that don't look\
      \ like they've been randomly generated and then raised and lowered by hand.\n\
