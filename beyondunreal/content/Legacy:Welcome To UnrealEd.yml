      <p>When you start up UnrealEd, you should be presented with an empty map: the\
      \ three orthogonal <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Viewport\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\

      \ will show empty black space, with a grid of blue lines if your monitor brightness\

      \ &gt; New</i> from the menu;</p>\n<p>If there are no viewports at all select\
      \ <i>View &gt; Viewports &gt; Configure...</i> This will bring up a window with\
      \ various viewport layouts. Just select one and click ok.</p>\n<p>The world\
      \ is one enormous cube. You can zoom out of an orthogonal view with the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Mouse_Control\" title=\"Legacy:Mouse Control\">mouse</a> to see the\
      \ entire space. The dimensions are truly staggering, and very few maps make\
      \ full use of the space (Sunspire from <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_1\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Unreal 1\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Unreal 1</a> and that ocean floor Assault\
      \ map from UT are a couple of examples).</p>\n<p>The Unreal engine considers\
      \ the world to be <i>solid</i> even though in the 3D view it appears to be empty.\
      \ This is a crucial difference from most other 3D game engines. A mapper creates\
      \ a playing environment by carving solid shapes out of the world: imagine carving\
      \ holes in dough with a cookie cutter. UnrealEd does the same thing, but in\
      \ 3 dimensions. It may be helpful to think of the Unreal world as a huge cube\

      \ title=\"Legacy:EntropicLqd\">EntropicLqd</a>)</p>\n<p>When familiarizing yourself\
      \ with UnrealEd 2, typically, the novice mapper creates a simple Death Match\
      \ map and play tests it. The essential element is the room, which is a subtractive\
      \ operation. And, the simplest primitive shape, or Brush, for a room is the\
      \ cube. All design dimensions are chosen with respect to the apparent size of\
      \ TournamentPlayer, (see, General Scale and Dimensions); player height is approximately\
      \ 80 world units high, and 35 world units wide. Room height must be considerably\
      \ higher (to accomodate jumps and other features such as stairs and lifts),\
      \ and even connective hallways should be at least twice the player width, and\
      \ for pathnoding Bots, should be at least 100 world units (50 world units away\
      \ from corners). Look to the left of the viewport, where the toolbox and brushbuilder?s\
      \ are located. You can either left click or right click the button for the Cube\
      \ Brushbuilder. A left click will create a cube brush with default dimensions\
      \ (256 height, 256 width, 256 length) in the viewing area. A right click will\
      \ produce a dialog box in which numerical entries can be made that will become\
      \ the actual world unit dimensions of the cube. These dimensions can be changed\
      \ at will at any time before the brush is actually added or subtracted, respectively,\
      \ to or from the world. Try several combinations, and view the results in the\
      \ various different viewports. As a suggestion: when making your first room,\
      \ don't make it too humongeous (a common error), or your PlayerPawn will be\
      \ dwarfed to insignificance. Also, enable the Snap to Grid feature (way at the\
      \ bottom of the Viewport area); this makes designing easier for a number of\
      \ reasons and generally eliminates BSP Holes from forming in your Level.</p>\n\
      <p>The thing that finally made the penny drop about the editor was when I realized\
      \ I could add a shape to the world and then move it around and it's properties\
      \ would be maintained. Before that I'd always delete the original brush and\
      \ create a new one in the place I really wanted it (duh! but then I'd never\
      \ read any tutorials either). That was the point I really appreciated the solid\
      \ geometry aspects of level building. Might be worth adding a step to move the\
      \ initial room subtract without moving the player start so their relative positions\
      \ change – <a href=\"/Legacy:EntropicLqd\" title=\"Legacy:EntropicLqd\">EntropicLqd</a>.</p>\n\

      \n==Stuff that this page needs to cover ==\n\nI've read a few n00b posts on\
      \ forums recently that have given me ideas on what to cover here. \n\n* The\
      \ basics of how the world is put together: brush wireframes & actors. UEd creates\
      \ the 3d world from the brushes.\n\nthe following list is for [[Legacy:Unreal\
      \ Geometry|Unreal Geometry]]\n\n* ... and surfaces != brushes. Common n00b mistake\
      \ to refer to surfaces as brushes, and thence the confusion of why moving a\
      \ brush doesn't move a surface.\n* the 2nd layer: actors.\n* why each time you\
      \ click on a primitive, you get a new shape replacing the old one\n* the fact\
      \ that geomtery in the 3D view is not permanent &ndash; why it doesn't change\
      \ when you move corresponding brushes (quake mappers particularly will be confused\
      \ by this) and v. quick intro to rebuilding.\n\n----\n\nWe’ll be perfectly honest:\
      \ the learning curve is sharp. Even when you know all the functions of the editor,\
      \ making maps that look good will still take a lot of practice.\n\nYou may want\
      \ to see [[Legacy:UnrealEd Interface|UnrealEd Interface]] to find out more about\
      \ the various parts of the screen. The mouse has many different functions, so\
      \ you may want to open the [[Legacy:Mouse Control|mouse control]] reference\
      \ in another window.\n\n===Carving the World ===\n\nWhen you start up UnrealEd,\
      \ you should be presented with an empty map: the three orthogonal [[Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Viewport|UnrealEd Viewport]]s will show a grey grid, and the 3D viewport will\
      \ show empty black space, with a grid of blue lines if your monitor brightness\
      \ is turned up to \"sunburn\".\n\nIf this is not the case, select ''File > New''\
      \ from the menu;\n\nIf there are no viewports at all select ''View > Viewports\
      \ > Configure...'' This will bring up a window with various viewport layouts.\
      \ Just select one and click ok.\n\nThe world is one enormous cube. You can zoom\
      \ out of an orthogonal view with the [[Legacy:Mouse Control|mouse]] to see the\
      \ entire space. The dimensions are truly staggering, and very few maps make\
      \ full use of the space (Sunspire from [[Legacy:Unreal 1|Unreal 1]] and that\
      \ ocean floor Assault map from UT are a couple of examples). \n\nThe Unreal\
      \ engine considers the world to be ''solid'' even though in the 3D view it appears\
      \ to be empty. This is a crucial difference from most other 3D game engines.\
      \ A mapper creates a playing environment by carving solid shapes out of the\
      \ world: imagine carving holes in dough with a cookie cutter. UnrealEd does\
      \ the same thing, but in 3 dimensions. It may be helpful to think of the Unreal\
      \ world as a huge cube of clay, waiting to have something carved within it.\n\
      \nThe Technical name for carving is called \"Boolean transformations\"\n\n===Brushes\
      \ ===\n\nA [[Legacy:Brush|brush]] is a 3-dimensional shape. Most brushes in\
      \ any given map will be simple box shapes. Too see what other basic shapes are\
      \ possible, click on any of the [[Legacy:Brushbuilders|brushbuilder]] buttons\
      \ in the toolbox on the left-hand side of the screen &ndash; those that show\
      \ green-ish 3D shapes.\n\nBrushes describe the world. Unlike the hole in the\
      \ cookie dough, a brush that carves a hole in the world can be moved, rotated,\
      \ re-sized, or even have its shape altered.\n\n''Subtractive'' brushes make\
      \ a hole in the world. ''Additive'' brushes add solid material back in &ndash;\
      \ for example, a pillar or a walkway is usually an additive brush.\n\nStarting\
      \ with the empty (or rather entirely full) world, the first brush operation\
      \ is by necessity a subtraction.\n\n----\n\n==Important Level Designing Considerations\
      \ ==\n\n; Aligning all geometry to the grid : At the bottom right corner of\
      \ the [[Legacy:UnrealEd Interface|UnrealEd Interface]] is the [[Legacy:Snap\
      \ To Grid|Snap to Grid]] checkbox. (See discussion in [[Legacy:BSP Holes|BSP\
      \ Holes]].) It's recommended that you enable the ''Snap to Grid'' feature. It\
      \ generally makes it much easier to align adjacent brushes accurately, without\
      \ infinitesimal gaps; and, it helps eliminate the possibility of rampant BSP\
      \ Holes. The [[Legacy:Pivot|pivot]] point of the brush is actually \"snapped\"\
      \ to the grid when you do this. Usually the pivot point is located in the center\
      \ of the brush, but it can be moved for a number of reasons.\n\n; Rebuild your\
      \ level often : UnrealEd can crash if too many actors are added in one rebuild;\
      \ and, the editor log will give you information about potential problems (inventory\
      \ placement, reachspecs, warnings, and alerts). Also, when you have a BSP hole\
      \ in your level, it's easier to diagnose the cause if you have a smaller number\
      \ of actors to search (no log warnings on BSP holes).\n\n; Vertex editing can\
      \ be problematic for novices : Most mappers tend to view their design process\
      \ through just one window (typically, a 3D view), and it can be difficult to\
      \ recognize when you are dragging a vertex into a geometrically impossible position,\

      \ which is a subtractive operation. And, the simplest primitive shape, or Brush,\
      \ for a room is the cube. All design dimensions are chosen with respect to the\
      \ apparent size of TournamentPlayer, (see, General Scale and Dimensions); player\
      \ height is approximately 80 world units high, and 35 world units wide. Room\
      \ height must be considerably higher (to accomodate jumps and other features\
      \ such as stairs and lifts), and even connective hallways should be at least\
      \ twice the player width, and for pathnoding Bots, should be at least 100 world\
      \ units (50 world units away from corners). Look to the left of the viewport,\
      \ where the toolbox and brushbuilder?s are located. You can either left click\
      \ or right click the button for the Cube Brushbuilder. A left click will create\
      \ a cube brush with default dimensions (256 height, 256 width, 256 length) in\
      \ the viewing area. A right click will produce a dialog box in which numerical\
      \ entries can be made that will become the actual world unit dimensions of the\
      \ cube. These dimensions can be changed at will at any time before the brush\
      \ is actually added or subtracted, respectively, to or from the world. Try several\
      \ combinations, and view the results in the various different viewports. As\
      \ a suggestion: when making your first room, don't make it too humongeous (a\
      \ common error), or your PlayerPawn will be dwarfed to insignificance. Also,\
      \ enable the Snap to Grid feature (way at the bottom of the Viewport area);\
      \ this makes designing easier for a number of reasons and generally eliminates\
      \ BSP Holes from forming in your Level.\n\nThe thing that finally made the penny\
      \ drop about the editor was when I realized I could add a shape to the world\
      \ and then move it around and it's properties would be maintained.  Before that\
      \ I'd always delete the original brush and create a new one in the place I really\
      \ wanted it (duh! but then I'd never read any tutorials either).  That was the\
      \ point I really appreciated the solid geometry aspects of level building. \
      \ Might be worth adding a step to move the initial room subtract without moving\
      \ the player start so their relative positions change &ndash; [[Legacy:EntropicLqd|EntropicLqd]].\n\
