      <p>Health can be difficult to place. Place too much and players will not be\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>If your map is aimed at a low number of players having\
      \ one or two large health packs on the level is better than having many smaller\
      \ ones. This adds points of control to the map that will concentrate combat\
      \ and add tension to a map that otherwise wouldn't be there. For fewer players\
      \ high amounts of armour should also be avoided - place a small amount of armour\
      \ away from the health. By moving the armour away players will be forced to\
      \ travel the level in its entirety allowing suprise attacks and a bit of hope\
      \ for a player whose just been killed.</p>\n<p>On larger deathmatch levels look\
      \ for the rooms that can be easily held and then distribute health and armour\
      \ away from those places. Having a very small amount of health in this type\
      \ of room is a good thing, but too much and you'll unbalance Team Deathmatch\
      \ play.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Capture_the_Flag\">Capture\

      Edit section: Capture the Flag\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The placement of health and armour around a CTF map\
      \ is critical to achieving a good balance of attack and defense. Too little\
      \ health in and around the flag room and defenders will have a hard time keeping\
      \ the flag inside the base. Too much health and even the most co-ordinated attack\
      \ will struggle. As a general rule of thumb a single health pack per defending\
      \ player should be sufficient.</p>\n<p>Placing a small amount of health along\
      \ the main routes between the two flags is a good idea. However, ensure that\
      \ it will cost the flag carrier some time to collect it. The way the flag carrier\
      \ can trade safety (in terms of the likelihood of getting killed) against speed\
      \ of escape. Any more than a tenth of a second is probably too much time wasted.</p>\n\
      <p>By the very nature of the game type, most of the health and armour will be\
      \ located at either end of the map. Depending on the structure of your map it\
      \ may be better to adopt a more even spread of health throughout the level.</p>\n\
      <p>Always place armour away from the flag base. It's generally better to favour\
      \ attackers when placing armour but also ensure that it costs time to collect\
      \ it. The armour placement in Coret is a fine example of this. Both the 100\
      \ armour and 50 armour require a player to go slightly out of their way to obtain\
      \ them, and neither of them are that close to the flag and the defenders.</p>\n\

  wikitext:
    text: "The placement of inventory items around your map can either aid or hinder\
      \ gameplay.  Item positioning is crucial to the [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]].\
      \  Too much health and combat becomes a slow tortuous affair.  Too little and\
      \ players will not be able to recover sufficiently from each fight to avoid\
      \ getting killed in the next.  Similarly, a balance should be struck for all\
      \ powerups, ammo, weapons and other items in order to support map flow and make\
      \ the most of a map's layout.  The [[Legacy:Gametype|gametype]] your map is\
      \ aimed at will influence the positioning of your items.\n\nThe following are\
      \ not hard and fast rules, in fact, they should be ignored or contradicted from\
      \ time to time for variety's sake.  They are just suggestions to consider while\
      \ designing the level for best gameplay.\n\n{{innerbox| '''CliffyB's Rule: Counter\
      \ Desirability with Risk'''\n\n Put desirable things such as powerful weapons\
      \ in a dangerous or exposed spot.  In DM that means in an exposed spot, such\
      \ as an open space, a junction or a blind alley.  In team maps it means, in\
      \ no-man's-land. (aka, ''Risk vs Reward'')\n\n}}\n\n==Game Objectives==\n\n\
      Placement of [[Legacy:GameObjective|GameObjective]]s is crucial.  The layout\
      \ of the map is usually centered around the placement of these special items\
      \ and this is where item placement should begin.  Some gametypes, namely Deathmatch,\
      \ do not have a GameObjective actor to place.  Although, one could argue with\
      \ confidence that [[Legacy:PlayerStart|PlayerStart]]s should be treated with\
      \ the same importance as game objectives in those instances.  Capture the Flag\
      \ FlagBases, Bombing Run BombSpawns and BombDeliveries, Double Domination DomPoints\
      \ and Onslaught PowerNodes and PowerCores are all examples of Game Objectives.\
      \  First and foremost, the Game Objectives should be equal all sides of the\
      \ match; equally accessible, equally attainable.\n\n==Weapons==\n\nWhen considering\
      \ weapon placement, keep in mind how easy and quick it is to reach a weapon.\
      \ While keeping in mind CliffyB's rule, remember that if one cannot find a weapon\
      \ in a reasonable amount of time, one may get frustrated. If this is the case,\
      \ often times a few will reach weapons and therefore dominate those that cannot.\
      \  Consider giving an equal distance from playerstart to weapon.  Also consider\
      \ placing a good \"starter weapon\" near each player start, so that the respawning\
      \ player is facing a weapon they can grab and immediately join the fray.\n\n\
      ===Specific Weapon Suggestions===\n; Assault Rifle : Usually you aren't going\
      \ to put extra assault rifles in a map, people get dual assault rifles by killing\
      \ other people.  But if you do place them, put them in an area where the player\
      \ should've picked up another weapon already.\n; Translocator : Although normally\
      \ given to each player at map start, the translocator can be given via PickUpBase\
      \ in gametypes that do not allow translocators or match configurations  that\
      \ do not give them at map start.  Place these near player starts or areas where\
      \ the translocator would be useful. (i.e., a large chasm or high ledge)\n; Chainsaw\
      \ (UT) : Cramped places that allow charging attacks.\n; BioRifle : At the end\
      \ of a tunnel or a main doorway.  Perhaps somewhere dark or confined.  Place\
      \ it near a game objective or near a room that can be held.\n; Shock Rifle :\
      \ Best in open areas; corridors for combo shots.\n; MiniGun : Near areas where\
      \ heated combat and crossfire is likely.\n; Link Gun : Try to put this near\
      \ every power node in Onslaught because you need it to heal power nodes and\
      \ vehicles.  This weapon is crucial for more than fighting in Onslaught and\
      \ other gametypes that allow vehicles.\n; Flak Cannon : Best in cramped or confined\
      \ areas for more opportunities for bounce shots and splash damage. (Most memorable\
      \ example of this: The crenulated 270-degree-curved hallway in UT's DM-Grinder\
      \ &rarr;StarWeaver)\n; Rocket Launcher : Best in places with walls for splash\
      \ damage, but uncramped and uncluttered to avoid accidental suicides.\n; Lightning\
      \ Gun and Sniper Rifle : Near places that are good for sniping.  But you should\
      \ consider the differences between the two.  With Sniper Rifles, it is more\
      \ difficult to locate the firer, and it fires faster than the lightning gun.\
      \  But the Lightning Gun does more damage and doesn't have that annoying fog.\n\
      ; Redeemer : Due to it's high power and ability to be guided, put this in a\
      \ hidden and or hard to reach place.\n; Ion Painter : In a wide open area that\
      \ can aim at a big open area.  The blast effect of this weapon is made to take\
      \ out large or numberous opponents.\n\n==Ammunition==\n\nIt's useful to consider\
      \ the placement of ammunition independantly of the actual positioning of the\
      \ weapon.  It is usually a good idea to place ammo for a weapon near the weapon\
      \ placement itself, however having extra stashes of different ammo adds a good\
      \ measure of variety.  If these stashes are particularly extensive, put them\
      \ in hard to reach or hidden areas.\n\n==Powerups==\n\nPowerups give a player\
      \ an extra boost of some kind.  These goodies should be positioned in such a\
      \ way that when the player needs them most, they can find them available.  Keeping\
      \ in mind ''Risk vs Reward'', place more powerful items in hard to reach or\
      \ hidden places.\n\n===Health===\n\nHealth can be difficult to place.  Place\
      \ too much and players will not be vulnerable enough to score kills on each\
      \ other.  Place too little and player will die too easily to enjoy the match.\
      \  Health is the commodity that keeps players alive, so it is the most critical\
      \ of the powerups.\n\n====MiniHealth====\n\nBecause these can give players more\
      \ than 100 health (although in small doses), you can place these near PlayerStarts,\
      \ espcially those near dangerous areas.  The small health boost encourages the\
      \ mapper to place a multiple vials in clusters or rows along a path.\n\n====Health\
      \ Pack====\n\nThe general health powerup should be available to players who\
      \ need it.  Place these on the outside of major battle areas, or places that\
      \ players may want to otherwise retreat to.\n\n====Keg O' Health====\n\nThis\
      \ is a major powerup and should be reserved for those players who go the extra\
      \ mile to find it.  It should either be in a dangerous area (open or prone to\
      \ crossfire), an area that is dangerous to get to (on a small ledge over lava\
      \ or the like) or hidden from view.\n\n===Shield===\n\nShield powerups add an\
      \ extra protection for players.  Think of this as a bonus, not as critical as\
      \ health.  Give shield powerups to players who will need it to launch a dangerous\
      \ attach or defend against the odds.\n\n====Shield Pack====\n\nThe basic shield\
      \ powerup gives enough shield to protect the player during a small encounter\
      \ with the enemy.  Place these along paths that lead to heavy battle zones.\n\
      \n====Super Shield====\n\nThis is another major powerup, like the Keg O' Health.\
      \  This should be difficult or dangerous to get to or it should be out of plain\
      \ sight.\n\n===UDamage (Double Damage Amp)===\n\nThis is the third major powerup,\
      \ giving the players an advantage in combat.  Place near areas of heated battle\
      \ or crossfire so they have a chance to use them.  However, due to it's power,\
      \ it should also be hard to reach and / or hidden.\n\n===Adrenaline===\n\n[[Legacy:Adrenaline|Adrenaline]]\
      \ allows players to collect enough energy to perform a special adrenaline combo:\
      \ a move that can give them a special power of their choosing for a short period\
      \ of time.  This is a special power that should be given as a reward for finding\
      \ a particularly dangerous space.  Place these in open spaces or where crossfire\
      \ is common.  Place enough to allow each of the recommended number of players\
      \ to perform a combo at least once in a typical match.\n\n==Vehicle Factories==\n\
      \nVehicles serve several purposes.  They are a source of increase mobility,\
      \ even carrying multiple players at once.  They are also equipped with increased\
      \ armor, weapons and ammo.  These plusses make vehicles highly desirable.  Place\
      \ these Vehicle Factories in places that allow a respawning player to get back\
      \ in the action quick.  Place them so players can enter a highly dangerous area\
      \ well protected and equally matched to the danger.  Take into account the speed\
      \ and mobility of the vehicle; do not place a slow-moving Tank or Leviathan\
      \ so far away from the heat of battle that player will be frustrated.  Lightweight\
      \ vehicles should likewise be used in areas where heavy combat is not as likely.\n\
      \nSee also [[Legacy:Vehicle Gameplay|Vehicle Gameplay]].\n\n==Gametype Specific\
      \ Suggestions==\n\n===Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch===\n\nIf your map is aimed\
      \ at a low number of players having one or two large health packs on the level\
      \ is better than having many smaller ones.  This adds points of control to the\
      \ map that will concentrate combat and add tension to a map that otherwise wouldn't\
      \ be there.  For fewer players high amounts of armour should also be avoided\
      \ - place a small amount of armour away from the health.  By moving the armour\
      \ away players will be forced to travel the level in its entirety allowing suprise\
      \ attacks and a bit of hope for a player whose just been killed.\n\nOn larger\
      \ deathmatch levels look for the rooms that can be easily held and then distribute\
      \ health and armour away from those places.  Having a very small amount of health\
      \ in this type of room is a good thing, but too much and you'll unbalance Team\
      \ Deathmatch play.\n\n===Capture the Flag===\n\nThe placement of health and\
      \ armour around a CTF map is critical to achieving a good balance of attack\
      \ and defense.  Too little health in and around the flag room and defenders\
      \ will have a hard time keeping the flag inside the base.  Too much health and\
      \ even the most co-ordinated attack will struggle.  As a general rule of thumb\
      \ a single health pack per defending player should be sufficient.\n\nPlacing\
      \ a small amount of health along the main routes between the two flags is a\
      \ good idea.  However, ensure that it will cost the flag carrier some time to\
      \ collect it.  The way the flag carrier can trade safety (in terms of the likelihood\
      \ of getting killed) against speed of escape.  Any more than a tenth of a second\
      \ is probably too much time wasted.\n\nBy the very nature of the game type,\
      \ most of the health and armour will be located at either end of the map.  Depending\
      \ on the structure of your map it may be better to adopt a more even spread\
      \ of health throughout the level.\n\nAlways place armour away from the flag\
      \ base.  It's generally better to favour attackers when placing armour but also\
      \ ensure that it costs time to collect it.  The armour placement in Coret is\
      \ a fine example of this.  Both the 100 armour and 50 armour require a player\
      \ to go slightly out of their way to obtain them, and neither of them are that\
      \ close to the flag and the defenders.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Map\
