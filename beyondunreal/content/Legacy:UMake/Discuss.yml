      <p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> Mychaeel, how did you implement the \"abort\" feature\
      \ of umake&#160;? I'm working on a `ucc server` wrapper to make my debugging\
      \ a bit easier. But I can't get to shutdown the server proberly, I've tried\
      \ that winapi method to send a ^C but it doesn't work for some reason.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Under Windows NT/2000/XP, UMake simply closes the console\
      \ window. Under Windows 9x/ME, it uses keybd_event to send VK_CONTROL and VK_CANCEL\
      \ key press and release events. – But even though that works, there's another\
      \ pitfall with \"ucc\": It doesn't abort cleanly. A Visual C++ error dialog\
      \ appears when the program is aborted (happens when you do it manually too),\
      \ so I wrapped the \"ucc make\" process in a pseudo-debugging environment which\
      \ handles the program abortion exception in ucc's stead.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> I have a problem with UMake (probably\
      \ due to my code). When umake starts compiling my subclass of Tab_InstantActionBaseRules\
      \ (myRulesTab) UMake stops responding as if it was in an infinite loop. When\
      \ I try the same code with UCC I get the following:</p>\n<pre> Importing Defaults\
      \ for myRulesTab\n The file '..\\mypackage\\Inc\\myPackageClasses.h' needs to\
      \ be updated.\n Do you want to overwrite the existing version? (Y/N):\n</pre>\n\
      <p>If I say Y then it gives me:</p>\n<pre> Error exporting Class Core.Object:\
      \ couldn't open file '..\\mypackage\\Inc\\myPackageClasses.h'\n Failure - 1\
      \ error(s), 0 warning(s)\n</pre>\n<p>If I say N then it compiles without errors.\
      \ Other than that the code runs fine (I think). – So, what should I do? What\
      \ is the problem? I don't think my class has any probles. I could post the code.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Sounds like you're having a superfluous \"native\" somewhere\
      \ (otherwise the compiler would not ask for updating a .h file). By the way,\
      \ you should see the same message when clicking \"Details,\" and by clicking\
      \ \"Abort\" you should always be able to close UMake when that happens.</p>\n\
      <p><b>AlphaOne:</b> What does superfluous native mean? The problem with UMake\
      \ is that in MY case clicking Abort does NOT abort. In fact the only way to\
      \ close UMake is to kill it! That's the reason why I went to UCC. Anyways, Someone\
      \ else gave me that code and it compiles fine for that person. Moreover, if\
      \ I choose the \"N\" option in UCC then the code compiles perfectly and works\
      \ fine as well. I just want UMake not to hang on me like this.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ The problem is that \"ucc\" asks for user interaction, and UMake doesn't support\
      \ that. (There's a switch in UT2003's \"ucc\" to suppress any user interaction.\
      \ UMake doesn't use it, but could in a possible future version – just to be\
      \ sure.)</p>\n<p>The <i>actual</i> problem is in the code you're compiling though.\
      \ Normally the compiler doesn't require any user interaction, and that request\
      \ about creating \"myPackageClasses.h\" is a strong indication that something\
      \ is in that UnrealScript code that shouldn't be there – namely a reference\
      \ to native code via the \"native\" keyword. Since mod makers have no means\
      \ to actually create native code to work with UnrealScript code, any \"native\"\
      \ in the UnrealScript code is bound to be out of place. I can only guess, but\
      \ maybe your coder just copied some of Epic's code without really understanding\
      \ it and thus got a superfluous \"native\" into what actually should be pure\
      \ UnrealScript code.</p>\n<p>If that's not it, send me your .uc file to mychaeel@beyondunreal.com\
      \ and I'll look into the problem more closely.</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> Thanks\
      \ a bunch! Some of the code did have a native class declaration. I didn't realise\
      \ that someonelse's file was in the package, so I didn't bother to look there\
      \ until I searched for the word \"native\" in ALL of my classes! Anyways, UMake\
      \ is a wonderful program!</p>\n<p><b>Ferazel2001:</b> Wow... im so glad theres\
      \ an alternitave to UDE... I thought I was stuck with either that or UnrealEd,\
      \ Now that I have gotten EditPlus and UMake set up, life is really looking up!\

  wikitext:
    text: "==Suggestions==\n\n===Restart Button===\n\n'''Tarquin:''' It would be nice\
      \ for the \"compile failed\" window to have a \"start again\" button &ndash;\
      \ avoids having to restart the program or go back via options.\n\n===Compiling\
      \ Multiple Packages===\n\n'''DJPaul:''' Can this thing re-compile multiple packages\
      \ AT ONCE?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' It's not designed to, or at least the frontend\
      \ isn't.  I think compiling multiple packages at once is not a very common task\
      \ though.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' You'd have to add the additional packages to the\
      \ project in UMake, but if you want to recompile them then you'll have to delete\
      \ them manually. I recommend creating multiple projects for that though.\n\n\
      ===Dependency List Management===\n\n'''Unknown:'''  Would it be possible for\
      \ the Dependencies list in the Project tab to have some way of \"uncheck all\
      \ below this\" and \"check all above this\"?\n\n===Succes/Failed, but where\
      \ is the warning?===\n\n'''Daid303:''' How about an option that does something\
      \ (something else then succes) on a succesfull compile with warnings, because\
      \ most of the time you do want to fix your warnings. And the UCC with the runtime\
      \ engine nevers shows up 'X errors' it thinks all errors are warnings for some\
      \ reason.\n\n===Extra command line option===\n\n'''Daid303:''' wouldn't it be\
      \ nice to have an option to give extra commands to UCC, like -Debug.\n\n===Support\
      \ for UT2004's <tt>-mod-</tt> feature===\n\n'''Wormbo:''' This is somewhat related\
      \ to the \"Extra command line option\" suggestion above, but may be worth mentioning\
      \ on its own. The <code>-mod-</code> parameter implies certain changes in the\
      \ directory structure of the source code (as opposed to compiling without <code>-mod-</code>)\
      \ UMake doesn't handle yet, I think.\n\n===Support for UT3===\n\n'''Medic:'''\
      \ Any plans to support UT3?\n\n==Bugs==\n\n===Cache export seems to break something\
      \ here===\n\nThe new UT2004 version (3270) seems to have problems with UCC.\
      \ Because of the automatic cache export. \n\nWORKAROUND:\n\nOpen the make.ini\
      \ in your project directory and add the line\n CacheRecordPath=*.ucl\n\nin the\
      \ [Core.System] section.\n\n===Project Tab and Long Package Names===\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Project tab: \"The options on this tab only affect the ...\" text runs off\
      \ the screen with long package names.\n\n===Errors Outside the Compiled Package===\n\
      \n'''El Muerte TDS:''' somewhat of a bug, when you make a mistake in a other\
      \ package, on what the current package depends the edit button will try open\
      \ that file from the current package (which mostlikely won't exist)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Normally UMake will extract the full file name from the \"ucc make\" log and\
      \ simply use that.  In a few cases the compiler doesn't provide a full file\
      \ name but only a class name; in those cases UMake tries to guess the name of\
      \ the .uc file using the class name and the current package name.  I could improve\
      \ that algorithm though by using the name of the last package the compiler started\
      \ to process (I simply didn't think of the possibility that there could be an\
      \ error in a different package than the one that's being compiled).\n\n'''El\
      \ Muerte TDS:''' you could also check if the file event exists in the current\
      \ package\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' That's right.  I'll keep that in mind for the next\
      \ version.\n\n===Warnings About Missing Import Files===\n\n'''Wormbo:''' When\
      \ compiling a UT project I got a compiler warning about a texture that couldn't\
      \ be imported. UMake correctly displayed that warning and the corresponding\
      \ script file, but the Edit button opens the next script file parsed.\n\n===GPF\
      \ after successfull compilation with UT2004 v3197 (and later)===\n\n'''Wormbo:'''\
      \ From beta patch v3197 and onward, the Make [[Legacy:Commandlet|commandlet]]\
      \ automatically runs the ExportCache commandlet as well. When compiling with\
      \ UMake, this part causes a General Protection Fault because the [Core.System]\
      \ section of the UMake project ini file entry is missing the line\n\n CacheRecordPath=../System/*.ucl\n\
      \nThe compiled U file is saved correctly, though.\n\nAnd while I'm at it, adding\
      \ Suppress=DevLoad and Suppress=DevSave to the [Core.System] section as well\
      \ wouldn't hurt in UT2004.\n\n===Warnings about unused or obscured variables,\
      \ structs and enums===\n\n'''Wormbo:''' The warnings UCC displays about unused\
      \ or obscured variables or obscured structs or enums aren't displayed in the\
      \ Warnings tab.<br />Now when they are the cause of a compiler error (e.g. \"\
      type mismatch in =\" on a line with \"A = B;\", where A is of type thisClass.SomeStruct\
      \ and B is of type parentClass.SomeStruct) it's pure luck to find them because\
      \ UMake switches to the \"Errors\" tab without showing the warnings.\n\n==Questions\
      \ and Problems==\n\n===Aborting UCC===\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' Mychaeel, how\
      \ did you implement the \"abort\" feature of umake ? I'm working on a `ucc server`\
      \ wrapper to make my debugging a bit easier. But I can't get to shutdown the\
      \ server proberly, I've tried that winapi method to send a ^C but it doesn't\
      \ work for some reason.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Under Windows NT/2000/XP, UMake simply\
      \ closes the console window.  Under Windows 9x/ME, it uses keybd_event to send\
      \ VK_CONTROL and VK_CANCEL key press and release events. &ndash; But even though\
      \ that works, there's another pitfall with \"ucc\":  It doesn't abort cleanly.\
      \  A Visual C++ error dialog appears when the program is aborted (happens when\
      \ you do it manually too), so I wrapped the \"ucc make\" process in a pseudo-debugging\
      \ environment which handles the program abortion exception in ucc's stead.\n\
      \n===UCC User Interaction===\n\n'''AlphaOne:''' I have a problem with UMake\
      \ (probably due to my code). When umake starts compiling my subclass of Tab_InstantActionBaseRules\
      \ (myRulesTab) UMake stops responding as if it was in an infinite loop.  When\
      \ I try the same code with UCC I get the following:\n  Importing Defaults for\
      \ myRulesTab\n  The file '..\\mypackage\\Inc\\myPackageClasses.h' needs to be\
      \ updated.\n  Do you want to overwrite the existing version? (Y/N):\n\nIf I\
      \ say Y then it gives me:\n  Error exporting Class Core.Object: couldn't open\
      \ file '..\\mypackage\\Inc\\myPackageClasses.h'\n  Failure - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)\n\
      \nIf I say N then it compiles without errors. Other than that the code runs\
      \ fine (I think). &ndash; So, what should I do? What is the problem? I don't\
      \ think my class has  any probles. I could post the code.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Sounds like you're having a superfluous \"native\" somewhere (otherwise the\
      \ compiler would not ask for updating a .h file).  By the way, you should see\
      \ the same message when clicking \"Details,\" and by clicking \"Abort\" you\
      \ should always be able to close UMake when that happens.\n\n'''AlphaOne:'''\
      \ What does superfluous native mean? The problem with UMake is that in MY case\
      \ clicking Abort does NOT abort. In fact the only way to close UMake is to kill\
      \ it! That's the reason why I went to UCC. Anyways, Someone else gave me that\
      \ code and it compiles fine for that person. Moreover, if I choose the \"N\"\
      \ option in UCC then the code compiles perfectly and works fine as well. I just\
      \ want UMake not to hang on me like this.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' The problem is\
      \ that \"ucc\" asks for user interaction, and UMake doesn't support that.  (There's\
      \ a switch in UT2003's \"ucc\" to suppress any user interaction.  UMake doesn't\
      \ use it, but could in a possible future version &ndash; just to be sure.)\n\
      \nThe ''actual'' problem is in the code you're compiling though.  Normally the\
      \ compiler doesn't require any user interaction, and that request about creating\
      \ \"myPackageClasses.h\" is a strong indication that something is in that UnrealScript\
      \ code that shouldn't be there &ndash; namely a reference to native code via\
      \ the \"native\" keyword.  Since mod makers have no means to actually create\
      \ native code to work with UnrealScript code, any \"native\" in the UnrealScript\
      \ code is bound to be out of place.  I can only guess, but maybe your coder\
      \ just copied some of Epic's code without really understanding it and thus got\
      \ a superfluous \"native\" into what actually should be pure UnrealScript code.\n\
      \nIf that's not it, send me your .uc file to mychaeel@beyondunreal.com and I'll\
      \ look into the problem more closely.\n\n'''AlphaOne:''' Thanks a bunch! Some\
      \ of the code did have a native class declaration. I didn't realise that someonelse's\
      \ file was in the package, so I didn't bother to look there until I searched\
      \ for the word \"native\" in ALL of my classes! Anyways, UMake is a wonderful\
      \ program!\n\n'''Ferazel2001:''' Wow... im so glad theres an alternitave to\
      \ UDE... I thought I was stuck with either that or UnrealEd, Now that I have\
      \ gotten EditPlus and UMake set up, life is really looking up! Thanks for the\
      \ great app!\n\n===Code===\n\n'''Blip2:''' Was this written in VB5/6/ or .net?\n\
      \n'''Wormbo:''' It was written in Delphi. No idea about the version, though."
