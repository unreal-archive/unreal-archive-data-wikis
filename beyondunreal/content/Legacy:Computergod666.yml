      <p>2 Feb 2007</p>\n<p>Vehicles for Unreal Tournament. Wouldn't that be a nice\
      \ thing? How about vehicles that you can mount user-controllable turrets (or\
      \ any other actor) on? All who agree, please let me know and I will send you\
      \ my latest script package... Not really. I just finished a user-controllable\
      \ turret for UT. So I could attach things to it realistically, I had to create\
      \ my own mover subclass because the Attach Mover is a failure, at least on my\
      \ computer. So I created a turret. I'm working on a vehicle class for which\
      \ you can specify whether it's a land vehicle (goes on land, falls if it's in\
      \ the air, sinks in water), water vehicle (doesn't go on land, falls out of\
      \ the air, and sinks in water), a hovercraft (goes on land, falls if it's in\
      \ the air, floats on water), an airplane-type flight vehicle (strafing and rise/sink\
      \ disabled, falls if its velocity is too low), or a helicopter-type flight vehicle\
      \ (can strafe and rise or sink, and hovers). You will be able to attach any\
      \ kind of actor to it! I can't wait...</p>\n<p>29 Jan 2007</p>\n<p>In 30 minutes\
      \ last night, I made a pickup with similar functionality to the CRYSIS nanotech\
      \ suit. Like the original nanosuit, it regenerates health. It has four modes:\
      \ Strength (doubles your damage), Speed (Multiplies your speeds by 1.5 and doubles\
      \ your JumpZ), Health (regenerates 2 points health per second instead of 1),\
      \ and Cloak (invisibility). I was going to do an Armor mode, which would give\
      \ the player 1 point armor per second AND 2 points health per second, but I\
      \ could only figure out how to do that if the player already had armor, so I\
      \ made it a simple health mode instead. I'm going to re-do this in the near\
      \ future. I made the nanosuit re-skin the player with the UT shield-belt textures,\
      \ so it looked like the player was wearing fancy force-fields or armor. The\
      \ problem with that is, you can't tell what team someone's on if they are wearing\
      \ the nanosuit! I'm going to fix this tonight.</p>\n<p>28 Jan 2007</p>\n<p>Over\
      \ the weekend...</p>\n<p>STICKY GRENADE LAUNCHER!!!</p>\n<p>Fire: launches a\
      \ grenade with a 10-second time limit. If it hits a player, it will attach to\
      \ the player and beep once every second. This gives people a fair warning if\
      \ they are going to be suicide-bombed.</p>\n<p>Alt Fire: launches a grenade\
      \ that sticks to anything that isn't alive, and blows up when it touches something\
      \ alive–like a trip mine. To be fair, you can shoot these trip mines apart (though\
      \ they have 50 health), and you can pick them up with the gravity gun. You can\
      \ then either throw them at your enemies or touch another mine with it to sweep\
      \ up both of them.</p>\n<p>Berserker pack</p>\n<p>Doom fans will recognize this.\
      \ It is basically a subclass of UDamage that increases your damage, doubles\
      \ your ground, water, and air speeds, and triples your jump height for 30 seconds.\
      \ (Please let me know if that sounds too long.)</p>\n<p>Classic Portal Gun</p>\n\
      <p>This portal gun works more like the original weapon from Portal. The Portals\
      \ are instant-hit, and you can manage each one separately: fire is a blue portal,\
      \ alt fire is an orange one. They look surprisingly like the original portals\
      \ except that you can't see through them (but I'm working on that.)</p>\n<p>24\
      \ Jan 2007</p>\n<p>I finally got my gravity guns to work properly. They include\
      \ angular velocity calculations, as I said, so you can pick up people with the\
      \ Enhanced Gravity Gun and smash them on the ground.&#160;:-)</p>\n<p>I also\
      \ finished a rather unusual weapon. I call it the \"Energy Disc\". the launcher\
      \ is basically the UT razorjack, but the disc is special. Here's how it works:</p>\n\
      <pre>-You only get one disc. If it has been fired, you can't fire again until\
      \ you get it back.\n-Primary fire causes the disc to collect energy from anything\
      \ it can. It will drain 20 points of health \n from anything that has health.\
      \ If it hits a wall, it returns to you.\n-You can power up the disc this way\
      \ to 400 points energy. If you fire the disc into a hazard,\n it will instantly\
      \ gain full power.\n-Alt fire causes the disc to give all its energy to anything\
      \ it hits that can take damage.\n At power levels above 200, the disc will cause\
      \ a shockwave each time it hits a wall.\n The disc will return to you after\
      \ you hit someone or if it bounces off more than two walls.\n-The disc is about\
      \ five times as fast as the razor blade, to make up for the fact that you get\
      \ only one.\n</pre>\n<p>The Splinter Machine was overpowered and the bots couldn't\
      \ use it, so I scrapped it in favor of this one.</p>\n<p>19 Jan 2007</p>\n<p>I\
      \ decided to recode all my weapons, using my own code in routines copied out\
      \ of TournamentWeapon. Now, they work and can be picked up properly.</p>\n<p>I\
      \ also decided to work on a gravity gun because I haven't made a melee weapon\
      \ to go with all my other weapons. At first, I wanted it to pick up and throw\
      \ objects around, but there isn't that much to throw in any of the original\
      \ UT maps, so I thought about allowing it to pick up and throw players. Well,\
      \ that isn't so good in a map like Facing Worlds. Therefore, I decided that\
      \ it will be able to pick up and throw only Decorations, Movers, and Projectiles.\
      \ (I want it to be able to throw the flags in CTF around too.) Primary fire\
      \ picks up an object, and alt fire throws it. I decided to make alt fire deal\
      \ some damage if the object is close enough. That way, it can be used as a melee\
      \ weapon that bots can use too.</p>\n<p>There will also be an \"Enhanced Gravity\
      \ Gun\" which has all the capabilities of the basic version, but it can also\
      \ pick up and throw people! So you can throw them off the asteroid in Facing\
      \ Worlds, or just smack them into a wall somewhere. If you aim it at level geometry,\
      \ you can pick YOURSELF up and swing around that point. There are some rudimentary\
      \ angular velocity calculations so you can do some Spider-Man-like tricks with\
      \ it. This version will be like the InstaGib rifle: it will have its own special\
      \ mutator, and will not appear in any maps as a pickup, because it's just too\
      \ powerful of a weapon.</p>\n<p>I also got my mutator to work properly. Now,\
      \ if you use it, you start out with a Dispersion Pistol, a Portal Gun, and a\
      \ Gravity Gun.</p>\n<p>18 Jan 2007</p>\n<p>Funny thing I just noticed about\
      \ my weapons. The ones that are 'from scratch' (Subclasses of TournamentWeapon')\
      \ never become pickup items! You can't kill someone and take their SRME, Nemesis,\
      \ Quad Shot, Portal Gun, etc. Is there special code for making an item become\
      \ a pickup? And where is it implemented?</p>\n<p>Sticky grenade launcher anyone?\
      \ That's my WIP right now.</p>\n<p>17 Jan 2007</p>\n<p>I DID IT! UT now has\
      \ a fully functional Portal Gun! It works basically the same as the original\
      \ gun from VALVe's game \"Portal\", but there are a few differences which I\
      \ implemented because what I did was really the easiest way I knew. Here are\
      \ some specs:</p>\n<p>Fire: Launch up to two Portals. These portals are automatically\
      \ connected to each other. If you try firing more than two portals, the gun\
      \ won't do anything.</p>\n<p>Alt Fire: Clean up all your existing portals.</p>\n\
      <pre>  Portals will stick to any solid surface (not movers or barrels), and\
      \ they will also stick to players. For example, you can fire one portal, stick\
      \ it to an enemy, then fire the other into a hazard. He will be teleported into\
      \ the hazard. Perhaps a better way to handle that would be to fire one portal\
      \ into the hazard FIRST, then shoot your enemy, then clean up, because you can\
      \ teleport to a portal while it is flying. If portals contact a teleporter or\
      \ WarpZone, they will become locked in a dimensional paradox loop: The teleporter\
      \ or WarpZone will try to teleport the Portal at the same time as the Portal\
      \ is trying to teleport the Teleporter. This is resolved by an immense release\
      \ of energy and the destruction of the portal.\n  Portals can teleport players,\
      \ barrels, and projectiles. Of course, if you fire the Shock Rifle at a portal,\
      \ it won't teleport the beam because that's a hitscan attack.\n  This gun does\
      \ not take ammunition. It cannot rapid fire. Projectile speed is supposed to\
      \ be 10000 units per second. It is impossible to fire a portal into a space\
      \ that is too small to fit in, because the portal has the same collision box\
      \ as a player.\n  Now, I'm trying to make a mutator where the player starts\
      \ off with a portal gun instead of a translocator, AND a sidearm which is not\
      \ the enforcer. Anyone can help?\n</pre>\n<p>16 Jan 2007</p>\n<p>Gave the Unreal\
      \ Quadshot some code. It now works like a real shotgun. Its stopping power,\
      \ sound, and firing modes led me to name it the \"Anti-Son-Of-A-Bitch machine.\"\
      </p>\n<pre>Fire: A single 12-gauge shotgun shell. 20 pellets, good accuracy,\
      \ 5 points damage per pellet. If you blow this in someone's face, it will turn\
      \ them into bloody hunks of meat.\nAlt Fire: Four shells, one after the other,\
      \ auto-shotgun style. I need some help on this part because overuse of the alt\
      \ fire causes the gun to, ahem, jam. After that, you can't even switch weapons,\
      \ but you have to wait around and die before you can use your trigger finger\
      \ again. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING!\n</pre>\n<p>Everything before this point does\
      \ not have a precise date. Some of my other weapons to this point:</p>\n<p>Air\
      \ Cannon: this weapon is only meant to knock people around and stop them from\
      \ firing at you.</p>\n<pre>Fire: harmless shockwave with a huge momentum transfer.\
      \ You can rocket jump about 100 feet with it.\nAlt fire: shockwave that causes\
      \ a concussion, but has no momentum transfer.\n</pre>\n<p>Splinter Machine:\
      \ a U238 powered weapon, replaces the Flak Cannon. Bots don't know how to use\
      \ it because both firing modes can spin up. This weapon has no killing power\
      \ of its own: you can't hurt someone by shooting them with it. It relies on\
      \ a small fission explosion to create shrapnel out of anything it hits, which\
      \ then does some serious damage. It doesn't work with humans because human splinters\
      \ just can't do enough damage.</p>\n<pre>Fire: Launches a fast-moving activated\
      \ U238 pellet, of variable size. It explodes on contact. One unit of ammo yields\
      \ a moderately annoying blast. Ten units yields one twice the size of a hand\
      \ grenade.\nAlt Fire: Launches a similar pellet, but it bounces around corners\
      \ until it hits a player. Same blast statistics as for the other pellet.\n</pre>\n\
      <p>Flechette Cannon: If you like watching people stuck full of darts, twitching,\
      \ screaming, and bleeding all over the place, this is your favorite weapon.</p>\n\
      <pre>Fire: Launches toxic darts minigun-style. Each dart does a total of 10\
      \ points damage, 2 points at a time. I was so proud of myself when I got the\
      \ darts to stick in players realistically.\nAlt Fire: Launches 10 darts, shotgun\
      \ style.\n</pre>\n<p>NEMESIS: my replacement for the Redeemer. I can't make\
      \ my own models for UT because gmax development has been discontinued, but I\
      \ wanted a model that made it obvious this gun was fusion powered.</p>\n<pre>Fire:\
      \ Sprays out explosive energy packets. One is enough to kill a person, but this\
      \ sprays 10 at a time. Makes for a really nice explosion noise.\nAlt Fire: Launches\
      \ a slow-moving energy grenade whose explosion is comparable to the Redeemer\
      \ shell (actually, it's twice as big, but the shell is twice as easy to hit),\
      \ and sprays out 20 energy packets.\n</pre>\n<p>Shrink Ray/Microwave Expander:\
      \ Hail to the chief, baby. A friend of mine suggested that I code a weapon similar\
      \ to the one(s) from Duke Nukem, so I did.</p>\n<pre>Fire: projectile shrinks\
      \ your enemy for 30 seconds and ensures that his health stays far enough down\
      \ that you can jump on him and smash him...if you can jump high enough. Unfortunately,\
      \ I wasn't able to change the player's collision cylinder.\nAlt Fire: projectile\
      \ attaches to player, inflating him over the course of 10 seconds, at the end\
      \ of which, he explodes.\n</pre>\n<p>Dispersion Pistol: I needed my own sidearm\
      \ to go with all the weapons I'm making, so this was it. When I ported it from\
      \ Unreal, I thought it didn't seem like such a good idea to put weapon power-ups\
      \ in a map. Therefore, I made all five power levels accessible by holding down\
      \ the trigger. Unfortunately, this means that Bots don't like it.</p>\n\n<!--\

      \ two Portals. These portals are automatically connected to each other. If you\
      \ try firing more than two portals, the gun won't do anything.\n\nAlt Fire:\
      \ Clean up all your existing portals.\n   Portals will stick to any solid surface\
      \ (not movers or barrels), and they will also stick to players. For example,\
      \ you can fire one portal, stick it to an enemy, then fire the other into a\
      \ hazard. He will be teleported into the hazard. Perhaps a better way to handle\
      \ that would be to fire one portal into the hazard FIRST, then shoot your enemy,\
      \ then clean up, because you can teleport to a portal while it is flying. If\
      \ portals contact a teleporter or WarpZone, they will become locked in a dimensional\
      \ paradox loop: The teleporter or WarpZone will try to teleport the Portal at\
      \ the same time as the Portal is trying to teleport the Teleporter. This is\
      \ resolved by an immense release of energy and the destruction of the portal.\n\
      \   Portals can teleport players, barrels, and projectiles. Of course, if you\
      \ fire the Shock Rifle at a portal, it won't teleport the beam because that's\
      \ a hitscan attack.\n   This gun does not take ammunition. It cannot rapid fire.\
      \ Projectile speed is supposed to be 10000 units per second. It is impossible\
      \ to fire a portal into a space that is too small to fit in, because the portal\
      \ has the same collision box as a player.\n   Now, I'm trying to make a mutator\
      \ where the player starts off with a portal gun instead of a translocator, AND\
      \ a sidearm which is not the enforcer. Anyone can help?\n\n16 Jan 2007\n\nGave\
      \ the Unreal Quadshot some code. It now works like a real shotgun. Its stopping\
      \ power, sound, and firing modes led me to name it the \"Anti-Son-Of-A-Bitch\
      \ machine.\"\n Fire: A single 12-gauge shotgun shell. 20 pellets, good accuracy,\
      \ 5 points damage per pellet. If you blow this in someone's face, it will turn\
      \ them into bloody hunks of meat.\n Alt Fire: Four shells, one after the other,\
      \ auto-shotgun style. I need some help on this part because overuse of the alt\
      \ fire causes the gun to, ahem, jam. After that, you can't even switch weapons,\
      \ but you have to wait around and die before you can use your trigger finger\
      \ again. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING!\n\nEverything before this point does not have\
      \ a precise date. Some of my other weapons to this point:\n\nAir Cannon: this\
      \ weapon is only meant to knock people around and stop them from firing at you.\n\
      \ Fire: harmless shockwave with a huge momentum transfer. You can rocket jump\
      \ about 100 feet with it.\n Alt fire: shockwave that causes a concussion, but\
      \ has no momentum transfer.\n\nSplinter Machine: a U238 powered weapon, replaces\
      \ the Flak Cannon. Bots don't know how to use it because both firing modes can\
      \ spin up. This weapon has no killing power of its own: you can't hurt someone\
      \ by shooting them with it. It relies on a small fission explosion to create\
      \ shrapnel out of anything it hits, which then does some serious damage. It\
      \ doesn't work with humans because human splinters just can't do enough damage.\n\
      \ Fire: Launches a fast-moving activated U238 pellet, of variable size. It explodes\
      \ on contact. One unit of ammo yields a moderately annoying blast. Ten units\
      \ yields one twice the size of a hand grenade.\n Alt Fire: Launches a similar\
      \ pellet, but it bounces around corners until it hits a player. Same blast statistics\
      \ as for the other pellet.\n\nFlechette Cannon: If you like watching people\
      \ stuck full of darts, twitching, screaming, and bleeding all over the place,\
      \ this is your favorite weapon.\n Fire: Launches toxic darts minigun-style.\
      \ Each dart does a total of 10 points damage, 2 points at a time. I was so proud\
      \ of myself when I got the darts to stick in players realistically.\n Alt Fire:\
      \ Launches 10 darts, shotgun style.\n\nNEMESIS: my replacement for the Redeemer.\
      \ I can't make my own models for UT because gmax development has been discontinued,\
      \ but I wanted a model that made it obvious this gun was fusion powered.\n Fire:\
      \ Sprays out explosive energy packets. One is enough to kill a person, but this\
      \ sprays 10 at a time. Makes for a really nice explosion noise.\n Alt Fire:\
      \ Launches a slow-moving energy grenade whose explosion is comparable to the\
      \ Redeemer shell (actually, it's twice as big, but the shell is twice as easy\
      \ to hit), and sprays out 20 energy packets.\n\nShrink Ray/Microwave Expander:\
      \ Hail to the chief, baby. A friend of mine suggested that I code a weapon similar\
      \ to the one(s) from Duke Nukem, so I did.\n Fire: projectile shrinks your enemy\
      \ for 30 seconds and ensures that his health stays far enough down that you\
      \ can jump on him and smash him...if you can jump high enough. Unfortunately,\
      \ I wasn't able to change the player's collision cylinder.\n Alt Fire: projectile\
      \ attaches to player, inflating him over the course of 10 seconds, at the end\
      \ of which, he explodes.\n\nDispersion Pistol: I needed my own sidearm to go\
      \ with all the weapons I'm making, so this was it. When I ported it from Unreal,\
      \ I thought it didn't seem like such a good idea to put weapon power-ups in\
      \ a map. Therefore, I made all five power levels accessible by holding down\
      \ the trigger. Unfortunately, this means that Bots don't like it.\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
