      \ all and increase the drawscale.</li>\n<li>Following the flow of the terrain,\
      \ roads, paths or open areas I space my FPNs out adding two or three at a time.\
      \ Once I have several nodes in place, I select all and in the sideview window\
      \ (you may prefer the dynamic window) I raise then up until they are above my\
      \ meshes, cliffs, or whatever height I want to use as a starting point. Be careful\
      \ not to raise your FPNs above your StallZ line (<a href=\"/Legacy:StallZ\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:StallZ\">StallZ</a>). <a href=\"/Legacy:Rebuild\" title=\"\

      \ Caption Context Menu\">Viewport Caption Context Menu</a> -&gt; Actors -&gt;\
      \ Radii View. Now select one of your FPNs (here is where the larger drawscale\

      \ nodes, hence navigating your map, node radii circles <i>must</i> overlap.\
      \ If you have radii circles that do not overlap, you will need to add in additional\
      \ FPNs. Sometimes raising your FPNs will increase the radii, which is directly\
