      \n===Basics===\n\nAn actor's collision can be set to ''block'' others or ''collide''\
      \ with them.\n\n; Block : An actor which blocks prevents other actors from entering\
      \ its cylinder. Monsters, bots, players and some kinds of decoration can't be\
      \ walked into and feel solid to the player. \n\n; Collide : An actor which collides\
      \ allows other actors to pass through its cylinder, but will be affected by\
      \ this. For example: a player can walk through a weapon pickup actor. The pickup\
      \ will make itself disappear and act upon the player to make him receive a weapon.\
      \ Another example: triggers send out an [[Legacy:Event|event]] to other actors.\
      \ What happens for both the trigger and the pickup is that the engine calls\

      \ Some decoration is set to this behaviour, for example the pipe decorations.\

      \ block. : Nothing is called.\n; One of the actors collides, the other blocks\
      \ or collides. : Both actors have Touch() called.\n; Both actors block. : Both\
      \ actors have Bump() called. Moving actors also have HitWall() called.\n\nNote\
      \ that behaviour is also dependent on the presence in the actor's class script\
      \ of Bump() or Touch() functions. Actors such as [[Legacy:Light (UT)|Light (UT)]]\
