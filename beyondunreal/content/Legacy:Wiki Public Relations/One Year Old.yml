      \ Page\">Unreal Wiki</a> is one year old today.</p>\n<p>This site, the community\
      \ equivalent of the Unreal Developer Network (UDN), now has over 1500 pages\
      \ written by over 150 contributors. It covers editing, mapping and scripting\
      \ for Unreal Tournament 2003 and the <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_Engine\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Unreal Engine\">Unreal Engine</a> in general.</p>\n<p>Topic pages, <a\
      \ href=\"/Category:Legacy_Category\" title=\"Category:Legacy Category\">category\
      \ schemes</a> and the site's <a href=\"/Legacy:Search\" title=\"Legacy:Search\"\
      >search</a> engine will help you find what you need in this vast quantity of\
      \ information, whether it's the basics of how to get started or advanced topics\
      \ such as BSP trees. Find pages on subjects like the syntax and compiling of\
      \ UnrealScript all the way to examples of mod and mapper journals. Read up on\
      \ map design techniques and find out how to use movers and triggers, and how\
      \ to bot-path your level effectively.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_FAQ\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Wiki FAQ\">Wiki</a> system allows anyone to edit pages and\
      \ add material. Because everyone can add their own information, tips, tricks,\
      \ and corrections at any time, the site grows quickly. You can freely participate\
      \ in discussions on mod ideas for UT2003, and even better, you can become a\
      \ contributor by adding your own information to the site. Plug-in sidebars for\
      \ the popular browsers allow you to keep up with the site's fast-changing content\
      \ and hold your favourite bookmarks. The site also integrates into mIRC, converting\
      \ page names into direct URLs.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Sent&#160;:)</dd>\n</dl>\n<hr\
