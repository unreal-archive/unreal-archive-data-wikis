      <p>If you have broadband and your machine is usually online you can run a server\
      \ from a batch file that has a short-cut in your startup folder. Then everytime\
      \ you reboot your server goes back up and is online.</p>\n<p>You can get a copy\
      \ of the UTServerOnly436.zip from <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\"\
      \ href=\"http://unreal.epicgames.com/tournamentversions.htm\">http://unreal.epicgames.com/tournamentversions.htm</a>.\
      \ You can download updates for the server from <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external free\" href=\"http://utpg.org/\">http://utpg.org/</a>, but I've heard\
      \ somepeople say that they cannot connect to the 4.51 version.) Run it from\
      \ its own folder. It will not conflict with your regular game unless you have\
      \ it on when you play and someone hit's your test server, then you might notice\
      \ the cpu usage limiting you in your game (I turn my test server off when I\
      \ play online).</p>\n<p>Accessing this test server from your regular UT installation\
      \ should give you a pretty good test as it will go out on the internet to come\
      \ back and connect to the server. Getting rid of all files needed to join the\
      \ server from your UT Dir will force you to download them upon joining. This\
      \ will ensure the purity of the test (I don't think that would work very well\
      \ if you were running the dedicated server from your regular installation&#160;;P\
      \ ).</p>\n<p>Note: If you have been working on your mod, map, whatever, and\
      \ updating your test server, you may have junk in your server's ini file. Maybe\
      \ you run 2 or 3 parts of your mod for testing and now your running the whole\
      \ mod.. make sure you've edited out ServerPackages lines or ServerActors lines\
      \ that you know longer use... otherwise it will make testers download a lot\
      \ of junk they don't need.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Testers\"\

      \ still seems like a great idea though. Too bad it wasn't a bit more... popular.</p>\n\

      \ is as Saragon pointed out that he wasn't getting feedback, but that's probably\
      \ due to the lack of usage of this page to begin with. I wish i had checked\
      \ here in time to try it out. I'll check back here more often, I like show and\

      \ tools.</p>\n<p><b>VitalOverdose</b>..is this page for testing servers only?\
      \ the links to here are for 'get people to test your mod' etc?</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b>\

      \ but I've heard somepeople say that they cannot connect to the 4.51 version.)\
      \ Run it from its own folder. It will not conflict with your regular game unless\
      \ you have it on when you play and someone hit's your test server, then you\
      \ might notice the cpu usage limiting you in your game (I turn my test server\
      \ off when I play online).\n\nAccessing this test server from your regular UT\
      \ installation should give you a pretty good test as it will go out on the internet\
      \ to come back and connect to the server. Getting rid of all files needed to\
      \ join the server from your UT Dir will force you to download them upon joining.\
      \ This will ensure the purity of the test (I don't think that would work very\
      \ well if you were running the dedicated server from your regular installation\
      \ ;P ).\n\nNote: If you have been working on your mod, map, whatever, and updating\
      \ your test server, you may have junk in your server's ini file. Maybe you run\
      \ 2 or 3 parts of your mod for testing and now your running the whole mod..\
      \ make sure you've edited out ServerPackages lines or ServerActors lines that\
      \ you know longer use... otherwise it will make testers download a lot of junk\
      \ they don't need.\n\n==Testers==\n\nI'm sure this page will be lots of fun\
      \ for people to come and just check out the works in progress. I don't think\
      \ these servers will ever get so populated as for that to be a problem. But,\
      \ please don't jump in and start shooting if some else is there testing. They\
      \ maybe in the middle of examing an area where they thought they saw a sparkle\
      \ of BSP hole or trying to find the exact spot where they went through an unintended\
      \ warp.\n\nRead the Analyz section before you join. There may be a request that\
      \ you don't use certain features such as chat or other instructions. These servers\
      \ feature works in progress and may be delicate at this stage.\n\nTo be the\
      \ best help you can be, please take a moment and visit [[Legacy:A Bug'S Life|A\
      \ Bug's Life]]. This will be much more an informal statement of your findings\
      \ but there is information there that will help you contribute good and usefull\

      \ are welcome here. And I would sure like to see more servers here, even if\
      \ you just put up one for viewers' interest. Would be nice to see any models\
      \ you have made even check out your maps. C'mon, its show and tell time! =P\n\
      \n'''Sir Sargon:''' Well, my test server had a nice short run up here... But\
      \ it seems the time frame that free beta testers take to gravitate to a test\
      \ server is a bit, uhm, long for my tastes. So I just punched HolyWarsV4 up\
      \ to release version without any real beta testing done by others. This page\
      \ still seems like a great idea though. Too bad it wasn't a bit more... popular.\n\
      \nGuest: Why dont people use this page, it's a good \n\nidea for a list of testing\
      \ servers.\n\n'''CH3Z:''' Well, i wonder too hehe Part of it is as Saragon pointed\
      \ out that he wasn't getting feedback, but that's probably due to the lack of\
      \ usage of this page to begin with. I wish i had checked here in time to try\
      \ it out. I'll check back here more often, I like show and tell.\n\n'''sweavo:'''\
      \ maybe give it a more interesting name like \"Try my server\" or \"play this!\"\
      \ ... testing lab didn't inspire me when it showed up in the recent changes.\
      \  I clicked on it thinking it was some debug tools.\n\n'''VitalOverdose'''..is\
      \ this page for testing servers only? the links to here are for 'get people\
      \ to test your mod' etc?\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Say you've created a mutator and\
      \ you want to see if it works online, you can post the Server here and get feedback\
      \ from people."
