      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Red_Builder_Brush\" title=\"Legacy:Red Builder Brush\">red\
      \ builder brush</a> into a cube, 64 units in width and breadth, and 32 in height.\
      \ This will be our light shape.</li>\n<li>Once you have created the light shape,\
      \ add it to our world as a <a href=\"/Legacy:Semisolid\" title=\"Legacy:Semisolid\"\
      >Semisolid</a>. The easiest way to do this is to use the <a href=\"/Legacy:Add_Special\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Add Special\">Add Special</a> option in the brush menu and\
      \ change the <i>prefabs drop list</i> to <i>Semisolid Pillar</i>. Once you've\
      \ done that, you can press the <i>OK</i> button to add it to your level.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>When you press the add button you will see a pinkish brush\
      \ get added to your level.</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>Now that you've added the\
      \ light object you need to move it into position (level with the ceiling) and\
      \ texture it. You may find the <a href=\"/Legacy:Decorating_Rooms_With_Textures\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Decorating Rooms With Textures\">Decorating Rooms With Textures</a>\
      \ a handy reference at this point. We are going to place four lights in each\
      \ room so make sure you leave room to evenly space them around the room.</li>\n\
      <li>Once you have textured the light to your satisfaction we'll move it into\
      \ position. I used <i>RCLFTRM3</i> in the Trim texture group of UTtech2 for\
      \ the sides of the light, and <i>RCLFLIT1XY</i> in the Light group of UTtech2\
      \ for the light itself. We also need to set the light texture to <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Special_Lit\" title=\"Legacy:Special Lit\">Special Lit</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd>The reason we set the light texture to \"special lit\" is to give\
      \ us greater control over how the light looks. By setting the special lit property\
      \ of the light we can control the light within the room, and the light that\
      \ shines on the light texture itself independently. This is a good thing. You\
      \ should have something like the picture below.</dd>\n</dl>\n<div class=\"center\"\

      \ We have our light shape, we've got it nicely textured and it looks lovely\
      \ sitting on our ceiling. If you've moved the light geometry object then rebuild\
      \ the geometry before continuing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the 3D view right click\
      \ on the light texture and select the <i>Add Light Here</i> option.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd>You will see a little torch icon appear as if by magic. This is our\
      \ light object.</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>In one of the side views move the light\
      \ you just added down so that it's around 196 units (1.5 big squares) below\
      \ the ceiling. You can do this by clicking once on the torch (it should go green),\
      \ holding down the Shift key and dragging (keep the left mouse button down)\
      \ the torch shape downwards.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you have move the light\
      \ into position, add another light in the same way as the first, but don't move\
      \ it.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>From a side view you should now see your light,\
      \ below that the second light you added, and below that the first light you\
      \ added. There's a picture below.</dd>\n</dl>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div\

      \ width=\"412\" height=\"415\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Select the highest\
      \ light, and right click on it. Select the <i>Light Properties</i> option (it's\
      \ at the top). A big scary window will pop up from nowhere. Open up the <i>Lighting</i>\
      \ group and set the <i>bSpecialLit</i> value to true, and the <i>LightRadius</i>\
      \ to 32.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>This will cause this light to only affect surfaces\
      \ within it's radius that have a surface flag of <i>special lit</i>.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<ul>\n<li>Now open the <i>LightColor</i> group and set the <i>LightBrightness</i>\
      \ to 196. This is going to be the colour of the light texture.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd>You can now use the <i>rebuild lighting</i> tool to build the lights\
      \ within the level. If you are lazy like I am, you can rebuild everything in\
      \ the level all in one go using the <i>build all</i> tool.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span\

      Edit section: Step 3: One light is not enough\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>OK, so we've built a light shape and lit it with two\
      \ lights. That's not enough, we need lots of lights. In fact, we are going to\
      \ create four lights per room.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In either the side or front view\
      \ select both lights and your light geometry object (or brush). You can do this\
      \ by holding down the <i>Control</i> key and Left clicking each of the objects\
      \ in turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>The light objects (torches) should be green.\
      \ The light brush should be pink (because it's a Semisolid).</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>Now right click on any of the objects and select the <i>Duplicate</i> option.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>You should see a new brush and two new lights appear - selected.\
      \ Move the objects into an appropriate position within your room. When they\
      \ are in position duplicate them again. Remember, we want 4 lights per room.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<ul>\n<li>Once you have your four lights positioned nicely rebuild everything\
      \ using the <i>build all</i> toolbar icon. You may have noticed that the <i>Duplicate</i>\
      \ option didn't affect the displayed geometry in the 3D view.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd>The first thing you will notice is that it's awfully bright in there.\
      \ The floor looks completely washed out. In game, the level will look even brighter.\
      \ We need to do something about that.</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>Select all four\
      \ of the lower lights you have created and set their brightness to 24 (hint:\
      \ we changed the light brightness above).</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>That should\
      \ look much better now. It may look a little dark. Don't worry, in game things\
      \ appear slightly brighter than they do in the editor. If you find that the\
      \ brightness of the light texture changes when you do this it means you haven't\
      \ set the <i>SpecialLit</i> property of the texture. Do this now and then rebuild\
      \ everything again.</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>Now we have lit one room, duplicate\
      \ your four lights (brush and two torches apiece) and add them to the other\
      \ three rooms.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>You should now have four beautifully lit\
      \ rooms. Feel free to take a room and play around with the different lighting\
      \ effects. But to be honest, it's best left till we've added some player starts.\
      \ Which is the next tutorial.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\
      That.27s_It\">That's It</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: That's It\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Well done. You've managed to complete the third part\
      \ of the tutorial. Hopefully you'll be looking at a four room map with corridors\
      \ joining the rooms, complete with lights. Even though we have done all this\
      \ we still haven't got a level that we can play around in. Don't worry though.\
      \ We will get there. I'm not one for making things too easy, and running around\
      \ in the square box is pretty dull anyway.</p>\n<p>At this point it's worth\
      \ saving the map. Use the <i>File -&gt; Save</i> to save the level over the\
      \ top of your previous version. You can save it under a different name if you\
      \ like. Remember the <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Goblin\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Goblin\">UnrealEd Goblin</a> likes to crash the editor on the regular basis\
      \ so save little and often if you are planning on doing a lot of work in the\
      \ editor.</p>\n<p>You are now ready to move on to <a href=\"/Legacy:Creating_DM-Quadroid/PlayerStarts\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Creating DM-Quadroid/PlayerStarts\">Creating DM-Quadroid/PlayerStarts</a>,\
      \ and add some player starts to the map. And then .... you can play it! See\
      \ you there.</p>\n<p>You can also see <a href=\"/Legacy:Lighting_Basics\" title=\"\

      \ You should have something like the picture below.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_dmquadroid-addlights1.gif|center|]]\n\
      \n====Step 2: Add the lights ====\n\nWe are now ready to add some lights - at\
      \ long last.  We have our light shape, we've got it nicely textured and it looks\
      \ lovely sitting on our ceiling.  If you've moved the light geometry object\
      \ then rebuild the geometry before continuing.\n* In the 3D view right click\
      \ on the light texture and select the ''Add Light Here'' option.\n: You will\
      \ see a little torch icon appear as if by magic.  This is our light object.\n\
      \n* In one of the side views move the light you just added down so that it's\
      \ around 196 units (1.5 big squares) below the ceiling.  You can do this by\
      \ clicking once on the torch (it should go green), holding down the Shift key\
      \ and dragging (keep the left mouse button down) the torch shape downwards.\n\
      \n* Once you have move the light into position, add another light in the same\
      \ way as the first, but don't move it.\n: From a side view you should now see\
      \ your light, below that the second light you added, and below that the first\
      \ light you added.  There's a picture below.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_dmquadroid-addlights2.gif|center|]]\n\
      \n* Select the highest light, and right click on it.  Select the ''Light Properties''\
      \ option (it's at the top).  A big scary window will pop up from nowhere.  Open\
      \ up the ''Lighting'' group and set the ''bSpecialLit'' value to true, and the\
      \ ''LightRadius'' to 32.\n: This will cause this light to only affect surfaces\
      \ within it's radius that have a surface flag of ''special lit''.\n\n* Now open\
      \ the ''LightColor'' group and set the ''LightBrightness'' to 196.  This is\
      \ going to be the colour of the light texture.\n: You can now use the ''rebuild\
      \ lighting'' tool to build the lights within the level.  If you are lazy like\
      \ I am, you can rebuild everything in the level all in one go using the ''build\
      \ all'' tool.\n\n====Step 3: One light is not enough ====\n\nOK, so we've built\
      \ a light shape and lit it with two lights.  That's not enough, we need lots\
      \ of lights.  In fact, we are going to create four lights per room.\n* In either\
      \ the side or front view select both lights and your light geometry object (or\
      \ brush).  You can do this by holding down the ''Control'' key and Left clicking\
      \ each of the objects in turn.\n: The light objects (torches) should be green.\
      \  The light brush should be pink (because it's a Semisolid).\n\n* Now right\
      \ click on any of the objects and select the ''Duplicate'' option.\n: You should\
      \ see a new brush and two new lights appear - selected.  Move the objects into\
      \ an appropriate position within your room.  When they are in position duplicate\
      \ them again.  Remember, we want 4 lights per room.\n\n*Once you have your four\
      \ lights positioned nicely rebuild everything using the ''build all'' toolbar\
      \ icon.  You may have noticed that the ''Duplicate'' option didn't affect the\
      \ displayed geometry in the 3D view.\n: The first thing you will notice is that\
      \ it's awfully bright in there.  The floor looks completely washed out.  In\
      \ game, the level will look even brighter.  We need to do something about that.\n\
      \n* Select all four of the lower lights you have created and set their brightness\
      \ to 24 (hint: we changed the light brightness above).\n: That should look much\
      \ better now.  It may look a little dark.  Don't worry, in game things appear\
      \ slightly brighter than they do in the editor.  If you find that the brightness\
      \ of the light texture changes when you do this it means you haven't set the\
      \ ''SpecialLit'' property of the texture.  Do this now and then rebuild everything\
      \ again.\n\n* Now we have lit one room, duplicate your four lights (brush and\
      \ two torches apiece) and add them to the other three rooms.\n: You should now\
      \ have four beautifully lit rooms.  Feel free to take a room and play around\
      \ with the different lighting effects.  But to be honest, it's best left till\
      \ we've added some player starts.  Which is the next tutorial.\n\n====That's\
      \ It ====\n\nWell done.  You've managed to complete the third part of the tutorial.\
      \  Hopefully you'll be looking at a four room map with corridors joining the\
      \ rooms, complete with lights.  Even though we have done all this we still haven't\
      \ got a level that we can play around in.  Don't worry though.  We will get\
      \ there.  I'm not one for making things too easy, and running around in the\
      \ square box is pretty dull anyway.\n\nAt this point it's worth saving the map.\
      \  Use the ''File -> Save'' to save the level over the top of your previous\
      \ version.  You can save it under a different name if you like.  Remember the\
      \ [[Legacy:UnrealEd Goblin|UnrealEd Goblin]] likes to crash the editor on the\
      \ regular basis so save little and often if you are planning on doing a lot\
      \ of work in the editor.\n\nYou are now ready to move on to [[Legacy:Creating\
      \ DM-Quadroid/PlayerStarts|Creating DM-Quadroid/PlayerStarts]], and add some\
      \ player starts to the map.  And then .... you can play it!  See you there.\n\
