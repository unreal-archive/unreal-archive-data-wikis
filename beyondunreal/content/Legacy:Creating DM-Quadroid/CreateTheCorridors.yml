      \ now to fix the height of those corridors. Players within the map cannot hope\

      \ floors of the corridors are way to high. In order to fix this we need to select\
      \ all of our corridor brushes (or cubes if you prefer) and move them down slightly.</li>\n\
      <li>Before we start, make sure the red builder brush is not covering any of\
      \ your corridor brushes (or cubes). Simply move it out of the way.</li>\n<li>Holding\
      \ down the control key, left click on each of the corridor brushes (or cubes)\
      \ displayed in the plan view of the map (top left if you are using the default\
      \ views). You should see them all highlight as you click on them.</li>\n<li>If\
      \ you now click <b>once</b> in the front view window you will see the brushes\

      \ Left mouse button and Left click on each of the views.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n\
      <dd>Hang on a minute! All of the views bar the 3D one are showing the corridors\
      \ in the correct place, flush with the floor. The 3D view still shows them raised\
      \ from the floor. This is because the 3D view shows the geometry as it was last\
      \ built. Direct adds and subtracts affect the build of the geometry, but moves\
      \ don't. Lets fix that now.</dd>\n</dl>\n<ul>\n<li>Click on the \"Build Geometry\"\
      \ icon (<i>insert pic here</i>) on the toolbar, or use \"Build -&gt; Rebuild\
      \ Geometry Only\" from the menu.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>You'll now see the 3D\
      \ view update itself and display the corridors flush with the floor.</dd>\n\

      <p>Well done. You've managed to complete the second part of the tutorial. Hopefully\
      \ you'll be looking at a four room map with corridors joining the rooms. The\

      \ haven't got a level that we can play around in.</p>\n<p>At this point it's\
      \ worth saving the map again. Use the <i>File -&gt; Save</i> to save the level\
      \ over the top of your previous version. You can save it under a different name\
      \ if you like. Remember the <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Goblin\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Goblin\">UnrealEd Goblin</a> likes to crash the editor on the regular basis\
      \ so save little and often if you are planning on doing a lot of work in the\
      \ editor.</p>\n<p>You are now ready to move on to <a href=\"/Legacy:Creating_DM-Quadroid/AddLights\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Creating DM-Quadroid/AddLights\">Creating DM-Quadroid/AddLights</a>,\
      \ and add some lights to the map. At least then we'll be able to see where we\
      \ are going. See you there.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage:\

    text: "==Tutorial: DM-Quadroid for UT &ndash; Building the Corridors ==\n\nIn\
      \ this part of the tutorial we are going to join our four rooms with four corridors.\
      \  In order to keep things simple we'll make the corridors all the same (although\
      \ you can texture them differently if you like).  In this part of the tutorial\
      \ you will cover the following\n* How to change the [[Legacy:Red Builder Brush|red\
      \ builder brush]] into a cube of a specified size.\n* How to create a corridor\
      \ using the \"subtract\" operation (see [[Legacy:CSG|CSG]] for more information).\n\
      * How to apply basic texturing.\n* Rebuild the geometry in the level.\n\n===Before\
      \ you Start ===\n\nBefore you start please make sure you have completed the\
      \ following steps:\n# Looked at the [[Legacy:Toolbox|Toolbox]] page so you are\
      \ familiar with the icons on the left hand side of the editor.\n# Completed\
      \ the first part of this tutorial [[Legacy:Creating Dm-Quadroid/CreateTheRooms|Creating\
      \ Dm-Quadroid/CreateTheRooms]].\n# Opened the Unreal Editor and loaded the saved\
      \ level.\n\n===A Quick Recap ===\n\nAt this stage of the tutorial we have created\
      \ four rooms of equal size and textured them.  We haven't added any lights or\
      \ player start positions yet so the level is not playable.\n\n===Building the\
      \ Rooms ===\n\n====Step 1: Create a corridor shape  ====\n* The first thing\
      \ to do is make the [[Legacy:Red Builder Brush|red builder brush]] the right\
      \ size.  Right click on the \"Cube\" icon (''insert cube icon here'') in the\
      \ tool box, and enter the values 256, 512, 256 for the height, width, and breadth\
      \ respectively, and press the build button.  This will give us our top/bottom\
      \ corridor shape.\n: You will see the size and shape of the red builder brush\
      \ change to the dimensions you have just specified.  Remember that the brush\
      \ won't change shape until you actually press the build button.  Now press the\
      \ '''Close''' button to get rid of the \"Cube\" properties window.\n\n* Using\
      \ Shift + the Left mouse button move your red builder brush such that it is\
      \ positioned as shown below.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_dmquadroid-createthecorridors1.gif|]]\n\
      \n====Step 2: Make the top/bottom corridors ====\n* Subtract the corridor shape\
      \ from the world.  Repeat the process on the other side of the level so the\
      \ two unconnected halves of your map are symmetrical.\n: You will have created\
      \ two corridors.  You will notice that the textures lining the floor, walls,\
      \ and ceiling of the corridor are textured using the last texture you selected,\
      \ or, the default texture.  You will also find that your corridors do not lie\
      \ flush with the floor if you never changed the height of the red builder brush\
      \ when making them.  Players would never be able to jump high enough to get\
      \ into them.  Don't worry - we'll fix that in a moment.\n\n====Step 3: Create\
      \ the left right corridors ====\n* Now we need to create the left/right corridor\
      \ shape.  You can either go back to the \"Cube\" properties window and enter\
      \ the values 256, 512 for the width and breadth respectively, or, you can rotate\
      \ the red builder brush by 90 degrees.  Personally I prefer to avoid rotations\
      \ as much as possible so I'd simply re-size the cube.  However, you can rotate\
      \ the \"Cube\" by ensuring that the \"Rotate\" icon ''insert pic here'' is selected,\
      \ holding down the Ctrl + Left mouse button, and moving the mouse left or right\
      \ until the brush is rotated by 90 degrees.\n* Once you have created the left/right\
      \ corridor shape move it into position such that it joins the two rooms.\n\n\
      * Once you have your left/right corridor shape in the right position subtract\
      \ it.  Make the lower half of the level a mirror image of the top half.\n* Now\
      \ texture your newly created corridors as you see fit.  Remember, you can use\
      \ ''Alt - Right click'' to make the texture of the surface clicked on the currently\
      \ selected texture.  And ''Alt - left click'' to apply the currently selected\
      \ texture to a surface.\n: Your level should now look similar to the one shown\
      \ below, albeit with texture differences.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_dmquadroid-createthecorridors2.gif|]]\n\
      \nIf you changed the height of your red builder brush when making the corridors\
      \ then you can skip this step.  If you didn't then read on.\n\n====Step 4: Fix\
      \ the height of the corridors ====\n* Right then, now to fix the height of those\
      \ corridors.  Players within the map cannot hope to travel between the different\
      \ rooms without using the hammer jump - the floors of the corridors are way\
      \ to high.  In order to fix this we need to select all of our corridor brushes\
      \ (or cubes if you prefer) and move them down slightly.\n* Before we start,\
      \ make sure the red builder brush is not covering any of your corridor brushes\
      \ (or cubes).  Simply move it out of the way.\n* Holding down the control key,\
      \ left click on each of the corridor brushes (or cubes) displayed in the plan\
      \ view of the map (top left if you are using the default views).  You should\
      \ see them all highlight as you click on them.\n* If you now click '''once'''\
      \ in the front view window you will see the brushes highlight themselves.  Changes\
      \ to objects within the different views only get updated when the view is selected.\n\
      * Holding down the Shift key and the Left mouse button, drag the mouse down.\
      \  You will see all of the brushes move down with the drag.  Once they are level\
      \ with the floor let go of the Left mouse button and Left click on each of the\
      \ views.\n: Hang on a minute!  All of the views bar the 3D one are showing the\
      \ corridors in the correct place, flush with the floor.  The 3D view still shows\
      \ them raised from the floor.  This is because the 3D view shows the geometry\
      \ as it was last built.  Direct adds and subtracts affect the build of the geometry,\
      \ but moves don't.  Lets fix that now.\n* Click on the \"Build Geometry\" icon\
      \ (''insert pic here'') on the toolbar, or use \"Build -> Rebuild Geometry Only\"\
      \ from the menu.\n: You'll now see the 3D view update itself and display the\
      \ corridors flush with the floor.\n\n====That's It ====\n\nWell done.  You've\
      \ managed to complete the second part of the tutorial.  Hopefully you'll be\
      \ looking at a four room map with corridors joining the rooms.  The corridors\
      \ should be flush with the floor and the map should be textured nicely in the\
      \ textures of your choice.  Even though we have done all this we still haven't\
      \ got a level that we can play around in.\n\nAt this point it's worth saving\
      \ the map again.  Use the ''File -> Save'' to save the level over the top of\
      \ your previous version.  You can save it under a different name if you like.\
      \  Remember the [[Legacy:UnrealEd Goblin|UnrealEd Goblin]] likes to crash the\
      \ editor on the regular basis so save little and often if you are planning on\
      \ doing a lot of work in the editor.\n\nYou are now ready to move on to [[Legacy:Creating\
      \ DM-Quadroid/AddLights|Creating DM-Quadroid/AddLights]], and add some lights\
      \ to the map.  At least then we'll be able to see where we are going.  See you\
      \ there."
