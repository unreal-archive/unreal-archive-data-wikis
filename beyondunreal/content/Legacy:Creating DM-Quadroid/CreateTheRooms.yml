      /Legacy:Red_Builder_Brush\" title=\"Legacy:Red Builder Brush\">red builder brush</a>\
      \ the right size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<div class=\"floatleft\"\

      ><img alt=\"Legacy interface.toolbox.defbuilders.gif\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_interface.toolbox.defbuilders.gif\"\
      \ width=\"68\" height=\"180\" /></a></div>\n<p>Right click on the \"Cube\" icon,\
      \ which is the top left icon in the toolbox (shown left). This will display\
      \ a small dialog box that allows you to enter the properties of the \"cube\"\
      \ that will be created the next time you <b>left click</b> on the Cube icon.</p>\n\
      <p>Enter the values 512, 1024, and 1024 for the height, width, breadth respectively,\
      \ and then click on the <b>Build</b> button.</p>\n<p>You will see the size and\
      \ shape of the red builder brush change to the dimensions you have just specified.\
      \ Notice that the brush didn't change shape until you actually pressed the build\
      \ button.</p>\n<p>You can now press the <b>Close</b> button to close the dialog\
      \ box.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The shape that we have created doesn't look like\
      \ much. It's simply a red wireframe box. In order to create a room in our solid\
      \ universe we need to subtract some space out. Which is what we'll do next.</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Create a room by \"subtracting\" the red builder brush shape from\
      \ the world. You can do this by <i>left mouse-clicking</i> on the 3D view in\
      \ the lower left quater of the screen and performing any one of the following\
      \ three actions:\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the \"Subtract\" icon in the operations\
      \ toolbox group on the left</li>\n<li>Use the <i>Ctrl-S</i> keyboard shortcut</li>\n\
      <li>Select <i>Brush -&gt; Subtract</i> from the menu bars at the top of the\
      \ screen.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As if by magic you will see a rather\
      \ unpleasant looking cube appear in space. This is your first room. Feel free\
      \ to look around it in the 2D and 3D views (see <a href=\"/Legacy:Mouse_Control\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mouse Control\">Mouse Control</a> if you've forgotten how).\
      \ Notice that the subtracted cube shows up as an icky brown/orange type colour.\
      \ This colour indicates that the cube (or brush in mapper speak)is a subtraction\
      \ form the world.</p>\n<p>You can see <a href=\"/Legacy:Subtract_A_Space\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Subtract A Space\">Subtract A Space</a> for more information on subtracting\
      \ cubes from the world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Right then, now that you've finished\
      \ playing around, it's time to create 3 more rooms. Using Shift + the Left mouse\
      \ button move your red builder brush (if the brush doesn't move then it isn't\
      \ selected) left until you have a gap of 512 units (4 of the large grey squares\
      \ if you've kept the default grid size) between the red builder brush and your\
      \ subtracted cube. Perform another subtract.</li>\n<li>Create two more rooms,\
      \ one above each of the two rooms to form a square of squares. Once you've done\
      \ that it should look like the picture below (plan view and 3d view shown).</li>\n\

      \ great, but you have to admit that they look pretty ugly. Lets make them look\
      \ nice. Before we do that read the following pages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Decorating_Rooms_With_Textures\" title=\"Legacy:Decorating Rooms With\
      \ Textures\">Decorating Rooms with Textures</a> page.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Mouse_Control\" title=\"Legacy:Mouse Control\">Mouse_Control</a> page,\
      \ specficially the <i>surface selection</i> section.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Done that?\
      \ Excellent. Lets get started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Browser\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Texture Browser\">Texture Browser</a> and load (File -&gt;\
      \ Open) the UTTech2.utx tecture package.</li>\n<li>Using the lower drop down\
      \ list (next to the <i>All</i> button) select the <i>Floor</i> group. From this\
      \ group of textures click on the tan looking one called \"RCLFFLR6X\".</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>At this point you can close (or minimise) the texture browser as we\
      \ have selected a texture. We'll need it again in a minute but if you don't\
      \ have a lot of screen real estate it's worth getting red of it.</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>In the 3D view port Alt + Left Click on the floors of each of your rooms.\
      \ Ta-da! We have a bit of colour.</li>\n<li>Now it's time to do the walls. Go\
      \ back into the Texture Browser and select the <i>Wall</i> group from the lower\
      \ drop list. Use the Alt-Left Click to texture the walls of the rooms. It's\
      \ worth selecting a different texture for each of the rooms, but do each room\
      \ in the same texture. I'll leave it up to you to decide which textures to use.</li>\n\
      <li>And finally, it's time to texture the ceiling. Select the <i>Ceiling</i>\
      \ group in the texture browser and pick a texture you like. Apply this in the\
      \ same way as you did all the other textures. You may find that you have to\
      \ move down and look up before you are able to see the faces that represent\
      \ the ceilings of the rooms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Well done. You've managed to complete the first part\
      \ of the tutorial. Hopefully you now know how to create rooms and texture them.\
      \ However, we still haven't got a level that we can play around in. Don't worry\
      \ though. We will get there. I'm not one for making things too easy, and running\
      \ around in a square box is pretty dull anyway.</p>\n<p>At this point it's worth\
      \ saving the map. Use the <i>File -&gt; Save As ..</i> menu option and use the\
      \ title DM-Quadroid. The <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Goblin\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Goblin\">UnrealEd Goblin</a> likes to crash the editor on the regular basis\
      \ so save little and often if you are planning on doing a lot of work in the\
      \ editor. It's not a bad idea to save the maps with version numbers (e.g. DM-Quadroid1\
      \ for the first save, DM-Quadroid2 for the second and so-on).</p>\n<p>You are\
      \ now ready to move on to <a href=\"/Legacy:Creating_DM-Quadroid/CreateTheCorridors\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Creating DM-Quadroid/CreateTheCorridors\">Creating DM-Quadroid/CreateTheCorridors</a>,\
      \ and add some corridors between the rooms. See you there.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ Why the lack of spaces in the page name?</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> Why not?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> ...because it's customary on the Unreal Wiki to use normal\
      \ spacing in page names. &#160;:-) I can rename those pages unless somebody\
      \ vividly objects.</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b> [Vividly objects]</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Since I'm <i>not</i> inclined to imagine your <i>argumentation</i> on that\
      \ part, I'd appreciate if you actually phrased it. &#160;;-)</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ I think it looks ugly with the names smashed together. It looks like WikiWiki,\
      \ MeatballWiki or Wikipedia. (all of which I consider to be ungodly, in appearance,\
      \ organization, and content for that matter)</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> The\
      \ lack of spaces in the names are merely an artifact of the time they were created.\
      \ It was an awful long time ago so if there was a method to it I forget what\

    text: "==Tutorial: DM-Quadroid for UT &ndash; Building the Rooms ==\n\nIn this\
      \ part of the tutorial we are going to create four rooms of an identical size.\
      \  These will form the main rooms of the level.  In this part of the tutorial\
      \ you will learn the following\n* How to change the [[Legacy:Red Builder Brush|red\
      \ builder brush]] into a cube of a specified size.\n* How to create a room using\
      \ the \"subtract\" operation (see [[Legacy:CSG|CSG]] for more information).\n\
      * How to apply basic texturing.\n\n===Before you Start ===\n\nBefore you start\
      \ please make sure you have completed the following steps:\n# Looked at the\
      \ [[Legacy:Toolbox|Toolbox]] page so you are familiar with the icons on the\
      \ left hand side of the editor.\n# Started the Unreal Editor.\n# Selected File\
      \ -> New (Or used Ctrl-N) to create a brand new level.\n\n===A Quick Recap ===\n\
      \nRemember, the world is solid.  In order to be able to run around in it we\
      \ need some space.  In order to create space we need to remove chunks of the\
      \ solid space (called subtracting).\n\n===Building the Rooms ===\n\n====Step\
      \ 1: Create the rooms ====\n* The first thing to do is make the [[Legacy:Red\
      \ Builder Brush|red builder brush]] the right size.\n\n\n\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface.toolbox.defbuilders.gif|left|]]\n\
      \nRight click on the \"Cube\" icon, which is the top left icon in the toolbox\
      \ (shown left).  This will display a small dialog box that allows you to enter\
      \ the properties of the \"cube\" that will be created the next time you '''left\
      \ click''' on the Cube icon.\n\nEnter the values 512, 1024, and 1024 for the\
      \ height, width, breadth respectively, and then click on the '''Build''' button.\n\
      \nYou will see the size and shape of the red builder brush change to the dimensions\
      \ you have just specified.  Notice that the brush didn't change shape until\
      \ you actually pressed the build button.\n\nYou can now press the '''Close'''\
      \ button to close the dialog box.\n\n\n\nThe shape that we have created doesn't\
      \ look like much.  It's simply a red wireframe box.  In order to create a room\
      \ in our solid universe we need to subtract some space out.  Which is what we'll\
      \ do next.\n\n* Create a room by \"subtracting\" the red builder brush shape\
      \ from the world.  You can do this by ''left mouse-clicking'' on the 3D view\
      \ in the lower left quater of the screen and performing any one of the following\
      \ three actions:\n*# Click on the \"Subtract\" icon in the operations toolbox\
      \ group on the left\n*# Use the ''Ctrl-S'' keyboard shortcut\n*# Select ''Brush\
      \ -> Subtract'' from the menu bars at the top of the screen.\n\nAs if by magic\
      \ you will see a rather unpleasant looking cube appear in space.  This is your\
      \ first room.  Feel free to look around it in the 2D and 3D views (see [[Legacy:Mouse\
      \ Control|Mouse Control]] if you've forgotten how).  Notice that the subtracted\
      \ cube shows up as an icky brown/orange type colour.  This colour indicates\
      \ that the cube (or brush in mapper speak)is a subtraction form the world.\n\
      \nYou can see [[Legacy:Subtract A Space|Subtract A Space]] for more information\
      \ on subtracting cubes from the world.\n\n* Right then, now that you've finished\
      \ playing around, it's time to create 3 more rooms.  Using Shift + the Left\
      \ mouse button move your red builder brush (if the brush doesn't move then it\
      \ isn't selected) left until you have a gap of 512 units (4 of the large grey\
      \ squares if you've kept the default grid size) between the red builder brush\
      \ and your subtracted cube.  Perform another subtract.\n* Create two more rooms,\
      \ one above each of the two rooms to form a square of squares.  Once you've\
      \ done that it should look like the picture below (plan view and 3d view shown).\n\
      \n[[Image:Legacy_dmquadroid-createtherooms1.gif|center|]]\n\n====Step 2: Add\
      \ some texture ====\n\nOK, we have four whole rooms, all to ourselves.  That's\
      \ great, but you have to admit that they look pretty ugly.  Lets make them look\
      \ nice.  Before we do that read the following pages:\n# The [[Legacy:Decorating\
      \ Rooms With Textures|Decorating Rooms with Textures]] page.\n# The [[Legacy:Mouse_Control|Mouse_Control]]\
      \ page, specficially the ''surface selection'' section.\n\nDone that?  Excellent.\
      \  Lets get started.\n* Open the [[Legacy:Texture Browser|Texture Browser]]\
      \ and load (File -> Open) the UTTech2.utx tecture package.\n* Using the lower\
      \ drop down list (next to the ''All'' button) select the ''Floor'' group.  From\
      \ this group of textures click on the tan looking one called \"RCLFFLR6X\".\n\
      \nAt this point you can close (or minimise) the texture browser as we have selected\
      \ a texture.  We'll need it again in a minute but if you don't have a lot of\
      \ screen real estate it's worth getting red of it.\n* In the 3D view port Alt\
      \ + Left Click on the floors of each of your rooms.  Ta-da! We have a bit of\
      \ colour.\n* Now it's time to do the walls.  Go back into the Texture Browser\
      \ and select the ''Wall'' group from the lower drop list.  Use the Alt-Left\
      \ Click to texture the walls of the rooms.  It's worth selecting a different\
      \ texture for each of the rooms, but do each room in the same texture.  I'll\
      \ leave it up to you to decide which textures to use.\n* And finally, it's time\
      \ to texture the ceiling.  Select the ''Ceiling'' group in the texture browser\
      \ and pick a texture you like.  Apply this in the same way as you did all the\
      \ other textures.  You may find that you have to move down and look up before\
      \ you are able to see the faces that represent the ceilings of the rooms.\n\n\
      ====That's It ====\n\nWell done.  You've managed to complete the first part\
      \ of the tutorial.  Hopefully you now know how to create rooms and texture them.\
      \  However, we still haven't got a level that we can play around in.  Don't\
      \ worry though.  We will get there.  I'm not one for making things too easy,\
      \ and running around in a square box is pretty dull anyway.\n\nAt this point\
      \ it's worth saving the map.  Use the ''File -> Save As ..'' menu option and\
      \ use the title DM-Quadroid.  The [[Legacy:UnrealEd Goblin|UnrealEd Goblin]]\
      \ likes to crash the editor on the regular basis so save little and often if\
      \ you are planning on doing a lot of work in the editor.  It's not a bad idea\
      \ to save the maps with version numbers (e.g. DM-Quadroid1 for the first save,\
      \ DM-Quadroid2 for the second and so-on).\n\nYou are now ready to move on to\
      \ [[Legacy:Creating DM-Quadroid/CreateTheCorridors|Creating DM-Quadroid/CreateTheCorridors]],\
      \ and add some corridors between the rooms.  See you there.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ Why the lack of spaces in the page name?\n\n'''Mosquito:''' Why not?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ ...because it's customary on the Unreal Wiki to use normal spacing in page\
      \ names.  :-)  I can rename those pages unless somebody vividly objects.\n\n\
      '''Mosquito:''' [Vividly objects]\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Since I'm ''not'' inclined\
      \ to imagine your ''argumentation'' on that part, I'd appreciate if you actually\
      \ phrased it.  ;-)\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I think it looks ugly with the names smashed\
      \ together. It looks like WikiWiki, MeatballWiki or Wikipedia. (all of which\
      \ I consider to be ungodly, in appearance, organization, and content for that\
      \ matter)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' The lack of spaces in the names are merely an\
      \ artifact of the time they were created.  It was an awful long time ago so\
      \ if there was a method to it I forget what it was.  Feel free to add spaces\
      \ or not as the mood takes you."
