      Legacy:Gametype\">gametype</a> in the Unreal engine game <a href=\"/Legacy:Devastation\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Devastation\">Devastation</a>.</p>\n<p>Even if you dont own\
      \ Devastation, I think this gametype could be a REALLY good mod for other games\
      \ (hinting at someone who knows how to mod games&#160;:Rolleyes:)</p>\n<p>For\
      \ those of you who have never heard of Territories, i will give you a quick\
      \ run-through. There are two teams, and each one has its own base.inside each\
      \ base is a spawning machine which brings you back to life when you are killed.\
      \ The base is protected by laser fences which will only open to let your team\
      \ through. The map has a coderoom located somewhere,containing a mainframe computer\
      \ which you use to download a special code into a handheld device. You then\
      \ have to 'hack' the enemy laser fences using the codes you have, vai a keypad\
      \ interact point at the fence. When the fence is disabled, you have to storm\
      \ the base and destroy the spawner so the enemy team will not be coming back.\
      \ you have won the game when all of the enemy has been killed. Weapons are obtained\
      \ by a loadout system. When you kill an enemy you recieve a amount of points\
      \ which you exchange for weapons and ammunition in a designated loadout volume\
      \ inside your base. Obvoiusly the less effective weapons (micro viper, 9mm SMG,\
      \ Handguns etc) are less expensive while the more effective weapons (Cobra cannon,\
      \ particle laser rifle, antique machine gun etc) are more expensive.</p>\n<p></p>\n\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It is very difficult to suggest a appropriate size\
      \ of map, it really all depends on how you want it to be played. If you want\
      \ fast-paced action go with a small map size (rivers of waste 2 or sniper IG-72\
      \ for example). This means that when you respawn you can get into the action\
      \ quickly, theres no trudging all-the-way-to-the-other-side-of-the-map just\
      \ to find people to kill. With a small map you must also consider that when\
      \ a fence is hacked, and you kill the incoming enemies they respawn and can\
      \ reach the open fence very quickly having not very far to go from thier base\
      \ to ours.</p>\n<p>This can result in a never ending stream of enemies continually\
      \ coming at your base and making defending very difficult.</p>\n<p>The final\
      \ consideration is the simplest- its a small map, which means things will become\
      \ crowded with more players. I myself have played a 6v6 clan war on rivers of\
      \ waste 2 (easily the smallest territories map out there) and it was absolute\
      \ chaos all the way through.</p>\n<p>If you want more out in the open combat\
      \ but you dont want your map to be too big so players can get back into action\
      \ in a reasonable time then you would be looking to scale your map along the\
      \ lines of DTT-Union or DTT-Nightforts or any of the other medium sized maps\
      \ out there. If you are really unsure of the size to make your map, choose to\
      \ make it just right- not too big or not too small. If you follow the scale\
      \ of the average map then you will get a map big enough for open air combat\
      \ and close up encounters....and of course SNIPING!!!! (one of my all time fauvorite\
      \ activities on any map in any game)</p>\n<p>REALLY big maps (DTT Fearzone scale)\
      \ demand much more tactical combat. And remember, in a huge map its a long journey\
      \ from your base to wherever the action is if you get killed. Also, if you get\
      \ killed after hacking a fence then theres no way at all you can make it back\
      \ to the enemy fence while it is still open, although this is a definite advantage\
      \ to the defending team who would not have to worry about repeat waves of attackers.</p>\n\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Theres an unwritten law that says territories maps\
      \ have to be completely symmetrical. This is not true. You will want to keep\
      \ your map roughly identical on each side to ensure no team has an advantage\
      \ over the other but it doesnt have to be excact. A good example of this is\
      \ DTT-DowntownChozo. on each side of the map there is a courtyard with elevated\
      \ walkways, a few small alleyways, and a large open street outside the base.\
      \ But the layout of the courtyards and bases are different,still though no team\
      \ has a particualry advantageous position over the other one. so when designing\
      \ a territories map you will be looking at a semi-symetrical layout, or of course\
      \ you could make it completely symetrical, eg like on rivers of waste 2.</p>\n\

      \ is more terrible than a map where there is only one passage from one side\
      \ through to the other. Chozo may be a balanced map, but it has a choke point\
      \ right at the two entrances into the coderoom. All everyone does in this map\
      \ is sit on the roofs and walkways and endlessly snipe you as you come to the\
      \ coderoom. Then everyone fills the place with smoke grenades and i get about\
      \ 3 FPS and cant see anything. So, make a choke point if you must, but be warned\

      \ all, although it is nice to have 2 matching bases. The position of the laser\
      \ fences is critical however. The last thing you want is a map where one base\
      \ is easy to get out of and smoothly desgined, and the other one is impossible\
      \ to get out of and is arranged in a totally messy manner. With that in mind,when\
      \ designing a base place the laser fences in a reasonable place and make sure\
      \ no base offers an advantage over the other one, even if they are assymetrical.</p>\n\
      <p>A small thing to note is the position of the spawner box. have it in a position\
      \ where it is protected from outside snipers so they cannot in any circumstances\
      \ destroy the spawner without first hacking the fence. Even if it means putting\
      \ a dirty great static mesh in front of it to prevent this, believe me there\
      \ is nothing worse than having your spawner destroyed while your fences are\
      \ intact.</p>\n<p>As for the fences themselves, there is no real guidelines\
      \ to follow other than general scale; you dont</p>\n<p>want a tiny doorway laser\
      \ fence so everyone gets stuck trying to exit (like on rivers of waste 2), but\
      \ at the same time you want to avoid a huge laser fence that makes the defending\
      \ team over-anticipate where the enemy will come through.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ of the coderoom. it should more or less dead in the middle of the map. never\
      \ have just one entrance to the coderoom, this makes it far to easy for the\
      \ team inside to defend. even with two entrances, you should be careful to avoid\
      \ a coderoom that makes it impossible to attack. look at DTT-Union. the coderoom\
      \ has two entrances, but because of its elevated position in is too advantageous\
      \ to the team inside. you can attack and gain control of the coderoom if one\
      \ or two people are in it, but if there is three or more it is simply not possible\
      \ to regain control.</p>\n<p>If you must put the exits/entrances of the coderoom\
      \ right next to each other, provide some cover on at least one so the team that\

    text: "This page is for the Territories [[Legacy:Gametype|gametype]] in the Unreal\
      \ engine game [[Legacy:Devastation|Devastation]].\n\nEven if you dont own Devastation,\
      \ I think this gametype could be a REALLY good mod for other games (hinting\
      \ at someone who knows how to mod games :Rolleyes:)\n\nFor those of you who\
      \ have never heard of Territories, i will give you a quick run-through. There\
      \ are two teams, and each one has its own base.inside each base is a spawning\
      \ machine which brings you back to life when you are killed. The base is protected\
      \ by laser fences which will only open to let your team through. The map has\

      \ at the fence. When the fence is disabled, you have to storm the base and destroy\
      \ the spawner so the enemy team will not be coming back. you have won the game\
      \ when all of the enemy has been killed. Weapons are obtained by a loadout system.\
      \ When you kill an enemy you recieve a amount of points which you exchange for\
      \ weapons and ammunition in a designated loadout volume inside your base. Obvoiusly\
      \ the less effective weapons (micro viper, 9mm SMG, Handguns etc) are less expensive\
      \ while the more effective weapons (Cobra cannon, particle laser rifle, antique\
