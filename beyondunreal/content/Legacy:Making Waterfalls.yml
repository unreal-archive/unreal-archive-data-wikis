      \ when the player isn't able to get really close to that waterfall. Cos if you\
      \ get to close, the fog will not look that great.</li>\n<li>You can use a <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:SmokeGenerator\" title=\"Legacy:SmokeGenerator\">SmokeGenerator</a>.\
      \ Do remember that they'll need to be triggered, before they will emit fog.</li>\n\

      <p>To create one large, localized ripple effect in the water surface:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>Create a square, horizontal <a href=\"/Legacy:Sheet\" title=\"Legacy:Sheet\"\

      <li>add it as a non-solid 1 unit above the water surface</li>\n<li>apply the\

      \ in <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_1\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal 1\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      >Unreal 1</a>'s \"Nyleve\" level (check...? it's the first outdoor level in\

      <p>Don't forget to add ambient sound to your waterfall. This is VERY important,\
      \ because a waterfall without sound is very unrealistic. Also, the ambient sound\
      \ can be quite loud, to give the waterfall more 'power'.</p>\n<p>Note that you\
      \ don't need to add an <a href=\"/Legacy:AmbientSound_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:AmbientSound\
      \ (UT)\">AmbientSound (UT)</a> actor specifically, you can set the Sound properties\
      \ of any actor that's already in the right place – the SmokeGenerator would\
      \ do fine if you're using one.</p>\n<p>Try adding a very loud sound next to\
      \ the waterfall with a small radius so that it sounds very loud when you are\
      \ near it, then add another one which is a lot quieter but with a very large\
      \ radius so that you can hear the waterfall slightly from a long way away.</p>\n\
