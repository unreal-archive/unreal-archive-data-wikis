      <p>Make these types of things in UnrealEd is quite easy, and I'll attempt to\
      \ explain it as quickly and concisely as possible. First of all, I'll assume\
      \ you already know about <a href=\"/Legacy:Zoning\" title=\"Legacy:Zoning\"\
      >Zoning</a>. Now that we've assumed that, go into your actor browser under Info.</p>\n\
      <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Getting_Set_up\">Getting Set up</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Gravity,_Warp_Tunnels?section=2\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Getting Set up\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n\
      <p>Add a <a href=\"/Legacy:ZoneInfo\" title=\"Legacy:ZoneInfo\">ZoneInfo</a>\
      \ (just plain \"ZoneInfo\", nothing fancy\") into your map in the appropriate\
      \ zone (the one that you want to have different gravity or velocity effects).</p>\n\
      <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ZoneGravity\">ZoneGravity</span><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Gravity,_Warp_Tunnels?section=3\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: ZoneGravity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Now go into that new ZoneInfo's properties. Under\
      \ the \"ZoneInfo\" tab inside its properties, you shall find settings called\
      \ \"ZoneGravity\" and \"ZoneVelocity\". Zone gravity is just that - the gravity\
      \ of the area. It starts at -950.00Z, and 0 in the X and Y axis'. What does\
      \ this mean? You're moving downward (hence the minus sign) 950 units at whatever\
      \ rate the editor uses - the standard UT gravity, which I'm sure you're familiar\
      \ with. Turning it to, say, -450 would allow you to jump over twice as high\
      \ and fall half as fast. The X-axis refers to the horizontal plane, and the\
      \ Y-axis refers to the vertical plane, from a bird's eye perspective. Setting\
      \ these to plus or minus would pull you in that direction in that plane. Note\
      \ that with ZoneGravity you will always run at the same speed, etc, unless your\
      \ feet leave the ground - in which case, your gravity settings will influence\
      \ the player's movement. More technically, gravity only affects players when\
      \ they are in Physics state \"Falling\".</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>ZoneVelocity, unlike gravity, automatically shoots\
      \ players in whatever direction you say, but it works the same way. There is\
      \ not much distinction between gravity and Velocity, as far as I can tell, but\
      \ they do interact with each other - look at CTF-HallofGiants, for example.\
      \ You can use these in conjunction for more realistic gravity effects, or you\
      \ can use ZoneVelocity to create warp tunnels (separate your warp tunnel into\
      \ several different zones, and use a ZoneInfo in each zone with the ZoneVelocity\
      \ property set to appropriate levels, and your players will be shot through\
      \ it at whatever direction you've chosen, assuming you set the XYZ velocity\
      \ properly).</p>\n<p>Tip: to make dynamic water, you can use the following settings\
      \ as an example, ZoneInfo -&gt; ZoneLight -&gt; TexVPanSpeed = 7 correspond\
      \ to WaterZoneInfo -&gt; ZoneInfo -&gt; ZoneVelocity -&gt; Y = 100 (for instance,\
      \ a river stream) -Gui</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wrapping_it_Up\"\

      <p>This should give you some basics, but I can't tell you everything - just\
      \ work off of what you've learned and experiment, experiment, experiment. Eventually\
      \ you'll figure it out, but as with all XYZ coordinate systems, you'll still\
      \ be experimenting a lot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Tutorial\" title=\"\

      \ If I got the two above sections correct there is a very big distinction between\
      \ gravity and velocity. Gravity doesn't move you if your feet are on the ground,\
      \ but you get moved in a Velocity-Zone. So e.g. if you'd have a wind-tunnel\
      \ with a big fan at the end and want to make that move players around the tunnel\
      \ you'd have to use velocity. (which let's me think of nice traps - Can you\
      \ trigger Velocity/Gravity on and off?&#160;;)</p>\n<p><b>Jeeptrash:</b> As\
      \ far as gravity vs velocity goes- you can be moved in one direction by gravity\
      \ with your feet on the ground: +Z, aka up. I have a zone that I wanted to use\
      \ gravity in a horizontal direction in, so I set the +X gravity that I wanted\
      \ to have, and then set Z to +8... just enough of a lift to get the feet off\
      \ the ground.</p>\n<p>You may have read elsewhere that jumppads can be flaky\
      \ when used on bots. I've found that all zoneVelocity is flaky with bots, which\
      \ I assume most peoples jumppads use. I use zoneGravity instead and tho its\
      \ not perfect its much more reliable.</p>\n<p><b>Luggage:</b> Someone should\
      \ point out that ZoneGravity gradually accelerates players until they reach\
      \ the specified TerminalVelocity, while ZoneVelocity adds the set velocity to\
      \ the players instantly.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.022\
