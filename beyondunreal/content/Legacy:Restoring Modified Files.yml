      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are several traps when creating new Unreal content.</p>\n\
      <p>For example it's tempting to add new textures to existing texture packages\
      \ when building a map, but look at it from a practical way: How are other players\
      \ supposed to get the new texture if it's inside <i>your</i> version of the\
      \ package but not <i>theirs</i>? Anyway, if you really modified such a data\
      \ package you can't just remove the texture and save again. The package will\
      \ stay modified! You can only restore it from your game CD(s) or DVD in this\
      \ case.</p>\n<p>Another problem in UT200x could be the UPL files, which contain\
      \ information about player models. For example <a href=\"/Legacy:UPaint\" title=\"\
      Legacy:UPaint\">UPaint</a> likes to override existing characters to make sure\
      \ you specify a different name as soon as possible. The game server won't mind\
      \ if you modify them, but cheat protections like UTSecure, Anti TCC and SafeGame\
      \ will detect modifications and call you a cheater! (You don't want that, right?)</p>\n\
      <p>Other potential problems include buggy mod installers, which accidently copy\
      \ mod files over core game files or buggy mod <b>un</b>installers, which remove\
      \ more than they were supposed to (Ok, developers deserve a slap for something\
      \ like that, but that's nothing we want to discuss here.&#160;;)), as well as\
      \ outdated patches such as the UnrealEd patches for UT2003, which should <i>only</i>\
      \ be applied to the unpatched game and are obsoleted by any newer patch.</p>\n\
      <p>And finally, some people seem to be inclined to install stuff like \"No CD\
      \ Cracks\" and the like – don't do that, not only are you probably violating\
      \ the EULA, but you may also break important game files.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Detecting Damage\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Sometimes modified files don't become appearant immediately.</p>\n\
      <p>Often you will notice modified packages when you connect to internet game\
      \ servers. If a package required for the current game has been modified and\
      \ is not dynamically loaded client-sidely, you will be disconnected with the\
      \ message \"Version Mismatch\" and the package name. (If you get \"Incompatible\
      \ Game Files\" instead, then it might be only a poorly coded mod that doesn't\
      \ properly unload itself from memory when switching servers.)</p>\n<p>If the\
      \ server is running a cheat protection, it may also find other modifications\
      \ such as UPL file changes. If you get disconnected from a server and get a\
      \ mesage box, read it carefully. Often it tells you exactly what you need to\
      \ look for.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Finding_The_Modified_File\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Finding The Modified File\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Finding out which file is actually modified can be\
      \ quite easy if you got a message with information about the problem.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Version_Mismatch\">Version Mismatch</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Restoring_Modified_Files?section=4\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Version Mismatch\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>A \"Version Mismatch\" message usually contains a package name. This is the\
      \ file name without file extension, so you will have to look in your package\
      \ directories first.</p>\n<p>If you aren't sure where you have to look for the\
      \ files, just open your game's main INI file (UnrealTournament.ini, UT2003.ini,\
      \ UT2004.ini, etc. in {<a href=\"/Legacy:Base_Directory\" title=\"Legacy:Base\
      \ Directory\">Base Directory</a>}\\System) and look for the <code>[Core.System]</code>\
      \ section. You will find several lines that begin with \"Path=\" followed by\
      \ a string that represents a directory name and a file wildcard.</p>\n<p>For\
      \ example:</p>\n<pre>Paths=*.u\nPaths=../Maps/*.ut2\nPaths=../Textures/*.utx\n\
      </pre>\n<p>This means the game looks for files with the extension .U in {<a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Base_Directory\" title=\"Legacy:Base Directory\">Base Directory</a>}\\\
      System (Paths=*.u), with the extension .UT2 in {<a href=\"/Legacy:Base_Directory\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Base Directory\">Base Directory</a>}\\Maps and with the extension\
      \ .UTX in {<a href=\"/Legacy:Base_Directory\" title=\"Legacy:Base Directory\"\
      >Base Directory</a>}\\Textures. So if you got a \"Version Mismatch\" for \"\
      DM-Modifier\" you'd probably find the file DM-Modifier.ut2 in the Maps directory\
      \ and know that it's not the same version as the server wants.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Restoring_Modified_Files?section=5\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Modified UPL Files\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Some cheat protections may give you a message like \"Modified Character Entry\
      \ Detected\". In this case you either have a modified UPL file or an additional\
      \ UPL file that overrides entries in the original one.</p>\n<p>Usually The game\
      \ looks for them in {<a href=\"/Legacy:Base_Directory\" title=\"Legacy:Base\
      \ Directory\">Base Directory</a>}\\System, but it seems UPL files can be placed\
      \ somewhere else as well. You should look in your whole game directory and check\
      \ every single UPL file you find, if they contain an entry for the supposedly\
      \ modified character. UT2003 contains 147 and UT2004 179 uniquely named character\
      \ entries and no other UPL file should use these.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ in the correct directory and you are done. Here's a possible way for doing\
      \ this:\n<ol>\n<li>Open a console window. Under Windows you would do this by\
      \ selecting Start -&gt; Run... and enter \"command\" under Windows 98/ME in\
      \ the dialog box, while under Windows 2000/XP you'd enter \"cmd\" there.<br\
      \ />\nYou should now get the console window with a prompt that looks something\
      \ like \"<code>C:\\Windows&gt;</code>\" and a cursor blinking after that.</li>\n\
      <li>Change the drive to the one where your game is installed. For this example\
      \ we have UT2004 installed in D:\\UT2004, so type:</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\
      <pre>d:\n</pre>\n<p>The prompt should now change to \"<code>D:\\&gt;</code>\"\
      .</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Change to your game's System directory, in our\
      \ example this is UT2004\\System, so type:</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<pre>cd\
      \ \\UT2004\\System\n</pre>\n<p>The propt should have turned into \"<code>D:\\\
      UT2004\\System&gt;</code>\" now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Now you're ready\
      \ to decompress the file or files you want to restore. For each file you need\
      \ to type \"UCC Decompress filename\" now. For example if you want to restore\
      \ PlayerSkins.utx in the Textures directory you'd type:</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<pre>UCC Decompress ..\\Textures\\PlayerSkins.utx.uz2\n</pre>\n<p>UCC\
      \ will tell you that it decompresses that file to ..\\Textures\\PlayerSkins.utx\
      \ for you. Repeat this step for every .UZ or UZ2 file you copied from the CD\
      \ or DVD.</p>\n<p>That's all. Try connecting to servers to see if the files\
      \ were properly restored and whether you need to restore other files as well.</p>\n\

      \ do that, not only are you probably violating the EULA, but you may also break\
      \ important game files.\n\n==Detecting Damage==\n\nSometimes modified files\
      \ don't become appearant immediately.\n\nOften you will notice modified packages\
      \ when you connect to internet game servers. If a package required for the current\
      \ game has been modified and is not dynamically loaded client-sidely, you will\
      \ be disconnected with the message \"Version Mismatch\" and the package name.\
      \ (If you get \"Incompatible Game Files\" instead, then it might be only a poorly\
      \ coded mod that doesn't properly unload itself from memory when switching servers.)\n\
      \nIf the server is running a cheat protection, it may also find other modifications\
      \ such as UPL file changes. If you get disconnected from a server and get a\
      \ mesage box, read it carefully. Often it tells you exactly what you need to\
      \ look for.\n\n==Finding The Modified File==\n\nFinding out which file is actually\
      \ modified can be quite easy if you got a message with information about the\
      \ problem.\n\n===Version Mismatch===\n\nA \"Version Mismatch\" message usually\
      \ contains a package name. This is the file name without file extension, so\
      \ you will have to look in your package directories first.\n\nIf you aren't\
      \ sure where you have to look for the files, just open your game's main INI\
      \ file (UnrealTournament.ini, UT2003.ini, UT2004.ini, etc. in {[[Legacy:Base\
      \ Directory|Base Directory]]}\\System) and look for the <code>[Core.System]</code>\
      \ section. You will find several lines that begin with \"Path=\" followed by\
      \ a string that represents a directory name and a file wildcard.\n\nFor example:\n\
      \ Paths=*.u\n Paths=../Maps/*.ut2\n Paths=../Textures/*.utx\n\nThis means the\
      \ game looks for files with the extension .U in {[[Legacy:Base Directory|Base\
      \ Directory]]}\\System (Paths=*.u), with the extension .UT2 in {[[Legacy:Base\
      \ Directory|Base Directory]]}\\Maps and with the extension .UTX in {[[Legacy:Base\
      \ Directory|Base Directory]]}\\Textures. So if you got a \"Version Mismatch\"\
      \ for \"DM-Modifier\" you'd probably find the file DM-Modifier.ut2 in the Maps\
      \ directory and know that it's not the same version as the server wants.\n\n\
      ===Modified UPL Files===\n\nSome cheat protections may give you a message like\
      \ \"Modified Character Entry Detected\". In this case you either have a modified\
      \ UPL file or an additional UPL file that overrides entries in the original\
      \ one.\n\nUsually The game looks for them in {[[Legacy:Base Directory|Base Directory]]}\\\
      System, but it seems UPL files can be placed somewhere else as well. You should\
      \ look in your whole game directory and check every single UPL file you find,\
      \ if they contain an entry for the supposedly modified character. UT2003 contains\
      \ 147 and UT2004 179 uniquely named character entries and no other UPL file\
      \ should use these.\n\n==Restoring The Original File==\n\nHere comes the tricky\
      \ part: You need to somehow find the original version of your file.\n\n===First\
      \ Attempt: The Patch===\n\nModified or damaged .U, .EXE or .DLL files can usually\
      \ be repaired by (re)applying the latest patch. For mod files you should simply\
      \ reinstall the mod. This won't help against modified game data packages or\
      \ UPL files, though.\n\n===Second Attempt: Copying From The Source Disk(s)===\n\
      \n====Know The Source Disks====\n; UT2003 : Usually the game comes on three\
      \ CDs. (international version)<br />On CD1 you will find the UPL files, the\
      \ animation packages (*.ukx), the maps (*.ut2) and some textures (*.utx) and\
      \ sounds. (*.uax) CD2 contains the remaining textures, static meshes (*.usx),\
      \ the OGG music and localized sound packages for French. CD3 contains the localized\
      \ sound packages for German, Italian and Spanish as well as a few tools.\n;\
      \ UT2004 : Usually the game comes on six CDs or one DVD, not counting the bonus\
      \ DVD of the Special Edition. On the DVD there are multiple directories that\
      \ correspond to the disks of the CD version.<br />CD1 contains the UPL files,\
      \ animations, maps and a few sounds. CD2 contains the remaining non-localized\
      \ sounds, and some textures. CD3 contains only textures. CD4 contains the remaining\
      \ textures, the static meshes and most of the OGG music. CD5 contains the remaining\
      \ music and most of the localized sound packages. CD6 contains the remaining\
      \ localized sound packages as well as some tools.\n\n====Extracting The Files====\n\
      \nUPL files can be copied as they are, but package files need to be decompressed\
      \ before you can use them.\n# Delete the modified package file.\n# Copy the\
      \ compressed package file to the directory the file belongs in.\n# Decompress\
      \ the file.<br />Package files are UZ- or UZ2-compressed. Just run them through\
      \ the UCC Decompress [[Legacy:Commandlet|commandlet]] once they are in the correct\
      \ directory and you are done. Here's a possible way for doing this:\n## Open\
      \ a console window. Under Windows you would do this by selecting Start -> Run...\
      \ and enter \"command\" under Windows 98/ME in the dialog box, while under Windows\
      \ 2000/XP you'd enter \"cmd\" there.<br />You should now get the console window\
      \ with a prompt that looks something like \"<code>C:\\Windows></code>\" and\
      \ a cursor blinking after that.\n## Change the drive to the one where your game\
      \ is installed. For this example we have UT2004 installed in D:\\UT2004, so\
      \ type:\n\n d:\n\nThe prompt should now change to \"<code>D:\\></code>\".\n\
      ## Change to your game's System directory, in our example this is UT2004\\System,\
      \ so type:\n\n cd \\UT2004\\System\n\nThe propt should have turned into \"<code>D:\\\
      UT2004\\System></code>\" now.\n## Now you're ready to decompress the file or\
      \ files you want to restore. For each file you need to type \"UCC Decompress\
      \ filename\" now. For example if you want to restore PlayerSkins.utx in the\
      \ Textures directory you'd type:\n\n UCC Decompress ..\\Textures\\PlayerSkins.utx.uz2\n\
      \nUCC will tell you that it decompresses that file to ..\\Textures\\PlayerSkins.utx\
      \ for you. Repeat this step for every .UZ or UZ2 file you copied from the CD\
      \ or DVD.\n\nThat's all. Try connecting to servers to see if the files were\
      \ properly restored and whether you need to restore other files as well.\n\n\
