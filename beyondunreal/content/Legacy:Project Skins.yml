    text: "<p>April 2003:</p>\n<p>I've done a revamp of the template system. This\
      \ makes a lot of design things easier, but I've got to convert the old styles\
      \ and templates. stay tuned.</p>\n<p>summary of changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>templates\
      \ instead of headers: a template is a full HMTL file, with the same placeholders\
      \ as templates had, but with also&#160;%content% and&#160;%footer%</li>\n<li>the\
      \ default site look now has a sidebar – people are always saying it's hard to\
      \ navigate the site. Well, all users get the sidebar when they arrive, so they\
      \ can see what's available.\n<ul>\n<li>faster loads: the sidebar is at the end\
      \ of the HTML document, so page loads should be better than the old sidebar\
      \ look.</li>\n<li>better use of screen space: actual page content begins much\
      \ nearer the top of the page.&#160;:)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>editable sidebar\
      \ – the links on <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_Sidebar\" title=\"Legacy:Wiki Sidebar\"\

      <p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> I find that the loading of the sidebar should load first\
      \ for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For fellow 56kers, it is rather\
      \ annoying for waiting for the page to load and then click on the link that\
      \ i wanted to click on the left.</li>\n<li>The sidebar loads faster, and allows\
      \ rapid link opening.</li>\n<li>To get rid of annoyance.</li>\n<li>For over\
      \ all appeal to the wiki.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Could you please take that into consideration?\
      \ (The good news: The edit feature is sooo 1337&#160;:) )</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ No, it loads last <i>for exactly the same reasons you gave</i>. What's most\
      \ important? the <i>page content</i>. so that loads as early as possible. I'm\
      \ on a 56k too.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> It is a pestilence for people\
      \ like me who like fast linkage of information. How big is the sidebar, anyway?\
      \ There should be in the preferences an otion that states if the user wants\
      \ to load the sidebar first or last. The sidebar should load last by default.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> If you specifically want to click on a link from the sidebar\
      \ first, load <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_Sidebar\" title=\"Legacy:Wiki Sidebar\"\
      >Wiki Sidebar</a> to start with. I completely agree with tarquin that it defeats\
      \ most of the purpose of this CSS solution to make the sidebar load first <i>anyway</i>.</p>\n\
      <p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> Is it possible for an option in the Preferences to allow\
      \ the user to pick if the sidebar loads first or last? I find it annoying for\
      \ it to load loat and whenever i press the stop button, i lose the sidebar and\
      \ that is really bad. Any comments?</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> Also, the recent\
      \ chages loads really slow and the sidebar doesnt load until last, and having\
      \ that option stated above makes this site more professional.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ why are you pressing the stop button before the page is fully loaded? If you've\
      \ realised you don't want to read this page, hit the \"back\" button&#160;:)\
      \ I suppose I <i>could</i> make an alternative sidebar page... but this way\
      \ round is the better way – read sites on CSS site design: they all say it's\
      \ more professional to load page content as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>\
      \ Scenario: I load the <a href=\"/Legacy:Recent_Changes\" title=\"Legacy:Recent\
      \ Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Recent Changes</a> Page. I see an edit that\
      \ I want to see. I stop it. No sidebar!&#160;:(</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> ...\
      \ load the page you want to see... and hey presto, that has a sidebar too! If\
      \ you find RC takes a long time to load – change your preferences to show fewer\
      \ days. Mine is set to 3&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> The sidebar is\
      \ having problems now.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Problems\"\

      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> OK. Two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I can fix this for small\
      \ font-sizes, but it involves fixing the width of the sidebar &amp; the left-margin\
      \ of the content to 150px. This means very large font sizes will dribble down\
      \ the sidebar in a column, instead of fluid growth.</li>\n<li>the culprit is\
      \ the overflow:hidden property. I can hide this from opera, but you might get\
      \ scroll bars.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your choice, Mych (and other Opera users). Does\
      \ Op7 have this prob too?</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b> Haven't/can't re-create this\

      \ hmm. Opera 7 problem with overflow:hidden? Take a look in Mozilla: there is\
      \ some clever CSS trickery that centers the logo no matter what, and allows\
      \ part of the image to go past the <i>left</i> of the sidebar.</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd><b>Mychaeel:</b> Actually, the overlapping starts when the first page\
      \ of content has been scrolled down (when the sidebar magically reappears as\
      \ well). Before, the logo is clipped – which doesn't look too great either.\
      \ The sidebar takes its width from <i>somewhere</i>, anyway – maybe making the\
      \ logo a simple centered image would automatically widen the sidebar to accommodate\
      \ its width.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Tarquin:</b> position:absolute and fixed\
      \ won't grow for an element that's too large. the sidebar width is set in ems\
      \ so it grows &amp; shrinks with the user's font settings. the clipping is ok\
      \ here: at normal font size I just lose 3-4 pixels off each side of the logo.\
      \ Hmmm.... I see the problem in Opera. It's a bug on their part – it's forgetting\
      \ overflow:hidden. not sure what can be done – other than scrap the whole design</dd>\n\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The script will be updated this week to create DIV\
      \ blocks around the wiki page content. This means that header stylesheets will\
      \ set body margins &amp; padding to zero, and div.wiki can set the padding property\
      \ to create margins around the content.</p>\n<p>I haven't hacked the script\
      \ that much, so admin pages (note to non-admins: you're really not missing much)\
      \ are plain white background. If you're styling pale A tags, specialize them\
      \ as \"div.wiki a\". (messy, I know... I need to go through the perl and put\
      \ div.wiki around all pages...)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use div.wiki to set content margins\
      \ (with the padding property), background colour, and font settings.</li>\n\
      <li>Other divs:\n<ul>\n<li>footer: for the links and search box at the base\
      \ of each page.</li>\n<li>edit: for the edit page</li>\n<li>rc: recent changes</li>\n\
      </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Class blocks are on their way too. Style the following named\
      \ div classes:\n<ul>\n<li>Code&#160;: for code listings (use whitespace property\
      \ to preserve formatting, set font, border etc)</li>\n<li>Quote: blockquote</li>\n\
      <li>Zip: a link to a zipfile</li>\n<li>Array: browsers don't yet support the\
      \ CSS, but style this similarly to Code block</li>\n<li>class: the box that\
      \ holds the class tree definition</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Images are now getting\
      \ a class instead of the HTML align property. Most images will be img.block.\
      \ Style this to display:block so it doesn't interfere with text around it.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Formatting .zip file links somehow special\
      \ is a very neat idea, but the current formatting doesn't work too well with\
      \ its technical implementation as a <span>element (see <a href=\"/Legacy:Model_Conversion_Application\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Model Conversion Application\">Model Conversion Application</a>).\
      \ What about the following: Reduce the icon's size to 16x16 pixels and remove\
      \ the border and background?</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Tarquin:</b> That CSS was\
      \ written with the idea that a zipfile link would be a block element, rather\
      \ than a link within text. I'll fix it for inline, but I do think some zip links\
      \ could do to stand out from the body of a page in their own box.</span></p>\n\
      <p><span><b>Mychaeel:</b> I've changed that and uploaded a smaller .zip file\
      \ icon.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Tarquin:</b> The smaller icon is nice, but I'd\
      \ like to have a zip block that uses the larger icon – maybe just for local\
      \ zipfiles like example maps.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Mychaeel:</b> Why not\
      \ – it could be made a paragraph markup in WookeeUnreal.pm: Paragraphs starting\
      \ with <code><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://\\S+\\\
      .zip\\b\">http://\\S+\\.zip\\b</a></code> could be formatted as such a link\
      \ (and maybe such starting with <code>[^\\s:/]+\\.zip\\b</code>, which would\
      \ be interpreted as a file in our download directory).</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ would it be simpler to subclass blockquote, and have paragraphs of the form\
      \ <code>&gt; something.zip</code> &#160;?</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Not really; especially since <code>&gt;</code> is really a block in disguise\
      \ of paragraph markup. But even if it were paragraph markup, creating a direct\
      \ subclass of <code>Paragraph</code> would be the easiest and most straightforward\
      \ way to go.</span></p>\n<p><span>Implement <code>markupParse</code> by means\
      \ of a regular expression that looks for and parses that <code><a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external free\" href=\"http://\">http://</a>...</code> at the start\
      \ of a line, let <code>Paragraph</code>'s inherited code handle character markup\
      \ in what follows, and overwrite <code>result</code> or maybe better just <code>propParaStart</code>/<code>propParaEnd</code>\
      \ to have your subclass output the HTML for the link. – I'll meet you in #unrealwiki\
      \ to explain it in more detail if you like.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Better look at <code>ParagraphUnrealImage</code> in WookeeUnreal.pm – it works\
      \ very similar to how I figure that .zip link paragraph class to work (except\
      \ that <code>ParagraphUnrealImage</code> splits into three slightly different\
      \ subclasses for the three possible image alignments – you don't have to do\
      \ that).</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span><b>Mychaeel:</b> I also changed the general\
      \ font size of the Chilled Blue Plain skin to 9pt. Maybe it's just me, but I\
      \ think it looks more pleasing to the eye than 10pt. &#160;:-)</span></p>\n\
      <p><span><b>Tarquin:</b> 9pt looks good. I'll change the zip class on the other\
      \ stylesheets too.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Mychaeel:</b> What about reviving\
      \ the idea of allowing people to specify a custom stylesheet location in their\
      \ preferences?</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Tarquin:</b> I'll investigate at some\
      \ point. But they could just as easily email me their CSS and have it available\
      \ to all.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Mychaeel:</b> The benefit of a custom CSS\
      \ file stored somewhere under the user's immediate control is that he/she's\
      \ able to test and tweak the styles without much hassle. <i>After that,</i>\
      \ he/she'd might send you the file to put it on the Wiki. Besides, not everybody\
      \ wants his/her custom styles to be publicly available.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ Yup, I realised that shortly after posting my earlier comment. Like TV studios,\
      \ my brain is on a delay loop... sigh...</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p><span><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Isn't Chilled Blue the default skin? I thought it was (and I'd prefer it that\
      \ way), but I'm typing from an installation of Internet Explorer here that has\
      \ never before been touched by the Bliss That Is Wiki, and hence I'm not logged\
      \ in. The skin has a white background. – WillySurvive mentioned that it also\
      \ still has the gray background and the border around .zip file links; that\
      \ should go, in any case, because they mess up the layout.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ yes, is was &amp; it should be. I think I've found the bug &amp; fixed it,\
      \ but I can't check. Could you confirm?</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Ben 2500:</b>\

  wikitext:
    text: "April 2003:\n\nI've done a revamp of the template system. This makes a\
      \ lot of design things easier, but I've got to convert the old styles and templates.\
      \ stay tuned.\n\nsummary of changes:\n\n* templates instead of headers: a template\
      \ is a full HMTL file, with the same placeholders as templates had, but with\
      \ also %content% and %footer%\n* the default site look now has a sidebar &ndash;\
      \ people are always saying it's hard to navigate the site. Well, all users get\
      \ the sidebar when they arrive, so they can see what's available. \n** faster\
      \ loads: the sidebar is at the end of the HTML document, so page loads should\
      \ be better than the old sidebar look.\n** better use of screen space: actual\
      \ page content begins much nearer the top of the page. :)\n* editable sidebar\
      \ &ndash; the links on [[Legacy:Wiki Sidebar|Wiki sidebar]] produce the actual\
      \ sidebar. go see that page & suggest links!\n* the old text styles will be\
      \ imported later\n\n''you can rant about it all here''\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Very\
      \ nice.  :-)\n\n====Sidebar question ====\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' I find that\
      \ the loading of the sidebar should load first for the following reasons:\n\
      # For fellow 56kers, it is rather annoying for waiting for the page to load\
      \ and then click on the link that i wanted to click on the left.\n# The sidebar\
      \ loads faster, and allows rapid link opening.\n# To get rid of annoyance.\n\
      # For over all appeal to the wiki.\n\nCould you please take that into consideration?\
      \ (The good news: The edit feature is sooo 1337 :) )\n\n'''Tarquin:''' No, it\
      \ loads last ''for exactly the same reasons you gave''. What's most important?\
      \ the ''page content''. so that loads as early as possible. I'm on a 56k too.\
      \ :)\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' It is a pestilence for people like me who like fast\
      \ linkage of information. How big is the sidebar, anyway? There should be in\
      \ the preferences an otion that states if the user wants to load the sidebar\
      \ first or last. The sidebar should load last by default.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ If you specifically want to click on a link from the sidebar first, load [[Legacy:Wiki\
      \ Sidebar|Wiki Sidebar]] to start with.  I completely agree with tarquin that\
      \ it defeats most of the purpose of this CSS solution to make the sidebar load\
      \ first ''anyway''.\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Is it possible for an option in the\
      \ Preferences to allow the user to pick if the sidebar loads first or last?\
      \ I find it annoying for it to load loat and whenever i press the stop button,\
      \ i lose the sidebar and that is really bad. Any comments?\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:'''\
      \ Also, the recent chages loads really slow and the sidebar doesnt load until\
      \ last, and having that option stated above makes this site more professional.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' why are you pressing the stop button before the page is fully\
      \ loaded? If you've realised you don't want to read this page, hit the \"back\"\
      \ button :) I suppose I ''could'' make an alternative sidebar page... but this\
      \ way round is the better way &ndash; read sites on CSS site design: they all\
      \ say it's more professional to load page content as soon as possible. \n\n\
      '''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Scenario: I load the [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent Changes]]\
      \ Page. I see an edit that I want to see. I stop it. No sidebar! :(\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ ... load the page you want to see... and hey presto, that has a sidebar too!\
      \ If you find RC takes a long time to load &ndash; change your preferences to\
      \ show fewer days. Mine is set to 3 :)\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' The sidebar is\
      \ having problems now.\n\n==Problems ==\n\n===Opera 6 windowshade effect===\n\
      \n...although it displays some oddities when scrolling with Opera 6; the light-blue\
      \ background of the sidebar scrolls along (the text stays though), progressively\
      \ hiding the sidebar, until it would be completely scrolled away &ndash; then\
      \ it reappears\n\n: '''Tarquin:''' Known bug. :( I've emailed the css-discuss\
      \ list to see if anyone knows what the problem is. \n\n'''Tarquin:''' found\
      \ the problem. It is now ''partially'' fixed &ndash; no more windowshade as\
      \ long as the logo is not bigger than the sidebar\n\n'''Tarquin:''' OK. Two\
      \ options:\n\n# I can fix this for small font-sizes, but it involves fixing\
      \ the width of the sidebar & the left-margin of the content to 150px. This means\
      \ very large font sizes will dribble down the sidebar in a column, instead of\
      \ fluid growth. \n# the culprit is the overflow:hidden property. I can hide\
      \ this from opera, but you might get scroll bars.\n\nYour choice, Mych (and\
      \ other Opera users). Does Op7 have this prob too?\n\n'''DJPaul:''' Haven't/can't\
      \ re-create this in Opera 7.03.\n\n===consistency of fonts===\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ The links at the top, in the sidebar and at the bottom are in Times instead\
      \ of Arial.  Is that on purpose?  I think at least the top and bottom links\
      \ should be Arial too if the rest is.\n\n: '''Tarquin:''' those are part of\
      \ the template rather than the content style. But I have a technique to fix\
      \ that. Fixed :D The trick is expalined below.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' The sidebar\
      \ still uses Times?\n\n===RC & Edit page backgrounds===\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' The\
      \ [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent Changes]] background and the edit page background\
      \ are darker-blue (like the sidebar) instead of light-blue like the normal pages.\
      \  I think both should be light-blue.\n\n: '''Tarquin:''' it's an oversight\
      \ on my part. Fixed :cool: (though I kinda liked the double border effect in\
      \ the edit page!!)\n\n===Top search field in the sidebar template===\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ The search field on top doesn't work because the link is broken (\"cgi-wiki\"\
      \ instead of \"cgi-bin\").\n: '''Tarquin:'''  fixed. [[Legacy:Delete Reply When\
      \ You See It|Delete reply when you see it]]\n\n===Sidebar width===\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ The sidebar should have its minimum width set to the logo's width; my custom\
      \ local CSS puts the text in Arial 9pt too, and then the logo overlaps the page\
      \ content. \n\n: '''Tarquin:'''  hmm. Opera 7 problem with overflow:hidden?\
      \ Take a look in Mozilla: there is some clever CSS trickery that centers the\
      \ logo no matter what, and allows part of the image to go past the ''left''\
      \ of the sidebar.\n\n:'''Mychaeel:''' Actually, the overlapping starts when\
      \ the first page of content has been scrolled down (when the sidebar magically\
      \ reappears as well).  Before, the logo is clipped &ndash; which doesn't look\
      \ too great either.  The sidebar takes its width from ''somewhere'', anyway\
      \ &ndash; maybe making the logo a simple centered image would automatically\
      \ widen the sidebar to accommodate its width.\n\n:'''Tarquin:''' position:absolute\
      \ and fixed won't grow for an element that's too large. the sidebar width is\
      \ set in ems so it grows & shrinks with the user's font settings. the clipping\
      \ is ok here: at normal font size I just lose 3-4 pixels off each side of the\
      \ logo. Hmmm.... I see the problem in Opera. It's a bug on their part &ndash;\
      \ it's forgetting overflow:hidden. not sure what can be done &ndash; other than\
      \ scrap the whole design\n\nThe top bar should have a minimum height for similar\
      \ reasons.\n\n: '''Tarquin:'''How do I set a minimum dimension, yet also allow\
      \ it to grow? The top bar height is set in ems, but I don't know how to set\
      \ a minimum too.\n\n:'''Mychaeel:''' Using the CSS2 \"min-height\" attribute.\n\
      \n===Quick Navigation===\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' The purpose of \"Quick Navigation\"\
      \ menu is even less obvious than before (then, it at least stood out because\
      \ it was the only thing in the menu line at the right side); I suggest it gets\
      \ a small downward triangle to indicate that it's a menu and moves back to the\
      \ page's title line.\n\n: '''Tarquin:'''will look into it.\n\n===CSS changes\
      \ break image uploader layout===\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' The changed CSS breaks the\
      \ image uploader layout.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Fixed, sort of.\n\n==neat tricks==\n\
      \nTo set template elements from the content sheet, use this:\n\n body.default\
      \ h1.pagetitle {\n\neach template gives body a different class  &ndash; so you\
      \ can set a content rule to only apply to a specific body\n\n==Other stuff==\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' Mych, is the DHTML menu style stuff the same all the time?\
      \ the \"<style type=\"text/css\">#dhtml-menu ...\" that's inserted into wiki\
      \ pages. If so, how about I put it into the structural stylesheet (which I forgot\
      \ to attach ... off to fix ;)\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' There was a distinct reason\
      \ I had the script include rather than link those CSS styles.  I think one of\
      \ the browsers I tested it with had problems applying the CSS to the menu if\
      \ it had to be loaded separately.\n\n----\n\n==Old System==\n\nYou can choose\
      \ a header and a stylesheet for the site on the Preferences page. At the moment\
      \ we have:\n\n====Headers ====\n* Chilled Blue Plain: Original Unreal Wiki Header,\
      \ default site setting\n* Chilled Blue Sidebar: groovy floating sidebar with\
      \ site links. Mozilla & Opera only.\n* Chilled Blue Sidebar IE: inferior version,\
      \ it scrolls with the page content (and what's the use of a sidebar that scrolls?\
      \ If you don't lack this frightful lack of concern for the IE user, either complain\
      \ to Microsoft about their shoddy implementation on W3C standards, or get a\
      \ decent browser...) \n* Chilled Blue Fixed Header: this header stays visible\
      \ at the top of the browser window when the page is scrolled. Again, IE manages\
      \ to muck this up. \n* Dark Blue Centred: matches with the dark blue content\
      \ styles. Has a groovy CSS effect on the links...\n\nSee [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Custom\
      \ Headers]] for technical stuff.\n\n====Styles ====\n* Chilled Blue: the original\
      \ Unreal Wiki stylesheet. Well it had to be called <i>something</i>\n* Textbook:\
      \ serif fonts on white background with clean pastel blocks for structure.\n\
      * Dark: for the people who said the above was too pale\n* Dark with blocks:\
      \ chunky headers on a navy background. Not sure I like this one.\n* Blocks:\
      \ makes block headers so they stand out more\n* AquaGenic: designed by [[Legacy:The\
      \ Alien|The Alien]]. ''I'll leave it to him to describe it here...''\n* The\
      \ TaoFuzzPai: makes headings centred and IN CAPS, especially for two of our\
      \ veteran BuF controbutors.\n\n==Making a custom stylesheet ==\n\n(some brief\
      \ notes I'll expand on later)\n\n'''What follows below is somewhat outdated.\
      \ if you have a burning itch to create a stylesheet for UnrealWiki, hassle [[Legacy:Tarquin|tarquin]]\
      \ into updating this page.'''\n\nSave the [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Styles\
      \ Testbed]] as an HTML file. Edit it and replace the link to the stylesheet\
      \ named \"styles.something.css\" with your own file. Email completed CSS documents\
      \ to Tarquin for inclusion on the system.\n\n===Testbed pages ===\n\nThese should\
      \ feature all the elements that need to be styled.\n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Styles\
      \ Testbed]] &ndash; now updated! (17 June)\n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Wookee\
      \ Testbed]] &ndash; for the new Wookee markup parser\n\nDo '''not''' style:\n\
      * Body margins\n* H1\n* P because the Wiki script currently doesn't make clean\
      \ P blocks.\n\n===Update ===\n\nThe script will be updated this week to create\
      \ DIV blocks around the wiki page content. This means that header stylesheets\
      \ will set body margins & padding to zero, and div.wiki can set the padding\
      \ property to create margins around the content.\n\nI haven't hacked the script\
      \ that much, so admin pages (note to non-admins: you're really not missing much)\
      \ are plain white background. If you're styling pale A tags, specialize them\
      \ as \"div.wiki a\". (messy, I know... I need to go through the perl and put\
      \ div.wiki around all pages...)\n\n* Use div.wiki to set content margins (with\
      \ the padding property), background colour, and font settings.\n* Other divs:\n\
      ** footer: for the links and search box at the base of each page.\n** edit:\
      \ for the edit page\n** rc: recent changes\n* Class blocks are on their way\
      \ too. Style the following named div classes:\n** Code : for code listings (use\
      \ whitespace property to preserve formatting, set font, border etc)\n** Quote:\
      \ blockquote\n** Zip: a link to a zipfile\n** Array: browsers don't yet support\
      \ the CSS, but style this similarly to Code block\n** class: the box that holds\
      \ the class tree definition\n* Images are now getting a class instead of the\
      \ HTML align property. Most images will be img.block. Style this to display:block\
      \ so it doesn't interfere with text around it.\n\n----\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Formatting\
      \ .zip file links somehow special is a very neat idea, but the current formatting\
      \ doesn't work too well with its technical implementation as a <code><span></code>\
      \ element (see [[Legacy:Model Conversion Application|Model Conversion Application]]).\
      \  What about the following:  Reduce the icon's size to 16x16 pixels and remove\
      \ the border and background?\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  That CSS was written with the\
      \ idea that a zipfile link would be a block element, rather than a link within\
      \ text. I'll fix it for inline, but I do think some zip links could do to stand\
      \ out from the body of a page in their own box. \n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  I've changed\
      \ that and uploaded a smaller .zip file icon.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  The smaller\
      \ icon is nice, but  I'd like to have a zip block that uses the larger icon\
      \ &ndash; maybe just for local zipfiles like example maps.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \  Why not &ndash; it could be made a paragraph markup in WookeeUnreal.pm: \
      \ Paragraphs starting with <code>http://\\S+\\.zip\\b</code> could be formatted\
      \ as such a link (and maybe such starting with <code>[^\\s:/]+\\.zip\\b</code>,\
      \ which would be interpreted as a file in our download directory).\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \  would it be simpler to subclass blockquote, and have paragraphs of the form\
      \ <code> > something.zip </code> ?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Not really; especially\
      \ since <code>></code> is really a block in disguise of paragraph markup.  But\
      \ even if it were paragraph markup, creating a direct subclass of <code>Paragraph</code>\
      \ would be the easiest and most straightforward way to go.\n\nImplement <code>markupParse</code>\
      \ by means of a regular expression that looks for and parses that <code>http://...</code>\
      \ at the start of a line, let <code>Paragraph</code>'s inherited code handle\
      \ character markup in what follows, and overwrite <code>result</code> or maybe\
      \ better just <code>propParaStart</code>/<code>propParaEnd</code> to have your\
      \ subclass output the HTML for the link. &ndash; I'll meet you in #unrealwiki\
      \ to explain it in more detail if you like.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Better look\
      \ at <code>ParagraphUnrealImage</code> in WookeeUnreal.pm &ndash; it works very\
      \ similar to how I figure that .zip link paragraph class to work (except that\
      \ <code>ParagraphUnrealImage</code> splits into three slightly different subclasses\
      \ for the three possible image alignments &ndash; you don't have to do that).\n\
      \n----\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  I also changed the general font size of the Chilled\
      \ Blue Plain skin to 9pt.  Maybe it's just me, but I think it looks more pleasing\
      \ to the eye than 10pt.  :-)\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  9pt looks good. I'll change\
      \ the zip class on the other stylesheets too. \n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  What about\
      \ reviving the idea of allowing people to specify a custom stylesheet location\
      \ in their preferences?\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  I'll investigate at some point. But\
      \ they could just as easily email me their CSS and have it available to all.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:'''  The benefit of a custom CSS file stored somewhere under the\
      \ user's immediate control is that he/she's able to test and tweak the styles\
      \ without much hassle.  ''After that,'' he/she'd might send you the file to\
      \ put it on the Wiki.  Besides, not everybody wants his/her custom styles to\
      \ be publicly available.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Yup, I realised that shortly after\
      \ posting my earlier comment. Like TV studios, my brain is on a delay loop...\
      \ sigh... \n\n----\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Isn't Chilled Blue the default skin? \
      \ I thought it was (and I'd prefer it that way), but I'm typing from an installation\
      \ of Internet Explorer here that has never before been touched by the Bliss\
      \ That Is Wiki, and hence I'm not logged in.  The skin has a white background.\
      \ &ndash; WillySurvive mentioned that it also still has the gray background\
      \ and the border around .zip file links; that should go, in any case, because\
      \ they mess up the layout.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  yes, is was & it should be. I\
      \ think I've found the bug & fixed it, but I can't check. Could you confirm?\n\
      \n'''Ben 2500:''' I like the side bar its a neat addition.\n\n----\n\n'''Sir_Brizz:'''\
      \ In this IE6 I'm using atm, the sidebar is loading on the left side down belwo\
      \ the entire page text.\n\n'''Ben 2500:''' I have this problem to with my computer\
      \ at home with the offline wiki.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Known problem. Fix: get a\
      \ better browser :)\n\n===Stylesheet order===\n\n'''Fyfe:''' Can the order the\
      \ stylesheets are loaded be changed so that <tt>/wiki-ext/stylebase.structural.css</tt>\
      \ is loaded before the theme stylesheet is loaded. At the moment I can't change\
      \ the font-size of the <tt>pre.uscript</tt> blocks because it's overrided by\
      \ <tt>stylebase.structural.css</tt>\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Done. It seems so obvious\
      \ that that is the correct way to do it that I feel there MUST be a reason it\
      \ was the wrong way. Please be on the lookout for anything that's broken because\
      \ of this change, and report them here.\n\n'''Fyfe:''' You sure you fixed it?\
      \ I'm still getting (with browser cache cleared)\n\n<pre>\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\"\
      \ type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\"\n\t\thref=\"/wiki-ext/template-classic-masthead.css\"\
      >\n\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\"\n\t\thref=\"\
      http://www.neptune-one.net/ext/unrealwiki.css\">\n\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\"\
      \ type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\"\n\t\thref=\"/wiki-ext/stylebase.structural.css\"\
      ></pre>\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Ooops. I only changed it on the default template...\n\
      \n'''Fyfe:''' It's working on \"Universal Blue Sidebar\", but \"Classic Blue\
      \ Masterhead\" is still in the wrong order (as above).\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Fixed.\n\
      \n'''Fyfe:''' Thanks Tarquin\n\n'''Tarquin:''' np."
