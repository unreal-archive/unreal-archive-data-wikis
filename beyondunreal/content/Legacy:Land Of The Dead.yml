      <hr />\n<ul>\n<li>If being played on Windows Vista (or 7?), save files are <i>not</i>\
      \ stored in the default \\Land of the Dead\\Saves folder. Windows Vista introduced\
      \ a safety feature that disallows programs run by a standard user (rather than\
      \ run as administrator) write access to the Program Files folder. That being\
      \ said, any modifications or new files will be stored in a remote folder for\
      \ <b>your</b> windows user account. Said folder can be found at <b>C:\\Users\\\
      <i>[Username]</i>\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Program Files</b>. Past that,\
      \ it will mirror your Program Files folder with any directories that contain\
      \ modified files. So navigating into <b>.\\Groove Games\\Land Of The Dead\\\
      System</b>, you will most likely see a few *.ini files that were created due\
      \ to you changing settings. Navigating a directory up, then into the Saves folder,\
      \ you will see all of your save directories, with the information stored within.</li>\n\

      <ul>\n<li>A patch to V1.1 was released in November, 2005, and includes a fair\
      \ amount of updates, as well as support for custom content, and Brain Box's\
      \ version of UnrealEd. The Editor seems mostly unchanged, except it reads *.dz\
      \ files for maps, instead of *.uz files.</li>\n<li>The IPDRV.HttpDownload module\
      \ is utterly broken, on the client end. HTTPDownload is apparently not available\
      \ for this game, unless someone can come up with a unique way of fixing it.</li>\n\
      <li>When a player stands on a static mesh, that is higher than a few UU above\
      \ the zombies, and is lower than another level of accessible geometry, the AI\
      \ gets extremely confused, and causes a fair amount of lag. This is normally\
      \ not an issue with developer shipped levels, which rarely have more than 4\
      \ or 5 enemies at a time, but is an issue for a lot of custom created content.\
      \ Some of the modifications for the game have attempted to alleviate this by\
      \ changing the AI, and some have lessened it, but none have been exceptionally\
      \ successful at eliminating the lag.</li>\n<li>Mover classes, and all their\
      \ subs, suffer from the fact that the KeyRot and KeyPos variables are not replicated,\
      \ which will create all sorts of weird issues online. A few people at <a rel=\"\
      nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.undeadgames.com/\">http://www.undeadgames.com/</a>\
      \ have offered fixes in their forum.</li>\n<li>DestructableMover classes suffer\
      \ from an issue where they are not removed from the world after they suffer\
      \ enough damage to destruct them. This causes splash damage, such as something\
      \ doing damage using the RadiusActors <a href=\"/Legacy:Iterator\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Iterator\">iterator</a> to call TakeDamage() in all nearby actors, to\
      \ cause the mover to replay it's destruction animation, even though it has already\
      \ been destructed. There are two easy ways to fix this in a subclass: From TakeDamage()\
      \ either call Destroy() when the mover has taken fatal damage, or have TakeDamage()\
      \ not call the super if the DamageCapacity &lt;= 0.</li>\n<li>Sometimes on a\
      \ multiplayer game, the zombies will go to negative health, and their bodies\
      \ will explode when you hit them again. This is apparently due to a rumored\
      \ engine bug that causes function calls to mysteriously stop executing when\
      \ they call something that inherits but doesn't define a particular function.\
      \ In this case, it's \"PreventDamage()\" in the gametypes. So, I recommend if\
      \ you do any gametyping, you add a PreventDamage() function, and just point\
      \ it to the super. It may just help.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      <p>The following interfaces are defined in LotD:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>HudDrawable&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>HudDrawable gives any program that implements a drawToHud(Canvas, float,\
      \ float) function, the ability to register with a player's HUD (player.myHUD.register(self)\
      \ according to the comments)and get called for drawing.</dd>\n<dt>SaveHandler&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>SaveHandler is only in a few objects, and gives them the ability to have\
      \ a PreSave() and PostSave() function for when it's time to save.</dd>\n<dt>VideoNotification&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>VideoNotification is apparently used in PlayerController to handle when\

      <dt>MessageDispatcher&#160;</dt>\n<dd>EventDispatcher and MessageDispatcher\
      \ are supposedly implemented in the ObjectiveManager code, but there don't seem\
      \ to be matching interface classes</dd>\n<dt>Smashable&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Smashable\

      \ Java Interface classes.\n\nNew native functions:\n\n; Actor CopyMaterialsToSkins\
      \ : Copies all default materials for a Static or Skeletal Mesh to the Skins[]\
      \ override array of the Actor\n; Actor FilterStateDirty : Unknown\n; PlayerController\
      \ LeaveVoiceChat : Unknown - possibly XBox voice related\n; PlayerController\
      \ ChanveVoiceChatter(int IPAddr, int Handle, bool Add) : Unknown - possibly\
      \ XBox voice related\n; BinkVideoPlayer Bink_Play(string filename) : Play specified\
      \ video\n; BinkVideoPlayer Bink_Scale(float scale) : Scale video (1.0 = normal)\n\
      ; BinkVideoPlayer Bink_Stop : Stop all bink player instances\n; BinkVideoPlayer\
      \ Bink_Is_Playing : returns true if bink is playing, false if not\n; Profiler\
      \ Load(int v) : Load profile? from slot? v\n; Profiler Save : Save profile\n\
      ; Profiler SetValue(string vk, string vv) : Set key/value pair for profile\n\
      ; Profiler GetValue(string v) : Return string value given key 'v'\n; Profiler\
      \ NewProfile(string v) : Create new profile with name 'v'\n; Profiler DeleteProfile(int\
      \ v) : Delete profile from slot? 'v'\n; Profiler GetProfileCount : Loads all\
      \ profiles, refreshes list, returns count of total profiles\n; Profiler GetProfileByName(string\
      \ v) : Returns profile slot? named by 'v'\n; Profiler GetProfileName(int v)\
      \ : Returns string containing profile name, given slot 'v' (note: call GetProfileCount\
      \ first)\n; Profiler GetCurrentProfileName : returns currently loaded profile,\
      \ or \"\" if not loaded\n; Profiler IsValidProfile : Not documented? Not sure\
      \ if this is called in Uscript to return wether we have a valid profile, or\
      \ what\n; Profiler GetTotalCheckpoints : \"Returns total number of checkpoints\
      \ in profile\", whatever that means.\n; Profiler GetChecpoint(int v) : \"Returns\
      \ name of checkpoint at index v\", whatever that means\n\n[[Legacy:Land Of The\
      \ Dead/Actor|Land of the Dead/Actor]] reference\n\n[[Legacy:Land Of The Dead/NavigationPoint|Land\
      \ of the Dead/NavigationPoint]] reference\n\n----\n\n* If being played on Windows\
      \ Vista (or 7?), save files are ''not'' stored in the default \\Land of the\
      \ Dead\\Saves folder. Windows Vista introduced a safety feature that disallows\
      \ programs run by a standard user (rather than run as administrator) write access\
      \ to the Program Files folder. That being said, any modifications or new files\
      \ will be stored in a remote folder for '''your''' windows user account. Said\
      \ folder can be found at '''C:\\Users\\''[Username]''\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\\
      Program Files'''. Past that, it will mirror your Program Files folder with any\
      \ directories that contain modified files. So navigating into '''.\\Groove Games\\\
      Land Of The Dead\\System''', you will most likely see a few *.ini files that\
      \ were created due to you changing settings. Navigating a directory up, then\
      \ into the Saves folder, you will see all of your save directories, with the\
      \ information stored within.\n\n==Known Issues==\n\n* A patch to V1.1 was released\
      \ in November, 2005, and includes a fair amount of updates, as well as support\
      \ for custom content, and Brain Box's version of UnrealEd.  The Editor seems\
      \ mostly unchanged, except it reads *.dz files for maps, instead of *.uz files.\n\
      * The IPDRV.HttpDownload module is utterly broken, on the client end.  HTTPDownload\
      \ is apparently not available for this game, unless someone can come up with\
      \ a unique way of fixing it.\n* When a player stands on a static mesh, that\
      \ is higher than a few UU above the zombies, and is lower than another level\
      \ of accessible geometry, the AI gets extremely confused, and causes a fair\
      \ amount of lag.  This is normally not an issue with developer shipped levels,\
      \ which rarely have more than 4 or 5 enemies at a time, but is an issue for\
      \ a lot of custom created content.  Some of the modifications for the game have\
      \ attempted to alleviate this by changing the AI, and some have lessened it,\
      \ but none have been exceptionally successful at eliminating the lag.\n* Mover\
      \ classes, and all their subs, suffer from the fact that the KeyRot and KeyPos\
      \ variables are not replicated, which will create all sorts of weird issues\
      \ online.  A few people at http://www.undeadgames.com/ have offered fixes in\
      \ their forum.\n* DestructableMover classes suffer from an issue where they\
      \ are not removed from the world after they suffer enough damage to destruct\
      \ them.  This causes splash damage, such as something doing damage using the\
      \ RadiusActors [[Legacy:Iterator|iterator]] to call TakeDamage() in all nearby\
      \ actors, to cause the mover to replay it's destruction animation, even though\
      \ it has already been destructed.  There are two easy ways to fix this in a\
      \ subclass: From TakeDamage() either call Destroy() when the mover has taken\
      \ fatal damage, or have TakeDamage() not call the super if the DamageCapacity\
      \ <= 0.\n* Sometimes on a multiplayer game, the zombies will go to negative\
      \ health, and their bodies will explode when you hit them again.  This is apparently\
      \ due to a rumored engine bug that causes function calls to mysteriously stop\
      \ executing when they call something that inherits but doesn't define a particular\
      \ function.  In this case, it's \"PreventDamage()\" in the gametypes.  So, I\
      \ recommend if you do any gametyping, you add a PreventDamage() function, and\
      \ just point it to the super.  It may just help.\n\n==Interfaces in LotD==\n\
      \nAs mentioned above, LotD seems to have support for Interface classes.  These\
      \ appear to act somewhat like their similarly named Java counterparts, and are\
      \ especially useful for implementing several different behaviours, such as an\
      \ add-on class that is Smashable, Burnable, and Movable.\n\nThe following interfaces\
      \ are defined in LotD:\n\n; HudDrawable : HudDrawable gives any program that\
      \ implements a drawToHud(Canvas, float, float) function, the ability to register\
      \ with a player's HUD (player.myHUD.register(self) according to the comments)and\
      \ get called for drawing.\n; SaveHandler : SaveHandler is only in a few objects,\
      \ and gives them the ability to have a PreSave() and PostSave() function for\
      \ when it's time to save.\n; VideoNotification : VideoNotification is apparently\
      \ used in PlayerController to handle when to pause the game when video begins\
      \ and unpause when video ends\n; EventDispatcher\n; MessageDispatcher : EventDispatcher\
      \ and MessageDispatcher are supposedly implemented in the ObjectiveManager code,\
      \ but there don't seem to be matching interface classes\n; Smashable : Smashable\
      \ is implemented by DOTZDestructableMesh, DOTZDoor, and all subs of WoodenDoor.\n\
