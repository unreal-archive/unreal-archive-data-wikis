      \ of the earliest video games in the 1970's. The field is evolving rapidly,\
      \ setting new standards for computer hardware engineering and establishing benchmarks\
      \ for future game industry production. In the past few years, sophisticated\
      \ game AIs that are more entertaining than simple video game AIs of the past\
      \ have emerged and dominated the market. As 3D rendering hardware improves and\
      \ as the high-resolution quality of game graphics have become the <i>de facto</i>\
      \ industry standard, game AI has increasingly become one of the critical factors\
      \ determining a game's success. Programmers dedicated to just game AI are now\
      \ an integral part of the core design group.</p>\n<p>Programming game AI is\
      \ one of the most challenging enhancements that a game developer can engineer;\
      \ at the annual Game Developer Conference an increasing number of presentations\
      \ are concerned with AI techniques. The real-time performance requirements of\
      \ computer game AI and the demand for humanlike interactions, appropriate animation\
      \ sequences, and internal state simulations for populations of scripted agents\
      \ have impressively demonstrated the potential of academic AI research and game\
      \ AI technologies.</p>\n<p>The commercial success of licensed <b>game engines</b>\
      \ like Unreal Tournament have inspired an entire genre of First Person Shooter\
      \ designs that have incorporated increasingly sophisticated and expert agent\
      \ behaviors in their productions. The bots of Epic Games' Unreal Tournament\
      \ are well known for their scalability and tactical excellence. See, also, <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Bot_Support\" title=\"Legacy:Bot Support\">Bot Support</a></p>\n\
      <p>Hardware performance capabilities and constraints have been a persistent\
      \ bottleneck to the creation of advanced game AI. Real-time graphics rendering\
      \ has traditionally been a huge CPU hog, leaving insignificant time and memory\
      \ for game AI (and collision detection). Some fundamental AI problems, such\
      \ as pathfinding, can't be solved without adequate processor resources.</p>\n\

      \ expect that the next revolution in game AI will be learning and agent adaptation.\
      \ Developers have been pursuing and researching learning techniques. To be believable,\
      \ the AI in a game must simulate cognition, sense the environment realistically,\
      \ and act convincingly within that context. In defining game AI, the programmer\
      \ will have to code agent activity and behavior so that characters appear intelligent\
      \ and respond realistically to perceived conditions and situations.</p>\n<p>Ironically,\
      \ the simplest AI techniques – finite-state machines, decision trees, and production\
      \ rule systems – have been most successfully used by the game AI community.</p>\n\
      <p>The following is a listing of AI techniques that are relevant to present\
      \ and future game AI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Expert Systems</b> An expert system\
      \ represents expertise within a knowledge database and performs automated reasoning\
      \ in response to a series of queries.</li>\n<li><b>Finite-State Machines</b>\
      \ Simple, rule-based systems in which a finite number of \"states\" are connected\
      \ in a directed graph by \"transitions\" between states. Finite-State Machines\
      \ are the most used software AI in the computer game industry. They are easy\
      \ to program, simple to understand, and easy to debug.</li>\n<li><b>Production\
      \ Systems</b> Comprised of a database of associated rules. Rules are conditional\
      \ program statements with consequent actions that are performed if the specified\
      \ conditions are satisfied.</li>\n<li><b>Decision Trees</b> Data structute created\
      \ by an algorithm that outputs an activity decision based on automatic selection\
      \ from input data and a static node tree.</li>\n<li><b>Case-Based Reasoning</b>\
      \ Analysis of set of inputs and comparison to a database of possible situations\
      \ and advisable behavioral outputs.</li>\n<li><b>Genetic Algorithms</b> Genetic\
      \ Programming techniques attempt to imitate the dynamics of macro-evolution\
      \ by performing directed selection and modification on associations of programs,\
      \ sub-routines, and assemblages of parameters.</li>\n<li><b>Neural Networks</b>\
      \ Class of machine learning techniques based on the architecture of interconnected\
      \ neural components of a network. Operates through repeatedly adjusting internal\
      \ numeric parameters with the goal of optimizing response to a wide variety\
      \ of circumstances.</li>\n<li><b>Fuzzy Logic</b> Utilizes numeric values to\
      \ represent a degree of order in specified relationships or phenomena. The technique\
      \ allows for more expressive reasoning and greater subtlety and richness than\
      \ traditional Boolean or Bayesian inference.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The most successful\
      \ game AIs have emerged when developers clearly identified the specific subproblems\
      \ that game agents would be engaged in, and designed algorithms to optimize\
      \ AI responses to those situations. Essentially, game AI programmers attempt\
      \ to design agents that exhibit appropriate behaviors,...which appear to players\
