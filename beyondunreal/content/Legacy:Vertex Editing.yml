      <p><b>Sobiwan:</b> I still cant figure out what \"Alt-gr\" is. Anyone?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> \"Alt-gr is the right-hand Alt key on European keyboards.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Ironblayde:</b> Is there a way to do this numerically, i.e. select one\
      \ or more vertices and then enter the movement values in a console command?\
      \ I ocassionally find an excuse to use vertex editing with my grid resolution\
      \ set to 1, and it's about as much fun as... something really not fun.&#160;:)\
      \ I didn't see anything over at <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_2_Console\" title=\"\
      Legacy:UnrealEd 2 Console\">UnrealEd 2 Console</a>, but maybe someone knows\
      \ a trick.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I haven't tried <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush_Hacking\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Brush Hacking\">Brush Hacking</a>, so I don't know if it would\
      \ work for you, but it might be what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ AFAIK, there's no numerical option. As Foxpaw said, you can try hacking. Or\
      \ move your brushes back on grid!!&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>Random Guest:</b> There\
      \ should be a warning not to drag vertices on top of endpoints of the same brush\
      \ (like, you want to make a rectange into a triangle, from side-view). If you\
      \ try that, unrealed2 (maybe 3 too) will crash saying not enough vertices.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Winxp Rules:</b> If UnrealEd 2 keeps crashing on you when you want to\
      \ make triangles, try using the <a href=\"/Legacy:2D_Shape_Editor\" title=\"\
      Legacy:2D Shape Editor\">2D Shape Editor</a>. It might achieve what you need.\
      \ I've also tried what you describe in UnrealEd 3, and it doesn't crash, so\
      \ it's probably a glitch with UnrealEd 2 only.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Sometimes\
      \ in Vertex Edit mode the vertices no longer snap to the grid automatically\
      \ even though I didn't change anything I'd be aware of. Any idea how to turn\
      \ grid snapping back on without restarting UnrealEd? (The grid snapping for\
      \ actors and brushes is still enabled!)</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> I've seen this\
      \ happen too. And it seems related to other selection/manipulation errors that\
      \ occur with respect to grid lock. If I select multiple objects, the \"center\"\
      \ of the group is usually the center of the first object selected. However,\
      \ this \"center\" of my selection (whether a single object or group) can change\
      \ with a right-click. (I believe) IIRC, the same problem you're experiencing\
      \ happened to me after selecting multiple verticies while grid lock was on.\
      \ After a little manipulation, the \"center\" of my selection shifted (which\
      \ then snapped to grid) and suddenly all the points had selected were off. I\
      \ ended up scrapping the brush as soon as I identified the problem, so I could\
      \ start again. When this problem happens with brushes/objects, at least you\
      \ can manually set the Location under Movement. But with verticies... (?)</p>\n\
      <p><b>CygnusX1:</b> In UnrealEd 2 is there any easy way to move a vertex to\
      \ another vertex of a different brush when they are not snapped to grid? The\
      \ \"Vertex snap\" suggest it would do, but it snaps only the pivot point.</p>\n\
      <p>If there is, maybe it should be mentioned on this page how to achieve it.\
      \ If not... well... that would be strange.</p>\n<p><b>CanCauseCancer:</b> I\
      \ clean up (brush hack) my more difficult brushes with Notepad++ using the find/replace\
      \ with regular expressions. First I move the vertexes as closely as I can in\
      \ UnrealEd to where I need them then I export the brush as .t3d and open it\
      \ in Notepad++. I use the replace feature and check 'Regular Expression' and\
      \ search for things like \"\\.50\\d\\d\\d\\d\" and replace with: \".500000\"\
      \ or search \"2\\.1\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d\" and replace with \"2.100000\". What it\
      \ means is I'm searching search for \".50\" followed by 4 numbers (\\d) and\
      \ replacing it with .500000 so values like .053191, .051085, and .058209 will\
      \ all become .050000. Then I save and import it back into UnrealEd and adjust\
      \ things and export and do again until I'm satisifed with the result. An alternative\
      \ less manual method for a quick \"one regular to bind them all\" expression\
      \ you could search for: \"\\.(\\d\\d)\\d\\d\\d\\d\" and replace with \".\\10000\"\
      , what this means is 'Look for a period followed by any two numbers (\\d\\d)\
      \ and 4 numbers after that, and replace that with the period and those first\
      \ two numbers (\\1) and then 0000. Why does this work? It works because the\
      \ RegEx between the () brackets \"(\\d\\d)\" is represented by \"\\1\" in the\
      \ replace field. You can google Notepad++ help for more info. Periods require\
      \ a \\ infront of them because a period without a preceding a slash represents\
      \ 'any character'. You'll have to read up on regular expressions to understand\
      \ it.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.106 seconds\nReal\

      \ be moved at a time.  \n* Vertex Edit mode allows the rectangular marquee to\
      \ select multiple vertices.\n\n===Moving Stacked Vertices Simultaneously ===\n\
      \nBecause the 2D UnrealEd Viewport cannot display depth, sometimes your brush\
      \ will only show one vertex where 2 or more exist in 3D space.  This can be\
      \ demonstrated with a cube.  Choose the right mode depending if you want to\
      \ move one or more stacked vertices.\n* Camera mode selects only one vertex\n\
      * Vertex Edit mode selects all stacked vertices\n\n==Problems==\n* At 16 [[Legacy:Grid|grid]]\
      \ units or lower, dragging vertices zip around too fast\n* At 64 grid units\
      \ or higher, dragging vertices feel sticky\n* Therefore, 32 or 16 is best.\n\
      * Brushes can occasionally 'break' when vertex editing.  The cause for this\
      \ is unknown but the effect will likely result in a [[Legacy:BSP Hole|BSP Hole]].\n\
      \n==Related Topics ==\n* [[Legacy:UnrealEd Interface|UnrealEd Interface]] is\
      \ the main reference for the interface in general\n* Moving vertices is usually\
      \ done in one of the 2D [[Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport|UnrealEd Viewport]]s\n* [[Legacy:Toolbox|Toolbox]]\
      \ covers all the buttons down the left-hand side of the UnrealEd window\n* See\
      \ [[Legacy:Mouse Control|Mouse Control]] for more information on mouse actions\
      \ in different modes.\n\n==Comments==\n\n'''Sobiwan:''' I still cant figure\
      \ out what \"Alt-gr\" is.  Anyone?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' \"Alt-gr is the right-hand\
      \ Alt key on European keyboards.\n\n'''Ironblayde:''' Is there a way to do this\
      \ numerically, i.e. select one or more vertices and then enter the movement\
      \ values in a console command? I ocassionally find an excuse to use vertex editing\
      \ with my grid resolution set to 1, and it's about as much fun as... something\
      \ really not fun. :) I didn't see anything over at [[Legacy:UnrealEd 2 Console|UnrealEd\
      \ 2 Console]], but maybe someone knows a trick.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I haven't tried\
      \ [[Legacy:Brush Hacking|Brush Hacking]], so I don't know if it would work for\
      \ you, but it might be what you're looking for.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' AFAIK, there's\
      \ no numerical option. As Foxpaw said, you can try hacking. Or move your brushes\
      \ back on grid!! :D\n\n'''Random Guest:''' There should be a warning not to\
      \ drag vertices on top of endpoints of the same brush (like, you want to make\
      \ a rectange into a triangle, from side-view). If you try that, unrealed2 (maybe\
      \ 3 too) will crash saying not enough vertices.\n\n'''Winxp Rules:''' If UnrealEd\
      \ 2 keeps crashing on you when you want to make triangles, try using the [[Legacy:2D\
      \ Shape Editor|2D Shape Editor]]. It might achieve what you need. I've also\
      \ tried what you describe in UnrealEd 3, and it doesn't crash, so it's probably\
      \ a glitch with UnrealEd 2 only.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Sometimes in Vertex Edit mode\
      \ the vertices no longer snap to the grid automatically even though I didn't\
      \ change anything I'd be aware of. Any idea how to turn grid snapping back on\
      \ without restarting UnrealEd? (The grid snapping for actors and brushes is\
      \ still enabled!)\n\n'''SuperApe:''' I've seen this happen too.  And it seems\
      \ related to other selection/manipulation errors that occur with respect to\
      \ grid lock.  If I select multiple objects, the \"center\" of the group is usually\
      \ the center of the first object selected.  However, this \"center\" of my selection\
      \ (whether a single object or group) can change with a right-click. (I believe)\
      \  IIRC, the same problem you're experiencing happened to me after selecting\
      \ multiple verticies while grid lock was on.  After a little manipulation, the\
      \ \"center\" of my selection shifted (which then snapped to grid) and suddenly\
      \ all the points had selected were off.  I ended up scrapping the brush as soon\
      \ as I identified the problem, so I could start again.  When this problem happens\
      \ with brushes/objects, at least you can manually set the Location under Movement.\
      \  But with verticies... (?)\n\n'''CygnusX1:''' In UnrealEd 2 is there any easy\
      \ way to move a vertex to another vertex of a different brush when they are\
      \ not snapped to grid? The \"Vertex snap\" suggest it would do, but it snaps\
      \ only the pivot point.\n\nIf there is, maybe it should be mentioned on this\
      \ page how to achieve it. If not... well... that would be strange.\n\n'''CanCauseCancer:'''\
      \ I clean up (brush hack) my more difficult brushes with Notepad++ using the\
      \ find/replace with regular expressions. First I move the vertexes as closely\
      \ as I can in UnrealEd to where I need them then I export the brush as .t3d\
      \ and open it in Notepad++. I use the replace feature and check 'Regular Expression'\
      \ and search for things like \"\\.50\\d\\d\\d\\d\" and replace with: \".500000\"\
      \ or search \"2\\.1\\d\\d\\d\\d\\d\" and replace with \"2.100000\". What it\
      \ means is I'm searching search for \".50\" followed by 4 numbers (\\d) and\
      \ replacing it with .500000 so values like .053191, .051085, and .058209 will\
      \ all become .050000. Then I save and import it back into UnrealEd and adjust\
      \ things and export and do again until I'm satisifed with the result. An alternative\
      \ less manual method for a quick \"one regular to bind them all\" expression\
      \ you could search for: \"\\.(\\d\\d)\\d\\d\\d\\d\" and replace with \".\\10000\"\
      , what this means is 'Look for a period followed by any two numbers (\\d\\d)\
      \ and 4 numbers after that, and replace that with the period and those first\
      \ two numbers (\\1) and then 0000. Why does this work? It works because the\
      \ RegEx between the () brackets \"(\\d\\d)\" is represented by \"\\1\" in the\
      \ replace field. You can google Notepad++ help for more info. Periods require\
      \ a \\ infront of them because a period without a preceding a slash represents\
      \ 'any character'. You'll have to read up on regular expressions to understand\
      \ it.\n\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
