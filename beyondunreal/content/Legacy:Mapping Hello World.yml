      \ this page should have... please add / suggest / change</p>\n<p><b>Musicalglass:</b>\
      \ Might want to point out that this quick method of subclassing will not work\
      \ for all needs, such as working with animated skeletal meshes. List a few circumstances\
      \ where you might need to compile the long way and link to that bit and maybe\
      \ Playing Mesh Animations for a sample tutorial. I actually have a second tutorial\
      \ which I didn't post dealing with the second part of Playing Mesh Animations\
      \ using the simple mesh cube that comes with the editor. Most likely far too\
      \ wordy for your tastes, but I'd be happy to submit it for your review. I wanted\
      \ to take things like rotation and translational values and experiment with\
      \ doing simple scripting exercises such as how to add Touch or a Trigger or\
      \ script a sequence or call on different states. We need more practical examples\
      \ of simple scripts and maybe tie it in with one of these simple tutorials so\
      \ people can get their feet wet with coding with some kind of visual feedback\
      \ suitable for a gaming environment.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> This page seems\
      \ to need a little more explanation, a little more concepts and elements-type\
      \ stuff. I might suggest we use one of the <a href=\"/Legacy:Third-Party_Components\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Third-Party Components\">Third-Party Components</a> for the\
      \ \"Paste in a simple script\" step. We could have a <a href=\"/Legacy:RandomTrigger\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:RandomTrigger\">RandomTrigger</a> activate three colored <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:TriggerLight\" title=\"Legacy:TriggerLight\">TriggerLights</a>,\
      \ for example. And, the page title kind of threw me off, should it be more like,\
      \ \"Scripting Hello World\"?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Not really, the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:UnrealScript_Hello_World\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealScript Hello World\"\
      >UnrealScript Hello World</a> is a mutator.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ Note any <i>stock</i> Trigger will do (the work of the code above) if you\
      \ put, \"Hello World\" in the Trigger -&gt; Message property. Maybe we should\
      \ do something more custom.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> But then there wouldn't\
      \ be any scripting! The purpose of a 'Hello world' program is to be simple,\
      \ so I don't think something more custom would be suitable.</p>\n<p><b>StarWeaver:</b>\
      \ Personally, I wouldn't expect the *mapping* concept of Hello World to involve\
      \ scripting, just the minimum amount of complexity to create a functioning level;\
      \ e.g., perhaps, \"Select a texture that won't make you yark, subtract a standard\
      \ rectangular space, add a player start and one interactable object like a pickupbase.\"\
      </p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> That's <a href=\"/Legacy:Create_A_Room\" title=\"Legacy:Create\
      \ A Room\">Create a room</a>. basically, what I was trying to do here was starting\
      \ point for: 'Want some code in your map? Don't want to code a whole mutator\
      \ just to get started?'</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>&#160;:) I see the point of\
      \ using this page as a starting point for using custom scripts by mappers. I\
      \ see <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealScript_Hello_World\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealScript\
      \ Hello World\">UnrealScript Hello World</a> is a more advanced scripting tutorial.\
      \ (BTW, those should be linked as a series of \"Basic Procedure\"-like steps\
      \ for Modding from <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Mods\" title=\"Legacy:Making Mods\"\
      >Making Mods</a>, IMHO) I think my earlier comment about how this particular\
      \ code duplicated the functionality already available in Trigger was to be taken\
      \ together with the suggestion that we use one of the <u>simpler</u> scripts\
      \ from <a href=\"/Legacy:Third-Party_Components\" title=\"Legacy:Third-Party\
      \ Components\">Third-Party Components</a>. To me, to introduce scripting with\
      \ the above code to perform that function would be confusing a) the issue of\
      \ what a Trigger does by default and b) the issue of how one gets a custom actor\
      \ to display or broadcast a message. Although you're right, it is simple, it\
      \ doesn't actually hit the point of using custom code: to get extra functionality\
      \ not available in stock objects. Also, note that this code doesn't require\
      \ any other property settings, which as the steps above indicate, might be good\
      \ to include in a tutorial like this. As far as the name of the page, as long\
      \ as it's linked <i>to</i> well, it probably doesn't matter so much. But, on\
      \ the other hand, I might suggest \"Mappers Hello World\", to keep the idea\
      \ that this is a simpler version of scripting tutorial. That title sounds like,\
      \ \"Math for Artists\", to me and seems more appropriate. What does everyone\
      \ think of that?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Mapping\" title=\"\
