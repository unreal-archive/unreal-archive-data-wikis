      <p>Use BallSpawn4 to place balls. Balls can be assigned a team number (0-3),\
      \ or left neutral (255). If you play a game with the BR4 Team Balls option set\
      \ to None, then all balls will be neutral; otherwise, they will be as you placed\
      \ them in your map. You should of course have the same number for each team.\
      \ Your map can have any combination of team balls and neutral balls. The limit\
      \ is 8 balls in a map, but that should be plenty.</p>\n<p>You can specify when\
      \ certain balls will appear, depeding on the Team Balls setting. Set BombSpawn4-&gt;AppearForTeamOption\
      \ as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td><tt>app_All</tt></td>\n<td>Always appears</td>\n\
      </tr>\n<tr>\n<td><tt>app_AllTeam</tt></td>\n<td>Appears with Team Balls set\
      \ to either Pickup or Scoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><tt>app_None</tt></td>\n\
      <td>Only appears with Team Balls set to None</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><tt>app_Pickup</tt></td>\n\
      <td>Only appears with Team Balls set to Pickup</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><tt>app_Scoring</tt></td>\n\
      <td>Only appears with Team Balls set to Scoring</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>Notice\
      \ how this is done in BR4-TutorialClassic. There are 4 team balls, all set to\
      \ <tt>app_AllTeam</tt>. Then there are two neutral balls set to <tt>app_None</tt>.\
      \ In BR4-Chrome, there are 12 balls in the map, but no more than 6 will appear\
      \ at a time. It has two sets of team balls: Team Scoring balls near the center,\
      \ and Team Pickup balls closer to each base. There are four neutral balls, two\
      \ of which are set to <tt>app_None</tt>.</p>\n<p>You can also use this setting\
      \ to control which Team Balls settings can be used in your map, because it will\
      \ be automatically adjusted to make sure that at least one ball appears. For\
      \ example, if all balls in a map are set to <tt>app_Pickup</tt>, then the game\
      \ will automatically switch to Team Pickup balls for that map.</p>\n<h2><span\
