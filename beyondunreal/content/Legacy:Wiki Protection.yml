      \ were <i>extremely</i> slow at cleaning up; that guy only went on with his\
      \ vandalism because he (or she) saw that it had an actual, lasting <i>effect</i>.</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> One thing that might be worth considering is preventing\

      \ Or with a drastic amount of characters deleted.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Well...\
      \ all such purely technical measures are bound to be limited in effectiveness.\
      \ My recent edit of <a href=\"/Legacy:Offline_Wiki\" title=\"Legacy:Offline\
      \ Wiki\">Offline Wiki</a> was massive, yet legitimate. On the other hand it's\
      \ very easy to mess up a page without deleting a huge amount of text or the\
      \ entire page.</p>\n<p><b>CH3Z:</b> I was wondering if it would be possible\
      \ to have the Wiki automatically allow saves but imediately restore any pages\
      \ that were changed by a certain amount, or in a certain way. And somehow bring\
      \ the change to someone's attention (maybe the Wiki could put a code in this\
      \ summary. Then when someone clears say 40% or more of a page it would be approved\
      \ by (or seconded by any other user than the the one who made the changes) and\
      \ restored again to show the changes. That might be science fiction, or imossible,\
      \ or not worth the effort to make the change to the the Wiki, it might be too\
      \ big of an inconvenience all the way around. But it might lead other ideas\
      \ so i present it anyway. be kind =P</p>\n<p><b>CH3Z:</b> and with Mych's last\
      \ comment that might just say it all about my comment.<br />\nIt might be best\
      \ to just quickly and quietely restore behind the would be hackers. They will\
      \ see there fine work dissapear and not get any validating response from anyone\
      \ and get bored with doing it.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> I think the \"smart\
      \ firewall\" we have here (being all the well-meaning Wikizens) is the best\
      \ and most effective protection we could possibly have. Granted, it's a bit\
      \ annoying when it has to be invoked, but then again it's <i>our convenience</i>\
      \ that's at stake; I'd rather clean up manually after one or two wannabe haxx0rz\
      \ once every couple of weeks than go through a ton of technical security measures\
      \ every time I want to do anything on the Wiki. At least in average it is more\
      \ effort to vandalize a Wiki page than to restore it, so it really doesn't pay\
      \ off for the vandals.</p>\n<p>~<b>dUc0N:</b> You'd have to be some wannabe\
      \ to think attacking a wiki is cracking. Even bigger wannabe to think it's hacking&#160;;)</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> The above is pretty fair comment and I don't disagree\
      \ with it - which is why my suggested change was so limited in scope. Just thought\
      \ it might save other people a bit of work (since I always seem to miss these\
      \ attacks). Special case coding sucks.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> Making those\
      \ security measures is \"Bushlike\"</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> \"We must not live\

      <p><b>CH3Z:</b> Amen.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b>&#160;:)&#160;:tup:</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b>\
      \ The editing page says \"kids\". I find that insulting because most of the\
      \ people \"hacking\" the wiki are probably older than me by one or two years\
      \ (I'm 14). Though actually they're still kids, and I'm probably the only person\
      \ below 17 years of age that's been productive on this wiki. So I guess it's\
      \ true.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I don't think it means kids as in minors, I think\
      \ it means kids as in, \"script kiddies,\" which does not neccessarily imply\
      \ a certain age.</p>\n<p><b>Graphik:</b> Those who would 'hack' the Wiki are\
      \ either kids or are behaving like such, so I think it's a justly condecending\
      \ tone, T1.</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b> Yah, y'all are probably right, because usually\
      \ it's some 15-16 year old person doing to feel like they're cool/l33t or something.\
      \ And if they're kids that's implying that they're uncool.</p>\n<p><b>Fearless:</b>\
      \ I wouldn't take it personally T1. I think it's safe to say that adults have\
      \ their fair share of idiots too. Anyway, about documents, I think it would\
      \ be very useful to have a character count being displayed somewhere to see\
      \ if anything has been removed.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> When I was writing\
      \ \"kids\" there, I indeed meant it in terms of \"script kiddies,\" not to devaluate\
      \ young people – I know from personal experience that age isn't an indicator\
      \ for somebody's maturity or productivity. (If you take offense, feel free to\
      \ exchange it for a more neutral term.) However, I suppose that most script\
      \ kiddies are indeed young people – and sometimes, a script kiddy actually grows\
      \ to become a mature hacker (in the actual, positive meaning of that term),\
      \ but those cases are rare and there's a lot of real work between being a \"\
      skript kiddy\" and a \"mature hacker.\"</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Note to\

      \ I think we have a problem with images. There's a lot of spammy images, and\
      \ those we can go through and delete. But I've also seen people replace good\
      \ images with crud. Because there's no public log of image uploads, it's hard\
      \ to spot when this happens. I think the simplest thing to do for now would\
      \ be to have a web page or a wiki page that displays the image upload activity\
      \ log (knowing Mych, I'm sure it exists on the server&#160;:). In the longer\
      \ term, I think images should be brought into the wiki page structure, like\
      \ on Wikipedia: each image should have its own image description page, and changes\
      \ to images should appear on Recent Changes.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Actually, I've been pondering writing my own wiki engine for a while. If I\
      \ do, it'll definitely allow all sorts of resources (including images and attachments)\
      \ to be added and versioned just like wiki pages (actually, pages will be just\
      \ one other kind of resource). I'm thinking in terms of a Subversion backend,\
      \ but that's all still very vague.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Agreed&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Switch`:</b> The images page ranks pretty high in google. Maybe if it\
      \ was hidden from search bots there wouldn't be so many off-topic images. Putting\
      \ a big red \"offtopic images will be deleted!\" warning next to upload button\
      \ also could help.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> I don't believe in appealing to\
      \ people's common sense anymore (anybody reading the stuff on the image uploader\
      \ main page should immediately realize how futile unwanted uploads are, but\
      \ as you can see on <a href=\"/Legacy:Recent_Changes\" title=\"Legacy:Recent\
      \ Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Recent Changes</a>, there are almost a dozen\
      \ idiots a day who still try it). The <code>robots.txt</code> idea, however,\
      \ is a good one – I never realized that our image uploader ranked highly in\
      \ Google. (Which search terms do people use to get there?) I've now excluded\
      \ the image uploader pages and all images from being indexed.</p>\n<p><b>Switch`:</b>\
      \ On my box <code>wiki image</code> - 2nd place, <code>image uploader</code>\
      \ - 7th.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> That reminds me, I still have my work on a\

      \ that the ModSquad administrators were ''extremely'' slow at cleaning up; that\
      \ guy only went on with his vandalism because he (or she) saw that it had an\
      \ actual, lasting ''effect''.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' One thing that might be\
      \ worth considering is preventing a completely blank page from being saved.\
      \  Pages that are to be deleted will always be tagged with a [[:Category:Legacy\
      \ Delete Me]] tag and an explanation.\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Or with a drastic\
      \ amount of characters deleted.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Well... all such purely technical\
      \ measures are bound to be limited in effectiveness.  My recent edit of [[Legacy:Offline\
      \ Wiki|Offline Wiki]] was massive, yet legitimate.  On the other hand it's very\
      \ easy to mess up a page without deleting a huge amount of text or the entire\
      \ page.\n\n'''CH3Z:''' I was wondering if it would be possible to have the Wiki\
      \ automatically allow saves but imediately restore any pages that were changed\
      \ by a certain amount, or in a certain way. And somehow bring the change to\
      \ someone's attention (maybe the Wiki could put a code in this summary. Then\
      \ when someone clears say 40% or more of a page it would be approved by (or\
      \ seconded by any other user than the the one who made the changes) and restored\
      \ again to show the changes. That might be science fiction, or imossible, or\
      \ not worth the effort to make the change to the the Wiki, it might be too big\
      \ of an inconvenience all the way around. But it might lead other ideas so i\
      \ present it anyway. be kind =P\n\n'''CH3Z:''' and with Mych's last comment\
      \ that might just say it all about my comment.<br />It might be best to just\
      \ quickly and quietely restore behind the would be hackers. They will see there\
      \ fine work dissapear and not get any validating response from anyone and get\
      \ bored with doing it.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I think the \"smart firewall\" we\
      \ have here (being all the well-meaning Wikizens) is the best and most effective\
      \ protection we could possibly have.  Granted, it's a bit annoying when it has\
      \ to be invoked, but then again it's ''our convenience'' that's at stake; I'd\
      \ rather clean up manually after one or two wannabe haxx0rz once every couple\
      \ of weeks than go through a ton of technical security measures every time I\
      \ want to do anything on the Wiki.  At least in average it is more effort to\
      \ vandalize a Wiki page than to restore it, so it really doesn't pay off for\
      \ the vandals.\n\n~'''dUc0N:''' You'd have to be some wannabe to think attacking\
      \ a wiki is cracking. Even bigger wannabe to think it's hacking ;)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ The above is pretty fair comment and I don't disagree with it - which is why\
      \ my suggested change was so limited in scope.  Just thought it might save other\
      \ people a bit of work (since I always seem to miss these attacks).  Special\
      \ case coding sucks.\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Making those security measures is\
      \ \"Bushlike\"\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' \"We must not live in fear, for if we do then\
      \ the vandals have already won.\"  ;-)\n\n'''CH3Z:''' Amen. \n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:'''\
      \ :) :tup:\n\n'''T1:''' The editing page says \"kids\". I find that insulting\
      \ because most of the people \"hacking\" the wiki are probably older than me\
      \ by one or two years (I'm 14). Though actually they're still kids, and I'm\
      \ probably the only person below 17 years of age that's been productive on this\
      \ wiki. So I guess it's true.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I don't think it means kids as\
      \ in minors, I think it means kids as in, \"script kiddies,\" which does not\
      \ neccessarily imply a certain age.\n\n'''Graphik:'''  Those who would 'hack'\
      \ the Wiki are either kids or are behaving like such, so I think it's a justly\
      \ condecending tone, T1.\n\n'''T1:''' Yah, y'all are probably right, because\
      \ usually it's some 15-16 year old person doing to feel like they're cool/l33t\
      \ or something. And if they're kids that's implying that they're uncool.\n\n\
      '''Fearless:''' I wouldn't take it personally T1. I think it's safe to say that\
      \ adults have their fair share of idiots too. Anyway, about documents, I think\
      \ it would be very useful to have a character count being displayed somewhere\
      \ to see if anything has been removed.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' When I was writing\
      \ \"kids\" there, I indeed meant it in terms of \"script kiddies,\" not to devaluate\
      \ young people &ndash; I know from personal experience that age isn't an indicator\
      \ for somebody's maturity or productivity.  (If you take offense, feel free\
      \ to exchange it for a more neutral term.)  However, I suppose that most script\
      \ kiddies are indeed young people &ndash; and sometimes, a script kiddy actually\
      \ grows to become a mature hacker (in the actual, positive meaning of that term),\
      \ but those cases are rare and there's a lot of real work between being a \"\
      skript kiddy\" and a \"mature hacker.\"\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Note to remind\
      \ one of the admins to ban the IP: 62.37.193.96.  No username or password here\
      \ at work.\n\n===Images===\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I think we have a problem with\
      \ images. There's a lot of spammy images, and those we can go through and delete.\
      \ But I've also seen people replace good images with crud. Because there's no\
      \ public log of image uploads, it's hard to spot when this happens. I think\
      \ the simplest thing to do for now would be to have a web page or a wiki page\
      \ that displays the image upload activity log (knowing Mych, I'm sure it exists\
      \ on the server :). In the longer term, I think images should be brought into\
      \ the wiki page structure, like on Wikipedia: each image should have its own\
      \ image description page, and changes to images should appear on Recent Changes.\n\
      \n:'''Mychaeel:''' Actually, I've been pondering writing my own wiki engine\
      \ for a while.  If I do, it'll definitely allow all sorts of resources (including\
      \ images and attachments) to be added and versioned just like wiki pages (actually,\
      \ pages will be just one other kind of resource).  I'm thinking in terms of\
      \ a Subversion backend, but that's all still very vague.\n\n'''MythOpus:'''\
      \ Agreed :)\n\n'''Switch`:''' The images page ranks pretty high in google. Maybe\
      \ if it was hidden from search bots there wouldn't be so many off-topic images.\
      \ Putting a big red \"offtopic images will be deleted!\" warning next to upload\
      \ button also could help.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I don't believe in appealing to\
      \ people's common sense anymore (anybody reading the stuff on the image uploader\
      \ main page should immediately realize how futile unwanted uploads are, but\
      \ as you can see on [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent Changes]], there are almost\
      \ a dozen idiots a day who still try it).  The <code>robots.txt</code> idea,\
      \ however, is a good one &ndash; I never realized that our image uploader ranked\
      \ highly in Google.  (Which search terms do people use to get there?)  I've\
      \ now excluded the image uploader pages and all images from being indexed.\n\
      \n'''Switch`:''' On my box <code>wiki image</code> - 2nd place, <code>image\
      \ uploader</code> - 7th.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' That reminds me, I still have my\
      \ work on a wiki engine somewhere... :) I was going to make the database side\
      \ take plug-ins, so you could have the current UseMod textfile database system,\
      \ or something more advanced.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' This page has been locked due\
      \ to repeated spamming. Please contact a [[Legacy:Wiki Admin|Wiki Admin]] if\
