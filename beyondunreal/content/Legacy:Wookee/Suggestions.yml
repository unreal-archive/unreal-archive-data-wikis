    text: "==Borders on tables ==\n\nCurrent proposal: Tables whose rows end in another\
      \ <tt>{|\n\n|}\n</tt> character (which would normally simply be ignored) will\
      \ have a border, those created in <tt>{|\n\n|-\n|blah\n|bleh\n|}\n</tt> style\
      \ without a trailing <tt>{|\n\n|}\n</tt> won't. The first line is authoritative.\
      \ \n\nTables with corders currently produce just a grey background. Tarquin\
      \ is working on the CSS...\n\nThe CSS classes are now:\n* \"paratable\" no border\n\
      * \"paratable-border\"\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I actually think that most tables\
      \ don't need any borders at all and actually look better without (like the one\
      \ on [[Legacy:Font Colors|Font Colors]], for instance).\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Maybe\
      \ we can do something discreet, like pale grey borders, or white borders & pale\
      \ grey background. Just something to help the eye follow the lines of the table.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:'''  See [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?threadid=116120\
      \ 116120].\n\n==Forum links ==\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Provide forum links for every\
      \ page (to a pre-filled \"New Thread\" window or an existing thread).  See [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?threadid=116130\
      \ 116130].\n\nSee [[Legacy:Wiki Development|Wiki Development]]\n\n==Header numbering\
      \ ==\n\nWould it be difficult to implement heading numering thus:\n === # header\
      \ ===\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Not at all (since headers only take inline markup\
      \ anyway).  That's actually a nifty idea.  Create a numbering along the lines\
      \ of 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1 starting at header level 2?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I hadn't\
      \ thought of multi-level, but yes, that could be useful. Just for the headers\
      \ that request it with the #. Alternatively, the nesting could left to the user\
      \ with #, ##, ### etc.\n\n'''WheatPuppet:''' Okay, I'm seeing 1.1, 1.2, 1.3,\
      \ how do you get a 2.1 or a 2.5.1?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  By adding the corresponding\
      \ numbered headings... like in a word processor.  See the [[Legacy:Sandbox|Sandbox]].\n\
      \n====Tarquin says ====\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Oops! Just saw in [[Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Viewport|UnrealEd Viewport]] that there's a patch I applied to UMW I forgot\
      \ to mention for Wookee support: arbitrary counters &ndash; see http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WikiPatches/SeparateCounters\n\
      \n====Mychaeel replies ====\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Interesting and very easy to\
      \ implement in Wookee, but &ndash; what for, exactly?  (I'm just curious.)\n\
      \n====Tarquin concedes ====\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Erm, for being lazy when numbering\
      \ headers... hm. I see your point.\n\n====Mychaeel announces ====\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \  Heading numbering works now.  Automatically generated table of contents is\
      \ just a step away (see the [http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/playground.cgi\
      \ Wookee Playground]).\n\n====Tarquin jubilantly says ====\n\nwahey!!!\n\n==Table\
      \ of contents ==\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  I've had the idea of automatically generating\
      \ a table of contents for each page according to the headers found there, linked\
      \ to the corresponding parts of the page.  That table of contents could either\
      \ be displayed in a floating block in the page's upper-right corner, or be displayed\
      \ in a drop-down box, or (with the help of some DHTML) pop up menu-like.  What\
      \ do you think?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  See [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?threadid=116360\
      \ 116360].\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''   They're in and up and working &ndash; even on\
      \ all browsers I'm aware of (and despite the fact that one thing I'm relying\
      \ on isn't part of any standard [yet] &ndash; <code>offsetParent</code>, <code>offsetLeft</code>\
      \ and related attributes are supported by Mozilla, Internet Explorer and Opera\
      \ though).  Select the ''Chilled Blue'' style to see the ''Quick Navigation''\
      \ menu, and check the forum thread for information how to enable the other skins\
      \ as well.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  this is a minor point which I don't expect there\
      \ is a fix for, nor should we bother trying to find one: they don't work on\
      \ MacIE or OmniWeb, but Mac Mozilla is fine :) (but Mac Mozilla fails on other\
      \ stuff, like wheel mice, and command-key shortcuts... sigh)\n\n==Arrows for\
      \ properties ==\n\nLatest consensus on [[Legacy:Guidelines On Technical Names|Guidelines\
      \ On Technical Names]] was to use \"Advanced -> bStatic\" for prop names. Mychaeel\
      \ suggested that the arrow pair could be parsed into an image. The following\
      \ HTML entity could also be an option, thus:\n: Advanced &rarr; bStatic\n\n\
      '''Mychaeel:'''  Very nice!  I'm going to implement that (maybe for &rArr; (<code>&rArr;\
      \ =></code>) and &hArr; (<code>&hArr; <=></code>) and all the other nice arrows\
      \ from [[Legacy:Wiki Markup|Wiki Markup]] as well...).\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Any\
      \ idea for replacing <code>>></code> (for class paths)?\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Ah\
      \ be careful with the <code>=>=</code> arrows. I get little squares instead\
      \ of them. (IE and Opera)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' On my Win98, &rarr; works in all\
      \ 3 browsers. On my Win98, &rArr; and &hArr; produce \"?\" in Mo, and boxes\
      \ in IE and Opera\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  What a pity... guess it'll just be <code>->-</code>\
      \ then.  :-/  (All three arrows work fine on Windows 2000 here, by the way.)\
      \  No thoughts on <code>>></code>?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Done.  <code>->-</code>\
      \ yields a nice -> now.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' You could replace <code>>></code> with\
      \ &raquo; (<code>&raquo;</code>), but it doesn't look that good.\n\n==Whitespace\
      \ paragraphs ==\n\n'''Tarquin:''' This isn't a bug, so much as user sloppiness\
      \ that Wookee could turn a blind eye to. A single stray space character on a\
      \ line creates a whitespace paragraph. It might be an idea to only create on\
      \ if there are characters following the initial whitespace.\n\n==Signing & Thread\
      \ mode ==\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'll take another look at the hack I impleneted\
      \ which transformed three \"~\" characters into a user name. At the moment it\
      \ just adds the user name, with a dash before it if used at the end of a line.\n\
      \nA possible extension would be if used at the start of a paragraph, it could\
      \ create a header rule, the user name in bold, and a \":\". This would greatly\
      \ simplify thread mode.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  That's not Wookee-related.  That\
      \ has to be done statically, before the page is saved. &ndash; If you include\
      \ the colon, ''please'' make it part of the boldfaced text.  It looks so ugly\
      \ otherwise...\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Indeed. But from the POV of the user it's part\
      \ of markup. Colon in boldface: will do.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Alright.  :)  I\
      \ just wondered why you put this item in [[Legacy:Wookee/Suggestions|Wookee/Suggestions]],\
      \ but I think there's indeed currently no other place that's better suited for\
      \ stuff like that. &ndash; Whether the <code><hr></code> is really necessary\
      \ I don't know.  I actually like the more compact way we're discussing in here\
      \ better.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Done. I thought the same thing about the headers,\
      \ so they're not included. If a writer has no username, they are parsed as \"\
      Guest\".\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Let's see. &ndash; Not bad.  Whether it be a <code>----</code>\
      \ (without a trailing space, my personal favorite) or a <code>----</code> (your\
      \ choice) is a matter of personal preference, I suppose, and I can live with\
      \ that.  What about linking non-Guest usernames though instead of putting them\
      \ in italics?  <code>[[Legacy:Mychaeel|Mychaeel]]</code>\n\n'''Tarquin:''' \
      \ without the trailing space the <nowiki>----</nowiki> won't be parsed into\
      \ &ndash; . End of line signoff is done.  &ndash; [[Legacy:Tarquin|Tarquin]]\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:'''   Believe me, it will.  I coded it, I ought to know.  :) \
      \ &rarr;yadda&rarr; &ndash;yoo&ndash;  &ndash; [[Legacy:Mychaeel|Mychaeel]]\
      \ \n\n'''Tarquin:'''  OK, in that case I'll change it so there's no space between\
      \ the &ndash; and the name. Egad, you've found a way to escape it!!! I was trying\
      \ to code a way to use a backslash in front, which worked, but then of course\
      \ the marrkup parser needs to be told to ignore the backslash if it finds it....\
      \ Space removed  &ndash;[[Legacy:Tarquin|Tarquin]] \n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  An m-dash\
      \ instead of the n-dash would be nifty.  :-) &ndash; About escaping:  Don't\
      \ you think it'd be sufficient to substitute <code>~</code><code>~~</code> solely\
      \ at paragraph starts and ends?  That'd make escaping unnecessary in most cases\
      \ and keep the feature anyway.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  both changes made. ~~~ now\
      \ unparsed.  &rarr;[[Legacy:Tarquin|Tarquin]] \n\n==Run-in headers ==\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ This is a formatting style demonstrated here that I've seen people use. It's\
      \ possible to create this with CSS with display:run-in. I haven't tested all\
      \ browsers, but if it works, we could provide it as a formatting option. Then\
      \ again, it might be featuritis. Something like one of:\n ==: heading ==\n ==\
      \ heading ==:\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  I don't understand.  How's that supposed to\
      \ look?\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Like the example that you changed.... ;) Like the\
      \ \"A few tips:\" bit on [[Legacy:UT Troubleshooting FAQ|UT Troubleshooting\
      \ FAQ]]. I'm not sure it's useful, it just occured to me when I saw that page,\
      \ as I've been reading up on the CSS display property lately.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \  Hmm... well, if it can be done in CSS, why not.  Since the trailing <code>----</code>\
      \ is optional anyway for headings in Wookee, I think <code>==heading : ==</code>\
      \ would do better for the syntax though...\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  OK. I'll make\
      \ some test styles.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''   Thinking of it, <code>===heading===</code>\
      \ (without the trailing <code>----</code>) might even be better...\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \  <code>display:run-in</code> only works with Opera. Sigh.\n\n==Boldface Markup\
      \ ==\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Currently only <code>'''...'''</code> produces boldface\
      \ text.  How about introducing <code>*...*</code> as an alternative?  (Perhaps\
      \ requiring a match on <code>/\\*\\S/</code> for the start tag and <code>/\\\
      S\\*/</code> for the end tag?)\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  wouldn't that create problems\
      \ with bullet lines? I'm not sure we need a shorthand for bold, but how about\
      \ _bold_ ?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Paragraph markup has precedence over character\
      \ markup, so the only thing you wouldn't be able to do is ''starting'' a paragraph\
      \ with <code>*boldfaced*</code> text.  Having this markup for <code>*boldfaced*</code>\
      \ text means typing four characters less than <code>'''boldfaced'''</code> text...\n\
      \n'''Wormbo:''' That looks more like _underlined_. Introducing *bold* would\
      \ also allow to format text as *''bold and italic''*. (or ''*italic and bold*''\
      \ &ndash; whatever you like better :D)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Introducing <code>_underlined_</code>\
      \ wouldn't be a technical problem either (I'd rather not do it though &ndash;\
      \ underlined text on a web page is confusing if it's not a link), but seeing\
      \ constructions like <code>*''bold and italic''*</code> I'm not so sure about\
      \ the whole approach at all anymore...  Wiki markup should be logical, not physical,\
      \ I believe.\n\n==Floating Images ==\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Please see [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?threadid=118820\
      \ 118820] for a suggestion about how to handle floating images (<code>@left@imageid</code>\
      \ and <code>@right@imageid</code>) and a request for comments.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \  Floating images are now (much more neatly) implemented by means of HTML tables.\
      \  Internet Explorer's speshul notion of CSS gave me some trouble, but I was\
      \ able to devise a workaround that is, at least, still okay with CSS-compliant\
      \ browsers.\n\n==InterWiki ==\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  just realised: I can't install\
      \ InterWiki, because links are now handled by Wookee... I'm not sure if there\
      \ is an established format for this on wikis that use Freelinks... I guess <nowiki>[[Wikipedia:some\
      \ page]]<nowiki> would be logical. BTW, does Wookee support CamelCase links?\
      \ Not that I'm thinking we should use them. :)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  I ignored\
      \ CamelCase links when I implemented the link formatter.  Wouldn't be hard to\
      \ refit though. &ndash; Page links are only partly handled by Wookee; it still\
      \ calls <code>UseModWiki::FreeToNormal</code> to convert them to actual HTML\
      \ links.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Interwiki now installed. I'll refactor this section\
      \ to some other page to explain how to use it.\n\n==ColSpan ==\n\nJust an idea\
      \ for rowspan markup:\n | cell one |_ spans two rows | cell 3\n | row 2 cell\
      \ one | <- should there be a second \"|\" to indicate the spanned cell? HTML\
      \ syntax would say no, so this is row 2 cell 3"
