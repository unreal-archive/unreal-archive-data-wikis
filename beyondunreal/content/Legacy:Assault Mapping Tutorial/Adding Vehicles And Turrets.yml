      \n==Setting Up a vehicle==\n\nWhen placing an ONS vehicle (the standard ones)\
      \ in an AS map there are no specific factories for each of the vehicles they\
      \ must be set in a property of an ASVehicleFactory. Unless you set it up in\
      \ the display options there will only be an actor in the UEd [[Legacy:Viewport|viewport]]\
      \ until the vehicle spawns inside the actual game.\n\nVehicles designed only\
      \ for assault though (the turrets) have individual factories, this will be discussed\
      \ further on.\n\n===Placing the actor===\n\nGo into the actor browser and in\
      \ Actor>>SVehicle there will be ASVehicleFactory take this and put one into\
      \ your map (use the root level of this to add a standard vehicle)\n\nIt will\
      \ appear as a car icon and when the paths are rebuilt a navigation point will\
      \ appear under it\n\n===Setting which Vehicle you want===\n\nTo set which vehicle\
      \ to use go to the SVehicleFactory sub-menu and select in the vehicleclass list.\
      \ See [[Legacy:Vehicle Gameplay|Vehicle Gameplay]] for the names that you should\
      \ use.\n\n===Properties that you might want to change===\n\nOpen the properties\
      \ of the ASVehicleFactory and browse the the ASVehicleFactory sub-menu there\
      \ are a list of options all unique to the assault gametype:\n; bEnterteamunlocks\
      \ : If the vehicle is locked (when bVehicleTeamLock is set to true) the vehicle\
      \ will unlock if a player gets in and out of the vehicle and this is set to\
      \ true\n; bVehicleTeamLock : When the vehicle spawns and this is set to true\
      \ only the team specified in VehicleTeam will be able to enter it\n; bRespawnwhenDestroyed\
      \ : When set to true the vehicle will respawn when it is destroyed after the\
      \ time specified in the RespawnDelay field\n; bSpawnProtected : If set to true\
      \ the vehicle cannot be damaged before a player enters it\n; VehicleHealth :\
      \ You can specify the health of the vehicle here if you don't want it at the\
      \ default specified in coding (setting it to 0 will be default)\n; VehicleTeam\
      \ : Sets the initial team of the vehicle (see bEnterteamunlocks) 0 = Attackers,\
      \ 1 = Defenders\n\nThat's about it for setting up a basic vehicle, there is\
      \ a list of other properties and what they do further down\n\n==Setting up a\
      \ Sentinel or Turret==\n\nTo place a sentinel or turret expand the ASVehicleFactory\
      \ branch and place one of the following:\n* ASVehicleFactory_IonCannon - Massive\
      \ Ion Cannon (as in RobotFactory)\n* ASVehicleFactory_MinigunTurret - (As in\
      \ Convoy)\n* ASVehicleFactory_SentinelCeiling - You cannot get into these and\
      \ are generally used as spawn protection or objectives to destroy\n* ASVehicleFactory_SentinelFloor\
      \ - As above but you place them of the floor\n* ASVehicleFactory_Turret - Turrets\
      \ as in the ones on Mothership\n* ASVehicleFactory_LinkTurret - Link Turrets\
      \ - can heal other vehicles but also destroy them very quickly\n\nOnce place\
      \ they can be setup as in the vehicles section but there are a few more properties\
      \ to take into account for turrets\n\n; AIVisiblity : This is how far the turret\
      \ (and bots in it) can 'see' - If it is a sentinel, link turret or a mothership\
      \ turret it will automatically shoot at anyone in the other team within that\
      \ range (the others will not) setting it to 0 will mean that it will not automatically\
      \ shoot at anyone. In other turrets it will limit how far the bot can 'see'\
      \ and fire at targets.\n\n===Making bots use turrets===\n\nBots will not use\
      \ the control panels (below) and therefore will never use the Mothership Turrets\
      \ (ASVehicleFactory_Turret) and Link Turrets (ASVehicleFactory_LinkTurret).\
      \ You therefore need to set the AIVisiblity (see above) if you want the turrets\
      \ to fire in bot matches.\n\nBots will manually get into both the ion cannon\
      \ and minigun turrets if both of the following apply:\n* There is a path to\
      \ the turret and space to get in (applies mostly to ion cannon as you can only\
      \ get in at the ladder)\n* The current objectives tag is listed under ASVehicleFactory_IonCannon/MinigunTurret\
      \ (maximum of 6 objectives - cannot be increased without recoding)\n\n===Making\
      \ the turret 'remote controlled'===\n\nIf you want the turret to be controlled\
      \ through a wall panel (as in mothership) you have to do the following:\n\n\
      * Place a Triggers>>SVehicleTrigger>>Trigger_ASUseandPossess>>Trigger_ASTurretControlPanel\n\
      \nSet the following properties in the Trigger_ASTurretControlPanel:\n; Trigger_ASUseandPossess>>AssaultTeam\
      \ : Only the team (or all) will be able to use this panel\n; Trigger_ASUseandPossess>>PawnTag\
      \ : This must be the same as the ASVehicleFactory>>VehicleTag of the turret\n\
      \n* Make sure that in addition to setting the Trigger_ASUseandPossess>>AssaultTeam\
      \ that you set the team correctly on the turret itself (see above (bVehicleTeamLock\
      \ etc.) as you either may not be able to get into the turret using the panel.\n\
      * You can also get into both the link turrets and Mothership turrets manually\
      \ (if the bVehicleTeamLock etc... (see above) is set correctly) by standing\
      \ on top of the turret and pressing your 'use' key\n* You can only remote control\
      \ the mothership turrets and link turrets the others will not work!\n\n==Making\
      \ the Vehicle Spawn or 'Unspawn' when triggered==\n\nThis applies to both sentinels,\
      \ turrets and vehicles.\n\n* bEnabled states if the vehicle will spawn at the\
      \ beginning of the game. If not true it will only spawn when triggered and depending\
      \ on the TriggeredFunction may change during the game.\n* TriggeredFunction\
      \ can be set in one of the following states\n** EVASF_ToggleEnabled - When the\
      \ factory is triggered it will switch between being enabled and disabled (depending\
      \ on what bEnabled starts at)\n** EVASF_TriggeredSpawn - When the factory is\
      \ triggered it will switch between being enabled and disabled (depending on\
      \ what bEnabled starts at) BUT WILL DESTROY THE VEHICLE WHEN DISABLED!!!\n\n\
      ===Force Destroy===\n\nWhen a factory is triggered from enabled to disabled\
      \ it will not destroy the vehicle but only stop it from respawning when it is\
      \ next destroyed. This means that if you want to force a vehicle to destroy\
      \ you must do the following. In the PlayerSpawnManager used previously in the\
      \ tutorial there is a field called DisabledVehicleFactoriesTag adding a field\
      \ here and entering the Events>>Tag of any VehicleFactory, when the PlayerSpawnManager\
      \ is disabled the vehicle will not only vanish (no explosions) but the factory\
      \ will set bEnabled to false. Which is essential when using sentinel for spawn\
      \ areas that are used by both teams.\n\n==Extra Properties==\n\nThese might\
      \ be useful when doing more complex things with vehicles\n\n; AIVisibility :\
      \ only used for turrets (see below)\n; Announcement_Destroyed : Put the name\
      \ of a sound file in here and when the vehicle is destroyed everyone will here\
      \ it\n; bHighScoreKill : When set to true this will earn the person who destroys\
      \ the vehicle a trophy and some points\n; bHUDTrackVehicle : When set to true\
      \ the vehicle will have a visible icon on the HUD showing health and position\
      \ (It is only posible to have one vehicle (that is spawned) at a time with this,\
      \ if you have more than one it will rotate as the vehicle with it dies)\n; bKeyVehicle\
      \ : When set to true the vehicle will have a health bar above it for all players\n\
      ; bSpawnBuildEffect : When the vehicle is about to spawn or respawn you will\
      \ get the nice red or blue rings and a warning if you are in the way (the time\
      \ of the warning can be set in MaxSpawnBlockCount (in seconds))\n; VehicleEvent\
      \ : This is triggered when the vehicle is destroyed\n; VehicleLinkHealMult :\
      \ How much the link gun heals the vehicle, 0 = link gun won't heal it, 1 = link\
      \ gun will heal vehicles very quickly\n\nThe few that I have left out need only\
      \ be changed in very strange circumstances...\n\nIf you need help please email\
      \ blip2@dogmatix.net or comment below - I check fairly regularly.\n\n==Discussion==\n\
      \n'''SuperApe:''' This is an excellent series of tutorials.  Well done.\n\n\
