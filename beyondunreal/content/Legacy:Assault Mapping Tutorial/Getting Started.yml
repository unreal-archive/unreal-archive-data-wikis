      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Assault mapping is easily the most complex and demanding\
      \ of any of the game types to map for. This is because it requires not only\
      \ most of the skills needed to make all of the other map types combined, but\
      \ also throws in quite a few quirks of its own. Tempting though it may be, do\
      \ not try to make an assault map for your first ever mapping experience. Instead,\
      \ it is strongly recommended that you have some experience mapping several other\
      \ game types and have all the basics down before you start considering an assault\
      \ map.</p>\n<p>That having been said, while assault mapping is one of the most\
      \ challenging forms of mapping for UT2004, it can also be very rewarding. There\
      \ are a few things to keep in mind when starting out, however:</p>\n<h2><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Planning_the_Map\">Planning the Map</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\

      Edit section: Planning the Map\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Ok, so you're starting a new map. The first thing\
      \ to do is fire up UnrealEd, right? <i>Wrong.</i> You're not just making another\
      \ Capture the Flag, or even Onslaught, map here. This is Assault, and Assault\
      \ takes planning. If you want your map to be any good at all you'll need to\
      \ start thinking about a lot of details before you sit down to start building.</p>\n\
      <p>Get out a pencil and pad of paper (or a text editor and a drawing program\
      \ if you prefer). You're going to need it.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"Backstory\">Backstory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Assault_Mapping_Tutorial/Getting_Started?section=3\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Backstory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>For a lot of folks, this seems like something that\
      \ should be an afterthought at most. This is Unreal Tournament. You go around\
      \ and shoot people. Who cares about a story? And this is pretty much true for\
      \ most of the other game types out there, but for assault, having an idea for\
      \ a bit of backstory and premise for your map before you begin is really one\
      \ of the first things you should do, and can be surprisingly important.</p>\n\
      <p>A backstory can provide several key factors for your map creation:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>It can give you a good key as to what the world should look and feel\
      \ like, and more importantly what the obstacles are and where you should be\
      \ placing them. What would attackers realistically need to do in this scenario?\
      \ How would the defenders try to stop them? Consistent goals that fit with a\
      \ premise can not only improve the believability for the players, but often\
      \ help with balance and timing issues later on.</li>\n<li>As a corrolary to\
      \ the previous point, a backstory can give players a better intuitive feel for\
      \ how the level works and what they'll need to accomplish. An assault level\
      \ where the goals seem to be completely arbitrary and confusingly placed can\
      \ be very frustrating to play. On the other hand, if the player starts out with\
      \ an idea of what the map is all about, and where they need to go and what they\
      \ need to do at each stage flow naturally from that foundation, it can make\
      \ playing less confusing and more enjoyable for everyone involved.</li>\n<li>A\
      \ backstory that the player can really get into can give a map a lot more depth\
      \ and make it much more compelling to play. This is actually one of the big\
      \ advantages to the Assault gametype. The degree to which the gameplay is customized\
      \ to each map can make each one a lot more interesting than the \"same game\
      \ with new scenery\" effect one typically gets with new maps for most other\
      \ gametypes. Exploit this fact and build from it to create a compelling world\
      \ for your participants to be part of and it will only enhance the game that\
      \ much more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, that having been said, here's a few questions\
      \ you'll want to answer before you start:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are these people?\
      \ Are the teams military troops on a campaign? Bands of citizens in a lawless\
      \ world trying to survive? Eco-terrorists fighting to save a cute fuzzy animal?\
      \ There are more possibilities than you might think at first glance.</li>\n\
      <li>How did they get here? Is this the culmination to a great crusade across\
      \ half a planet? Did the attackers just parachute in from orbital drop-ships?\
      \ Did a covert op go bad and now one team is stuck deep inside enemy territory?</li>\n\
      <li>Why is the other team trying to stop them? Defenders are people too, and\
      \ they have their own stories.</li>\n<li>What happens when the attackers succeed\
      \ with their mission? What does this mean for the larger universe?</li>\n<li>What\
      \ happens when the defenders succeed in stopping them?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Think\
      \ about details. Write it all down in a few paragraphs. You'll be glad you did\
      \ later. (Note that this shouldn't be set in stone, though. You may well need\
      \ to go back and revisit this premise and tweak some things here and there as\
      \ you're building the map. That's a natural part of the building process too.)</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Assault_Mapping_Tutorial/Getting_Started?section=4\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Objectives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Now that you've got a good idea of what the story\
      \ behind your scenario is, it's time to start thinking in mapper terms. Your\
      \ story should already have given you a few ideas about what obstacles and objectives\
      \ are going to be involved in the assault. Now you need to think about how you're\
      \ going to implement them.</p>\n<p>Take a good read through the rest of this\
      \ tutorial with an eye to the types of objectives you have to work with. For\
      \ your map you'll likely want somewhere between five and ten objectives from\
      \ beginning to end. How many depends a lot on how the gameplay works out and\
      \ how long it takes people to get through them, so you may need to adjust things\
      \ as you go. Pick four or five really important objectives that exemplify what\
      \ the story is all about, and then think about places you might add more or\
      \ ways you might substitute alternates if it looks like the gameplay needs it.\
      \ You want to get a starting plan, but don't get too tied down to anything at\
      \ this stage, because you never know what you might have to change later.</p>\n\
      <p>It's very important here to think about the timing of your objectives. To\
      \ maintain a consistent feel of progress and keep the game fun, you want the\
      \ objectives to be well spread out over the progress of the level, so there\
      \ aren't any places where people feel like they're whizzing through things or\
      \ bogged down in one place forever. Also keep an eye on the total game time.\
      \ The default time in the game for one round of an Assault map is ten minutes,\
      \ and this is a good ballpark to shoot for. Too much shorter than this and people\
      \ won't feel they've really accomplished anything. Too much longer than this,\
      \ and people will start wondering if they'll ever see the end of things. Got\
      \ too many ideas for a ten-minute map? That's ok, that just gives you more to\
      \ start with when you get to making your next map! There's always a next map,\
      \ so don't blow all your good ideas at once.</p>\n<p>Ok, got your basic objectives?\
      \ Take a minute to think about the requirements that your objectives will have\
      \ in order to be challenging, but not impossible. If you've got a destroyable\
      \ objective, for example, you don't want it in plain sight where the attackers\
      \ can just shoot it from their spawn points. You need something in the way that\
      \ they'll have to navigate past to get to where they can attack the target.\
      \ Have a HoldObjective? You need to put it somewhere where the defenders can\
      \ try to blow away the person who's getting too close to it, but at the same\
      \ time you don't want it so defensible that the attackers never get near it.\
      \ Take some ideas from other maps that work well, too. Once you've got some\
      \ basic ideas for how you'll do all this, this should lead you right into the\
      \ next step...</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Layout\">Layout</span><span\

      Edit section: Layout\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Now it's time to start putting everything together into an actual map. From\
      \ your backstory you've probably already got an idea of what the scenery should\
      \ look like. From your objectives, you have some idea of how the gameplay will\
      \ need to progress, and what sort of obstacles you'll want to have in the way.\
      \ Next you'll want to think about travel.</p>\n<p>One of the challenging aspects\
      \ of Assault is that the attackers need to manage to push their way through\
      \ the defense to get at the objective, and this usually means a lot of running,\
      \ dodging, shooting, and so on (you know, the fun stuff). To do that we're going\
      \ to need some distance between the attackers' spawn point and the objective\
      \ under attack. For each stage, you'll want some room to maneuver, and you might\
      \ have a good number of people on each team, so think fairly open spaces. On\
      \ the other hand, you'll want to include some objects to duck behind, navigate\
      \ around, jump from, and otherwise make things interesting. For at least some\
      \ of your objectives, try to come up with a couple of different routes to get\
      \ to them. This adds uncertainty for both the attackers and defenders and can\
      \ make the game more interesting. Be careful with more than two routes, however,\
      \ since if you're not careful this can make things very frustrating for the\
      \ defenders and very easy for the attackers. Also be really careful of \"sneaky\"\
      \ routes. Often they seem like a neat way to add a clever twist to the attack,\
      \ but a secret attack route that none of the defenders know about can let the\
      \ attackers just breeze through, and that's no fun for the defense.</p>\n<p>You'll\
      \ also want to think about where the spawn points for the attackers and defenders\
      \ will be. You want to make sure there's a fair amount of room, because you\
      \ might have a large number of players on each team, but you also want to make\
      \ them somewhat protected, so one side can't just start shooting at the other\
      \ as soon as they spawn (the attackers need a chance to get near the objective,\
      \ and the defenders need time to get ready for them). You'll also want to put\
      \ the defender spawn point a little bit out of the way of the battle, so that\
      \ they aren't respawning right on top of rocket blasts.</p>\n<p>For each stage\
      \ of the assault, draw out a rough sketch of the layout of that area. Plot out\
      \ your anticipated attack routes, and figure out where good places would be\
      \ for the defenders to lie in wait. This will come in handy later when you get\
      \ to bot pathing, and it also gives you a chance to keep an eye on balance.</p>\n\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Now if you've been thinking carefully about all of\
      \ the bits up to this point, you've probably already got this mostly covered,\
      \ but this is still the time to stop, step back from all your plans, and look\
      \ at the whole map from the perspective of the players on both sides. Are all\
      \ the objectives achievable within the game's time limit? Are they defendable\
      \ for long enough to keep the attackers at bay until the time runs out? Are\
      \ there any things you're going to want to be careful of that might tip the\
      \ balance one way or the other while building the map?</p>\n<p>There are always\
      \ some little balance issues and question marks at the end of planning. Just\
      \ keep them in mind as you actually build the map, and with a little fiddling\
      \ you can probably work them out as you go. You can't fix what you don't know\
      \ is a problem, though, so try to make sure you know where your gremlins are\
      \ beforehand so you're ready for them when you get to that part of the map.</p>\n\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Creating the Basic Map\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Ok, now for the fun part. We get to start building!\
      \ You've already got a good idea for what you want your map to look like, and\
      \ you're familiar with all the basics from your previous experience building\
      \ other maps, so I won't bore you with a lot of details here. For the purposes\
      \ of our example, we'll use a fairly simple scenario. The first thing we'll\
      \ need is a backstory, perhaps something like:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\"\
      >\n<p>Over a period of many years, a ruthless band of criminal thugs have been\
      \ building a stronghold in the mountains of an otherwise peaceful farming planet\
      \ towards the outer rim. Recently, these thugs have taken advantage of the military's\
      \ preoccupation with an uprising in on the far side of inhabited space to harrass\
      \ and terrorize the inhabitants of several colonies both on their own planet\
      \ and its close neighbors, safe from retribution in their mountain bunker. The\
      \ local governments, being unable to handle the situation themselves, have pooled\
      \ what money they can spare and managed to hire a small band of mercenaries\
      \ to hopefully take care of the problem once and for all.</p>\n<p>With the help\
      \ of layout plans to the stronghold obtained from a spy who had managed to infiltrate\
      \ the gang a few months earlier, a plan has been devised to penetrate the enemy's\
      \ bunker and overload their power generator, destroying the entire complex.\
      \ The mercenary team has been airlifed into a small valley just over the hill\
      \ from the entrance to the enemy base, and must successfully breach the outer\
      \ defenses, reach the power core at the center of the base, and initiate the\
      \ overload sequence. Of course, should they fail, there is the likelihood that\
      \ the thugs will launch a severe retribution against the colonies which attacked\
      \ them, placing many innocent lives in jeopardy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There,\
      \ that ought to do for now. For our example map, we'll start with a simple plan\
      \ for a first objective:</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"\
      ><a href=\"/File:Legacy_astut-sketch.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy\
      \ astut-sketch.png\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_astut-sketch.png\" width=\"512\"\
      \ height=\"512\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>(The attackers will start around a\
      \ bend in the valley, and try to blow up the base door to get inside. We have\
      \ the option of a few different attack routes, places people can take cover,\
      \ etc.)</p>\n<p>So we'll sit down in the editor and put together a map based\
      \ on this plan. After a little bit of work, we might have something that looks\
      \ a little bit like this:</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"\
      ><a href=\"/File:Legacy_astut-valley.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy\
      \ astut-valley.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_astut-valley.jpeg\" width=\"700\"\
      \ height=\"371\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>For those who would like to follow\
      \ along (or are curious), all of the steps needed to create this map are detailed\
      \ in \"<a href=\"/Legacy:Assault_Mapping_Tutorial/Creating_Tutorial_Valley\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Assault Mapping Tutorial/Creating Tutorial Valley\">Legacy:Assault\
      \ Mapping Tutorial/Creating Tutorial Valley</a>\". Alternately, you can just\
      \ download the starting map (see the link on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Assault_Mapping_Tutorial\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Assault Mapping Tutorial\">Assault Mapping Tutorial</a> page)\
      \ and go from there.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"DefaultGameType\"\

      \ the <a href=\"/Legacy:Level_Properties\" title=\"Legacy:Level Properties\"\
      >Level Properties</a> and set the LevelInfo-&gt;DefaultGameType to \"UT2k4Assault.ASGameInfo\"\
      .</p>\n<p>(UnrealEd will usually also do this for you if you save your map with\
      \ an \"AS-\" prefix, but it doesn't hurt to double-check)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Proceed\

    text: "----\n\nThis page is a section of the [[Legacy:Assault Mapping Tutorial|Assault\
      \ Mapping Tutorial]].  If you have arrived here from some other place, this\
      \ page will likely make more sense if you start at the above link and read the\
      \ tutorial through from beginning to end.\n\n'''Previous Section: [[Legacy:Assault\
      \ Mapping Tutorial|Assault Mapping Tutorial]]'''\n\n'''Next Section: [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Creating\
      \ A Destroyable Objective]]'''\n\n----\n\n==Getting Started==\n\nAssault mapping\
      \ is easily the most complex and demanding of any of the game types to map for.\
      \  This is because it requires not only most of the skills needed to make all\
      \ of the other map types combined, but also throws in quite a few quirks of\
      \ its own.  Tempting though it may be, do not try to make an assault map for\
      \ your first ever mapping experience.  Instead, it is strongly recommended that\
      \ you have some experience mapping several other game types and have all the\
      \ basics down before you start considering an assault map.\n\nThat having been\
      \ said, while assault mapping is one of the most challenging forms of mapping\
      \ for UT2004, it can also be very rewarding.  There are a few things to keep\
      \ in mind when starting out, however:\n\n==Planning the Map==\n\nOk, so you're\
      \ starting a new map.  The first thing to do is fire up UnrealEd, right?  ''Wrong.''\
      \  You're not just making another Capture the Flag, or even Onslaught, map here.\
      \  This is Assault, and Assault takes planning.  If you want your map to be\
      \ any good at all you'll need to start thinking about a lot of details before\
      \ you sit down to start building.\n\nGet out a pencil and pad of paper (or a\
      \ text editor and a drawing program if you prefer).  You're going to need it.\n\
      \n===Backstory===\n\nFor a lot of folks, this seems like something that should\
      \ be an afterthought at most.  This is Unreal Tournament.  You go around and\
      \ shoot people.  Who cares about a story?  And this is pretty much true for\
      \ most of the other game types out there, but for assault, having an idea for\
      \ a bit of backstory and premise for your map before you begin is really one\
      \ of the first things you should do, and can be surprisingly important.\n\n\
      A backstory can provide several key factors for your map creation:\n\n* It can\
      \ give you a good key as to what the world should look and feel like, and more\
      \ importantly what the obstacles are and where you should be placing them. \
      \ What would attackers realistically need to do in this scenario?  How would\
      \ the defenders try to stop them?  Consistent goals that fit with a premise\
      \ can not only improve the believability for the players, but often help with\
      \ balance and timing issues later on.\n* As a corrolary to the previous point,\
      \ a backstory can give players a better intuitive feel for how the level works\
      \ and what they'll need to accomplish.  An assault level where the goals seem\
      \ to be completely arbitrary and confusingly placed can be very frustrating\
      \ to play.  On the other hand, if the player starts out with an idea of what\
      \ the map is all about, and where they need to go and what they need to do at\
      \ each stage flow naturally from that foundation, it can make playing less confusing\
      \ and more enjoyable for everyone involved.\n* A backstory that the player can\
      \ really get into can give a map a lot more depth and make it much more compelling\
      \ to play.  This is actually one of the big advantages to the Assault gametype.\
      \  The degree to which the gameplay is customized to each map can make each\
      \ one a lot more interesting than the \"same game with new scenery\" effect\
      \ one typically gets with new maps for most other gametypes.  Exploit this fact\
      \ and build from it to create a compelling world for your participants to be\
      \ part of and it will only enhance the game that much more.\n\nSo, that having\
      \ been said, here's a few questions you'll want to answer before you start:\n\
      * Who are these people?  Are the teams military troops on a campaign?  Bands\
      \ of citizens in a lawless world trying to survive?  Eco-terrorists fighting\
      \ to save a cute fuzzy animal?  There are more possibilities than you might\
      \ think at first glance.\n* How did they get here?  Is this the culmination\
      \ to a great crusade across half a planet?  Did the attackers just parachute\
      \ in from orbital drop-ships?  Did a covert op go bad and now one team is stuck\
      \ deep inside enemy territory?  \n* Why is the other team trying to stop them?\
      \  Defenders are people too, and they have their own stories.\n* What happens\
      \ when the attackers succeed with their mission?  What does this mean for the\
      \ larger universe?\n* What happens when the defenders succeed in stopping them?\n\
      \nThink about details.  Write it all down in a few paragraphs.  You'll be glad\
      \ you did later.  (Note that this shouldn't be set in stone, though.  You may\
      \ well need to go back and revisit this premise and tweak some things here and\
      \ there as you're building the map.  That's a natural part of the building process\
      \ too.)\n\n===Objectives===\n\nNow that you've got a good idea of what the story\
      \ behind your scenario is, it's time to start thinking in mapper terms.  Your\
      \ story should already have given you a few ideas about what obstacles and objectives\
      \ are going to be involved in the assault.  Now you need to think about how\
      \ you're going to implement them.\n\nTake a good read through the rest of this\
      \ tutorial with an eye to the types of objectives you have to work with.  For\
      \ your map you'll likely want somewhere between five and ten objectives from\
      \ beginning to end.  How many depends a lot on how the gameplay works out and\
      \ how long it takes people to get through them, so you may need to adjust things\
      \ as you go.  Pick four or five really important objectives that exemplify what\
      \ the story is all about, and then think about places you might add more or\
      \ ways you might substitute alternates if it looks like the gameplay needs it.\
      \  You want to get a starting plan, but don't get too tied down to anything\
      \ at this stage, because you never know what you might have to change later.\n\
      \nIt's very important here to think about the timing of your objectives.  To\
      \ maintain a consistent feel of progress and keep the game fun, you want the\
      \ objectives to be well spread out over the progress of the level, so there\
      \ aren't any places where people feel like they're whizzing through things or\
      \ bogged down in one place forever.  Also keep an eye on the total game time.\
      \  The default time in the game for one round of an Assault map is ten minutes,\
      \ and this is a good ballpark to shoot for.  Too much shorter than this and\
      \ people won't feel they've really accomplished anything.  Too much longer than\
      \ this, and people will start wondering if they'll ever see the end of things.\
      \  Got too many ideas for a ten-minute map?  That's ok, that just gives you\
      \ more to start with when you get to making your next map!  There's always a\
      \ next map, so don't blow all your good ideas at once.\n\nOk, got your basic\
      \ objectives?  Take a minute to think about the requirements that your objectives\
      \ will have in order to be challenging, but not impossible.  If you've got a\
      \ destroyable objective, for example, you don't want it in plain sight where\
      \ the attackers can just shoot it from their spawn points.  You need something\
      \ in the way that they'll have to navigate past to get to where they can attack\
      \ the target.  Have a HoldObjective?  You need to put it somewhere where the\
      \ defenders can try to blow away the person who's getting too close to it, but\
      \ at the same time you don't want it so defensible that the attackers never\
      \ get near it.  Take some ideas from other maps that work well, too.  Once you've\
      \ got some basic ideas for how you'll do all this, this should lead you right\
      \ into the next step...\n\n===Layout===\n\nNow it's time to start putting everything\
      \ together into an actual map.  From your backstory you've probably already\
      \ got an idea of what the scenery should look like.  From your objectives, you\
      \ have some idea of how the gameplay will need to progress, and what sort of\
      \ obstacles you'll want to have in the way.  Next you'll want to think about\
      \ travel.\n\nOne of the challenging aspects of Assault is that the attackers\
      \ need to manage to push their way through the defense to get at the objective,\
      \ and this usually means a lot of running, dodging, shooting, and so on (you\
      \ know, the fun stuff).  To do that we're going to need some distance between\
      \ the attackers' spawn point and the objective under attack.  For each stage,\
      \ you'll want some room to maneuver, and you might have a good number of people\
      \ on each team, so think fairly open spaces.  On the other hand, you'll want\
      \ to include some objects to duck behind, navigate around, jump from, and otherwise\
      \ make things interesting.  For at least some of your objectives, try to come\
      \ up with a couple of different routes to get to them.  This adds uncertainty\
      \ for both the attackers and defenders and can make the game more interesting.\
      \  Be careful with more than two routes, however, since if you're not careful\
      \ this can make things very frustrating for the defenders and very easy for\
      \ the attackers.  Also be really careful of \"sneaky\" routes.  Often they seem\
      \ like a neat way to add a clever twist to the attack, but a secret attack route\
      \ that none of the defenders know about can let the attackers just breeze through,\
      \ and that's no fun for the defense.\n\nYou'll also want to think about where\
      \ the spawn points for the attackers and defenders will be.  You want to make\
      \ sure there's a fair amount of room, because you might have a large number\
      \ of players on each team, but you also want to make them somewhat protected,\
      \ so one side can't just start shooting at the other as soon as they spawn (the\
      \ attackers need a chance to get near the objective, and the defenders need\
      \ time to get ready for them).  You'll also want to put the defender spawn point\
      \ a little bit out of the way of the battle, so that they aren't respawning\
      \ right on top of rocket blasts.\n\nFor each stage of the assault, draw out\
      \ a rough sketch of the layout of that area.  Plot out your anticipated attack\
      \ routes, and figure out where good places would be for the defenders to lie\
      \ in wait.  This will come in handy later when you get to bot pathing, and it\
      \ also gives you a chance to keep an eye on balance.\n\n===Balance===\n\nNow\
      \ if you've been thinking carefully about all of the bits up to this point,\
      \ you've probably already got this mostly covered, but this is still the time\
      \ to stop, step back from all your plans, and look at the whole map from the\
      \ perspective of the players on both sides.  Are all the objectives achievable\
      \ within the game's time limit?  Are they defendable for long enough to keep\
      \ the attackers at bay until the time runs out?  Are there any things you're\
      \ going to want to be careful of that might tip the balance one way or the other\
      \ while building the map?\n\nThere are always some little balance issues and\
      \ question marks at the end of planning.  Just keep them in mind as you actually\
      \ build the map, and with a little fiddling you can probably work them out as\
      \ you go.  You can't fix what you don't know is a problem, though, so try to\
      \ make sure you know where your gremlins are beforehand so you're ready for\
      \ them when you get to that part of the map.\n\n==Creating the Basic Map==\n\
      \nOk, now for the fun part.  We get to start building!  You've already got a\
      \ good idea for what you want your map to look like, and you're familiar with\
      \ all the basics from your previous experience building other maps, so I won't\
      \ bore you with a lot of details here.  For the purposes of our example, we'll\
      \ use a fairly simple scenario.  The first thing we'll need is a backstory,\
      \ perhaps something like:\n\n{{innerbox| Over a period of many years, a ruthless\
      \ band of criminal thugs have been building a stronghold in the mountains of\
      \ an otherwise peaceful farming planet towards the outer rim.  Recently, these\
      \ thugs have taken advantage of the military's preoccupation with an uprising\
      \ in on the far side of inhabited space to harrass and terrorize the inhabitants\
      \ of several colonies both on their own planet and its close neighbors, safe\
      \ from retribution in their mountain bunker.  The local governments, being unable\
      \ to handle the situation themselves, have pooled what money they can spare\
      \ and managed to hire a small band of mercenaries to hopefully take care of\
      \ the problem once and for all.\n\n With the help of layout plans to the stronghold\
      \ obtained from a spy who had managed to infiltrate the gang a few months earlier,\
      \ a plan has been devised to penetrate the enemy's bunker and overload their\
      \ power generator, destroying the entire complex.  The mercenary team has been\
      \ airlifed into a small valley just over the hill from the entrance to the enemy\
      \ base, and must successfully breach the outer defenses, reach the power core\
      \ at the center of the base, and initiate the overload sequence.  Of course,\
      \ should they fail, there is the likelihood that the thugs will launch a severe\
      \ retribution against the colonies which attacked them, placing many innocent\
      \ lives in jeopardy.\n\n}}\n\nThere, that ought to do for now.  For our example\
      \ map, we'll start with a simple plan for a first objective:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_astut-sketch.png|center|]]\n\
      \n(The attackers will start around a bend in the valley, and try to blow up\
      \ the base door to get inside.  We have the option of a few different attack\
      \ routes, places people can take cover, etc.)\n\nSo we'll sit down in the editor\
      \ and put together a map based on this plan.  After a little bit of work, we\
      \ might have something that looks a little bit like this:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_astut-valley.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nFor those who would like to follow along (or are curious), all of the steps\
      \ needed to create this map are detailed in \"[[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Creating\
      \ Tutorial Valley]]\".  Alternately, you can just download the starting map\
      \ (see the link on the [[Legacy:Assault Mapping Tutorial|Assault Mapping Tutorial]]\
      \ page) and go from there.\n\n==DefaultGameType==\n\nThe last thing we need\
      \ to do is tell the game that this is an Assault level, so it knows to load\
      \ the appropriate game rules.  This is not strictly necessary, as the game type\
      \ is usually specified explicitly in single-player mode by choosing it from\
      \ the menu, and in network mode by whoever sets up the server, but it's still\
      \ good practice to do it as there are a few situations where it can actually\
      \ be important.  To do this, go into the [[Legacy:Level Properties|Level Properties]]\
      \ and set the LevelInfo->DefaultGameType to \"UT2k4Assault.ASGameInfo\".\n\n\
      (UnrealEd will usually also do this for you if you save your map with an \"\
      AS-\" prefix, but it doesn't hurt to double-check)\n\n----\n\n'''Proceed to\
