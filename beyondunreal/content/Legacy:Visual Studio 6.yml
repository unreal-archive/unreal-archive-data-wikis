      \ to create your new Visual Studio Workspace, and add each package that corresponds\
      \ with a UT class. If you dont feel like doing this, you can nab mine when i\
      \ find a place to get it hosted (~293k).</p>\n<p>An ideal directory structure\
      \ would be like this: e:\\ut2003\\_vc &lt;– that is where your workspace will\
      \ go.</p>\n<p>If you dont see your workspace files, click on <b>View</b> then\
      \ <b>Workspace</b></p>\n<p>Just call the workspace _vc and save it in that folder.\
      \ Then you need to create a new package for each class. You will perform the\
      \ same process for adding a new mod into your workspace. This works very well\
      \ since you will be able to work with multiple mods without any of them getting\
      \ in the way of the other.</p>\n<p>Creating a new package or setting up the\
      \ base packages for UT2k3</p>\n<p>1. At this point you need to go the menu bar\
      \ in VS6 and click on <b>File</b> then on <b>New</b>.</p>\n<p>2. Click on the\
      \ tab called <b>Projects</b> and click on <b>Win32 Dynamic-Link Library</b>.</p>\n\
      <p>3. Make sure your location is pointing to the correct path. Example: <b>e:\\\
      ut2003\\_vc</b></p>\n<p>4. Add the name in <b>Project name</b>. In this case\
      \ we're going to use <b>Core</b>. You will see the location is now <b>e:\\ut2003\\\
      _vc\\Core</b></p>\n<p>5. Make sure it <b>Add to current Workspace</b> is selected,\
      \ and <b>Dependency of</b> is <b>NOT</b> checked.</p>\n<p>6. Click on <b>OK</b>.\
      \ At the next dialog, select <b>An Empty DLL project</b> and click <b>Finish</b>,\
      \ and then click <b>OK</b></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>At this point you have a nice\
      \ new shiny project, but it needs some editing...</p>\n<p>1. Expand the Boldfaced\
      \ Project name which in this case is <b>Core</b>.</p>\n<p>2. You will see 3\
      \ folders (if you dont, click on <b>FileView</b> on the bottom of that window).</p>\n\
      <p>3. Click on Source Files and hit the delete key. Do the same for <b>Header\
      \ Files</b>, and <b>Resource Files</b>.</p>\n<p>4. Right-Click on your boldfaced\
      \ project (which we are calling 'core' here) and click on <b>New Folder</b></p>\n\
      <p>5. The name of the new folder should be <b>Classes</b> and the file extension\
      \ is <b>.uc</b> and hit <b>OK</b></p>\n<p>6. Right-Click on the <b>Classes</b>\
      \ folder you just make and click on <b>Add files to folder</b></p>\n<p>7. In\
      \ the dialog box, go to your folder that has the .uc files in it. Which in this\
      \ case is <b>e:\\ut2003\\core\\classes</b></p>\n<p>8. You will have to change\
      \ the filemask to <b>*.*</b> below the filenames to see the .uc files. Select\
      \ the .uc (commandlet, locale, object, subsystem, time) files and click <b>OK</b></p>\n\
      <p><i><b>Make sure you are looking at the \\ut2003\\–MOD– folder and not \\\
      ut2003\\_vc\\–MOD– folder.. there are no files stored in the _vc folder only\
      \ references.</b></i></p>\n<p>At this point i'm going to assume you have all\
      \ of the packages done for each UT2k3 package and your mod as well.</p>\n<p>Make\
      \ sure your project is boldfaced. You can do this by right-clicking on your\
      \ package and selecting <b>Set as Active Project</b>. Why? Ill explain in a\
      \ bit.</p>\n<p><b>MAKE SURE YOU SAVE EVERYTHING AT THIS POINT!!! USE THE TRIPLE\
      \ DISK LOOKING ICON TO SAVE ALL OR USE THE MENU PULLDOWN</b></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If\
      \ you have a custom mod, make sure you have it in your {<a href=\"/Legacy:BaseDirectory\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:BaseDirectory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">BaseDirectory</a>}/System/UT2003.ini\
      \ file in the <b>EditPackages</b> section at the end of the list. Example: <b>EditPackages=MYMOD</b></p>\n\
      <p>If you dont do that step, you can compile until your drive falls out, and\
      \ it will not compile your mod. There are exceptions using custom .ini files,\
      \ but that is too indepth for this page.</p>\n<p>Now you should have all of\
      \ the packages on the left side visible. If you expand the package, and expand\
      \ the classes, you should see all of the files for each one. You can double\
      \ click on any of the .uc files and it will show in the editor.</p>\n<p>Now\
      \ to build your package, you can go to <b>Tools</b> Then select <b>UCC Release\
      \ Builder</b>. and it will delete the old .u file that has the same name as\
      \ the project you have boldfaced on the left sidebar. It will then compile the\
      \ packages and place the output in your {<a href=\"/Legacy:BaseDirectory\" title=\"\
      Legacy:BaseDirectory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">BaseDirectory</a>}/System folder.</p>\n\

      <li>If you need to find a class or word, use the menu bar <b>Edit</b> and <b>Find\

      <li>Multiple packages in 1 editor. Just set another package as the <b>Active</b>\

  wikitext:
    text: "'''Visual Studio 6 (VS6)''' and '''Visual Studio .NET (VS.NET)''' are [[Legacy:IDE|IDE]]s\
      \ that can be set up for use as [[Legacy:UnrealScript|UnrealScript]] editors.\
      \ They work great and have some good features, plus if you already use VS, you\
      \ will feel right at home.\n\nIf someone has a place I can put some graphic\
      \ files and 1 starter file, I'll update this to make it much easier... If you\
      \ want the starter file, and you see me [[Legacy:OBWANDO|OBWANDO]] on IRC or\
      \ somewhere , just ask... ill send it to you until I find a way to get it up\
      \ here...\n\n==Getting the Unreal Script source readily available==\n\nFirst\
      \ of all, make sure you've exported all the .uc's from the game's packages.\
      \ You can go get the source or learn how to extract them from here: [[Legacy:UnrealScript\
      \ Source|UnrealScript Source]]\n\n==Setting up Visual Studio 6==\n\nNext go\
      \ to the UDN page here: [[udn2:UnrealScriptHighlighting]] and follow the directions\
      \ for getting the syntax highlighter to work in VS6. This will let you see the\
      \ uscript words in a different color and makes reading code easier.\n\n===Using\
      \ a batch file for compilation===\n\nYou will need to create a batch file to\
      \ help automate things. So... Crank up your notepad\n\nThe batch file should\
      \ have the following in it:\n\n<uscript>\n@ECHO OFF\ndel %1.u\nucc make\n</uscript>\n\
      \nAnd save it as: '''MakePackage.bat''' and save it in your {[[Legacy:Base Directory|Base\
      \ Directory]]}\\System folder. (Make sure you didn't accidentally save it as\
      \ MakePackage.bat'''.txt'''.)\n\n# Select ''Tools'' -> ''Customize'' from the\
      \ menu bar.\n\n# Click on the ''Tools'' Tab and select the small graphic that\
      \ looks like a square with a yellow star in the corner. It will take you to\
      \ the bottom of the list.\n\n# In the empty field enter <code>&UCC Release Builder</code>.\
      \ If you want, you can use the arrows above to move it up in the list if you\
      \ want.\n\n# In the ''Command'' field you put the following command (change\
      \ the path to reflect [[Legacy:Base Directory|Base Directory]]): <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\\\
      UT2003\\system\\MakePackage.bat</tt>\n\n# In the ''Arguments'' field, enter:\
      \ <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;$(WkspName)</tt>\n\n# In the ''Initial Directory'' field\
      \ enter your {[[Legacy:Base Directory|Base Directory]]}\\System directory, for\
      \ example: <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\\UT2003\\system</tt>\n\n# Make sure ''Use\
      \ Output Window'' is checked. and click on ''Close''.\n\n===Using UMake for\
      \ compilation===\n\n[[Legacy:UMake|UMake]] is a graphical front-end for the\
      \ UnrealScript compiler.\n\n# Download and install [[Legacy:UMake|UMake]].\n\
      # Proceed as described in the previous section, but:\n# * Enter your path to\
      \ UMake.exe in the ''Command'' field (pointing to wherever you installed UMake\
      \ in), for example: <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\\UT2003\\System\\UMake.exe</tt>\n\
      # * In the ''Arguments'' field, enter: <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;$(FileName)</tt>\n\
      \n===Creating the packages and workspace===\n\nOnce you have all of that together,\
      \ you will need to create your new Visual Studio Workspace, and add each package\
      \ that corresponds with a UT class. If you dont feel like doing this, you can\
      \ nab mine when i find a place to get it hosted (~293k).\n\nAn ideal directory\
      \ structure would be like this: e:\\ut2003\\_vc  <&ndash; that is where your\
      \ workspace will go.\n\nIf you dont see your workspace files, click on '''View'''\
      \ then '''Workspace'''\n\nJust call the workspace _vc and save it in that folder.\
      \ Then you need to create a new package for each class. You will perform the\
      \ same process for adding a new mod into your workspace. This works very well\
      \ since you will be able to work with multiple mods without any of them getting\
      \ in the way of the other.\n\nCreating a new package or setting up the base\
      \ packages for UT2k3\n\n1. At this point you need to go the menu bar in VS6\
      \ and click on '''File''' then on '''New'''.\n\n2. Click on the tab called '''Projects'''\
      \ and click on '''Win32 Dynamic-Link Library'''.\n\n3. Make sure your location\
      \ is pointing to the correct path. Example: '''e:\\ut2003\\_vc'''\n\n4. Add\
      \ the name in '''Project name'''. In this case we're going to use '''Core'''.\
      \ You will see the location is now '''e:\\ut2003\\_vc\\Core'''\n\n5. Make sure\
      \ it '''Add to current Workspace''' is selected, and '''Dependency of''' is\
      \ '''NOT''' checked.\n\n6. Click on '''OK'''. At the next dialog, select '''An\
      \ Empty DLL project''' and click '''Finish''', and then click '''OK'''\n\n<BR>\n\
      \nAt this point you have a nice new shiny project, but it needs some editing...\n\
      \n1. Expand the Boldfaced Project name which in this case is '''Core'''.\n\n\
      2. You will see 3 folders (if you dont, click on '''FileView''' on the bottom\
      \ of that window).\n\n3. Click on Source Files and hit the delete key. Do the\
      \ same for '''Header Files''', and '''Resource Files'''.\n\n4. Right-Click on\
      \ your boldfaced project (which we are calling 'core' here) and click on '''New\
      \ Folder'''\n\n5. The name of the new folder should be '''Classes''' and the\
      \ file extension is '''.uc''' and hit '''OK'''\n\n6. Right-Click on the '''Classes'''\
      \ folder you just make and click on '''Add files to folder'''\n\n7. In the dialog\
      \ box, go to your folder that has the .uc files in it. Which in this case is\
      \ '''e:\\ut2003\\core\\classes'''\n\n8. You will have to change the filemask\
      \ to '''*.*''' below the filenames to see the .uc files. Select the .uc (commandlet,\
      \ locale, object, subsystem, time) files and click '''OK'''\n\n''''' Make sure\
      \ you are looking at the \\ut2003\\&ndash;MOD&ndash; folder and not \\ut2003\\\
      _vc\\&ndash;MOD&ndash; folder.. there are no files stored in the _vc folder\
      \ only references. '''''\n\nAt this point i'm going to assume you have all of\
      \ the packages done for each UT2k3 package and your mod as well.\n\nMake sure\
      \ your project is boldfaced. You can do this by right-clicking on your package\
      \ and selecting '''Set as Active Project'''. Why? Ill explain in a bit.\n\n\
      '''MAKE SURE YOU SAVE EVERYTHING AT THIS POINT!!! USE THE TRIPLE DISK LOOKING\
      \ ICON TO SAVE ALL OR USE THE MENU PULLDOWN'''\n\n----\n\nIf you have a custom\
      \ mod, make sure you have it in your {[[Legacy:BaseDirectory|BaseDirectory]]}/System/UT2003.ini\
      \ file in the '''EditPackages''' section at the end of the list. Example: '''EditPackages=MYMOD'''\n\
      \nIf you dont do that step, you can compile until your drive falls out, and\
      \ it will not compile your mod. There are exceptions using custom .ini files,\
      \ but that is too indepth for this page.\n\nNow you should have all of the packages\
      \ on the left side visible. If you expand the package, and expand the classes,\
      \ you should see all of the files for each one. You can double click on any\
      \ of the .uc files and it will show in the editor.\n\nNow to build your package,\
      \ you can go to '''Tools''' Then select '''UCC Release Builder'''. and it will\
      \ delete the old .u file that has the same name as the project you have boldfaced\
      \ on the left sidebar. It will then compile the packages and place the output\
      \ in your {[[Legacy:BaseDirectory|BaseDirectory]]}/System folder.\n\n==Why VS6?\
      \ ==\n* Well if you get an error, you can double click on that line, and it\
      \ will go to that file, open it and jump to that line...\n* If you need to find\
      \ a class or word, use the menu bar '''Edit''' and '''Find in files''' and put\
      \ your word in, make sure the path points to your /ut2003 folder, and the '''In\
      \ Files/File Types''' is set to '''*.uc''' It will show every instance of that\
      \ word in every file will be shown to you. Just double click on that line and\
      \ it will open the file and jump to that line. This is great for researching\
      \ code and finding usable areas on how other coders and Epic did a lot of their\
      \ routines, as well as finding some of your own.\n* Multiple packages in 1 editor.\
      \ Just set another package as the '''Active''' package and you can keep working\
      \ without fumbling around in directories.\n* Add macros to use CVS or use Sourcesafe\
      \ natively, or add extra icons and macros to start up dedicated servers, build\
      \ debug versions, or whatever.\n\nI hope this helps everyone, and there is no\
      \ '''Right''' or '''Wrong''' editor to use, just the one you are most comfortable\
      \ with. I use VS6 all of time since I do C/C++/ASM work (yes i use nasm as well)\
      \ and I am comfortable with the environment. This can be adopted for Visual\
      \ Studio .Net as well, and you can find more info on that on the UDN, but the\
      \ method is still pretty much the same.\n\nGood luck and happy Coding!\n\n==Related\
      \ Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Setting Up UnrealScript|Setting Up UnrealScript]]\n\n\
      ==Comments==\n\n'''GRAF1K:''' Visual Studio .NET is even more useful. Perhaps\
      \ a new section or page on that would be useful.\n\n==Setting Up Visual Studio\
      \ .NET==\n\nGo to the UDN page here: [[udn2:UnrealScriptHighlighting]] and follow\
      \ the directions for getting the syntax highlighter to work in VS .NET. This\
      \ will let you see the uscript words in a different color and makes reading\
      \ code easier.\n\n===Using a batch file for compilation===\n\nYou will need\

      \nThe batch file should have the following in it:\n\n<uscript>\n@ECHO OFF\n\
      del %1.u\nucc make\n</uscript>\n\nAnd save it as: '''MakePackage.bat''' and\
      \ save it in your {[[Legacy:Base Directory|Base Directory]]}\\System folder.\
      \ (Make sure you didn't accidentally save it as MakePackage.bat'''.txt'''.)\n\
      \n# Select ''Tools'' -> ''External Tools'' from the menu bar.\n\n# Click the\
      \ ''Add'' button. A new entry with the name <code>[New Tool 1]</code> will be\
      \ added at the bottom of the list.\n\n# In the ''Title'' field enter <code>&UCC\
      \ Release Builder</code>. The entry in the list will adjust accordingly.\n\n\
      # In the ''Command'' field you put the following command (change the path to\
      \ reflect [[Legacy:Base Directory|Base Directory]]): <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\\\
      UT2003\\system\\MakePackage.bat</tt>\n\n# In the ''Arguments'' field, enter:\
      \ <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;$(SolutionFileName)</tt>\n\n# In the ''Initial Directory''\
      \ field enter your {[[Legacy:Base Directory|Base Directory]]}\\System directory,\
      \ for example: <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\\UT2003\\system</tt>\n\n# Make sure\
      \ ''Use Output Window'' is checked, and click on ''OK''.\n\n===Using UMake for\
      \ compilation===\n\n# Download and install [[Legacy:UMake|UMake]].\n# Proceed\
      \ as described in the previous section, but:\n# * Enter your path to UMake.exe\

      You can have the ''Edit'' button in UMake open erroneos files in the studio,\
      \ but it will do so in a new window every time. If you want to be able to use\
      \ it anyway, start UMake, click ''Options'', make sure the ''General'' tab is\
      \ selected and copy/paste the following into the ''Source code editor'' field:\n\
      \n<tt>\"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exe\"\

      \ Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET </tt> to the directory where you installed\
      \ your Visual Studio.\n\n==Comments==\n\n'''DarthDevilous''': This is just the\
      \ start, and I hope someone else will continue. Since I have not got some great\
      \ scripting project waiting I cannot really test the rest to see whether it\
      \ works. On another note, I can't get the script highlighting for VS.NET to\
      \ work properly. The only difference I can see is that '''super''' is highlighted\
      \ and that may be because I have never used it as a keyword before.\n\n'''Phoenix''':\
      \ You can get VS.NET to work properly easily&ndash;it's not very well documented\
      \ on the website you've mentioned:\n#Fire up regedit, and go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\
      Software\\VisualStudio\\[YourVersion]\\Languages\\File Extensions, add .uc if\
      \ it's not there.\n#Change the (Default) value to {B2F072B0-ABC1-11D0-9D62-00C04FD9DFD9}\n\
      #Download the usertype.dat from the site above ([[udn2:UnrealScriptHighlighting]])\
      \ and save it to [VisualStudio]\\Common7\\IDE\n#You can also edit usertype.dat\
      \ to add/remove any keywords.\n#Restart Visual Studio\n\nThis has been tested\
      \ & confirmed working on Visual Studio 2005.\n\n'''Daktor''': I cannot find\
      \ the download for usertype.dat, can someone upload it or show where it is on\
