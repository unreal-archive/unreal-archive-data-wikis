      <p>I'm a lazy bastard and don't update my journal as often as I should.</p>\n\
      <p>I did run into a few problems with <a href=\"/Legacy:Postal_2\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Postal 2\">Postal 2</a>. Apparently Postal 2's version of <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:ScriptedTexture\" title=\"Legacy:ScriptedTexture\">ScriptedTexture</a>\
      \ doesn't allow for the DrawPortal function. This pretty much shot down my plans\
      \ for jail cameras for P2JailBreak. Instead I had to use something similar to\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Mychaeel\" title=\"Legacy:Mychaeel\">Mychaeel</a>'s <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:CameraSpot\" title=\"Legacy:CameraSpot\">CameraSpot</a>. I created a\
      \ new class called <a href=\"/Legacy:ChangeViewTrigger\" title=\"Legacy:ChangeViewTrigger\"\
      >ChangeViewTrigger</a> which can be linked to a volume or other trigger to change\
      \ the player's viewpoint to another camera, player, etc.</p>\n<p>I do have most\
      \ of the glitches worked out for P2JailBreak. The only real major problem left\
      \ is that players who kill MadCow-infected players don't receive the bonuses\
      \ they're supposed to. MadCow Disease is the P2JailBreak version of the Llama\
      \ Hunt, intended to punish players who reconnect to escape jail.</p>\n<p>Ponderous-JB\
      \ how has 6 of the <a href=\"/Legacy:ChangeViewTrigger\" title=\"Legacy:ChangeViewTrigger\"\
      >ChangeViewTriggers</a>, 3 for each jail. One of them is linked up to the big-screen\
      \ TV in the bedroom-turned-jail, which shows an outside view of the base you're\
      \ locked up in. The other two show you a view of the current leader or one of\
      \ your non-jailed teammates.</p>\n<p>I have some major wiki work to do on the\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Postal_2\" title=\"Legacy:Postal 2\">Postal 2</a> classes...</p>\n\

      <p>P2JailBreak is going smoothly. It's not as sophisticated as the newer UT2K3/2K4\
      \ versions of <a href=\"/Legacy:Jailbreak\" title=\"Legacy:Jailbreak\">Jailbreak</a>\
      \ but it'll suffice for the Postal community.</p>\n<p>I made Jailbreak maps\
      \ out of Ponderous, Intifada, and Ghetto Sewer. Ponderous and Intifada are <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:SNATCH\" title=\"Legacy:SNATCH\">SNATCH</a> maps that come\
      \ with Postal 2 and Ghetto Sewer is a custom <a href=\"/Legacy:SNATCH\" title=\"\
      Legacy:SNATCH\">SNATCH</a> map.</p>\n<p>Renegade didn't do a very good job with\
      \ Ghetto Sewer. On the outside the map rocks, but there are a lot of technical\
      \ issues, such as zone leakage... and don't forget the fact that there isn't\
      \ a single <a href=\"/Legacy:PathNode\" title=\"Legacy:PathNode\">PathNode</a>\

      <p>I made a post on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"\
      http://web2.gopostal.com/cgi-bin/ib3/ikonboard.cgi\">RWS Message Board</a> inquiring\
      \ about what mod I should make next for Postal 2. I have a few changes to make\
      \ to <a href=\"/Legacy:Postal_2/PostalArena\" title=\"Legacy:Postal 2/PostalArena\"\
      >Postal 2/PostalArena</a> before I release version 1.2, hopefully the last version\
      \ I'll need to make.</p>\n<p>I narrowed it down to the following.</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li><b>JailBreak</b>. I had a look at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
      \ text\" href=\"http://www.planetjailbreak.com\">JailBreak web site</a> and\
      \ I think this would go over quite well for Postal 2. It should be fairly easy\
      \ to code, but I'll probably dispense with all the extras that the UT version\
      \ of JailBreak has, with the exception of Llama Hunting, because we all hate\
      \ cheaters. (<a href=\"/Legacy:Jailbreak\" title=\"Legacy:Jailbreak\">Jailbreak</a>)</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Expert Snatch</b>. This would be more suitable as a Snatch\
      \ mutator that simply starts players off with the complete arsenal of weapons,\
      \ 125 health, and a few goodies such as a crack pipe. I don't want to add a\
      \ grappling hook because of the nature of some of the snatch levels. (<a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Mod_Ideas/ExpertCTF\" title=\"Legacy:Mod Ideas/ExpertCTF\">Mod_Ideas/ExpertCTF</a>)</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>TurnCoat</b>. This would work better as a timed <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Postal_2/AirMail\" title=\"Legacy:Postal 2/AirMail\">Postal 2/AirMail</a>\
      \ powerup that, when activated, would disguise the user as a member of the enemy\
      \ team. (<a href=\"/Legacy:Mod_Ideas/TurnCoat\" title=\"Legacy:Mod Ideas/TurnCoat\"\

      \nI have some major wiki work to do on the [[Legacy:Postal 2|Postal 2]] classes...\n\
      \n==June 6, 2004 ==\n\nP2JailBreak is going smoothly. It's not as sophisticated\
      \ as the newer UT2K3/2K4 versions of [[Legacy:Jailbreak|Jailbreak]] but it'll\
      \ suffice for the Postal community.\n\nI made Jailbreak maps out of Ponderous,\
      \ Intifada, and Ghetto Sewer. Ponderous and Intifada are [[Legacy:SNATCH|SNATCH]]\
      \ maps that come with Postal 2 and Ghetto Sewer is a custom [[Legacy:SNATCH|SNATCH]]\
      \ map.\n\nRenegade didn't do a very good job with Ghetto Sewer. On the outside\
      \ the map rocks, but there are a lot of technical issues, such as zone leakage...\
      \ and don't forget the fact that there isn't a single [[Legacy:PathNode|PathNode]]\
      \ in the entire map...\n\n==June 5, 2004 ==\n\nBegun work on the [[Legacy:Postal\
      \ 2|Postal 2]] version of [[Legacy:Jailbreak|Jailbreak]]. Please don't sue me\
      \ [[Legacy:Mychaeel|Mychaeel]] :O\n\n==June 1, 2004 ==\n\nI made a post on the\
      \ [http://web2.gopostal.com/cgi-bin/ib3/ikonboard.cgi RWS Message Board] inquiring\
      \ about what mod I should make next for Postal 2. I have a few changes to make\
      \ to [[Legacy:Postal 2/PostalArena|Postal 2/PostalArena]] before I release version\
      \ 1.2, hopefully the last version I'll need to make.\n\nI narrowed it down to\
      \ the following.\n\n* <b>JailBreak</b>. I had a look at the [http://www.planetjailbreak.com\
      \ JailBreak web site] and I think this would go over quite well for Postal 2.\
      \ It should be fairly easy to code, but I'll probably dispense with all the\
      \ extras that the UT version of JailBreak has, with the exception of Llama Hunting,\
      \ because we all hate cheaters. ([[Legacy:Jailbreak|Jailbreak]])\n\n* <b>Expert\
      \ Snatch</b>. This would be more suitable as a Snatch mutator that simply starts\
      \ players off with the complete arsenal of weapons, 125 health, and a few goodies\
      \ such as a crack pipe. I don't want to add a grappling hook because of the\
      \ nature of some of the snatch levels. ([[Legacy:Mod_Ideas/ExpertCTF|Mod_Ideas/ExpertCTF]])\n\
      \n* <b>TurnCoat</b>. This would work better as a timed [[Legacy:Postal 2/AirMail|Postal\
      \ 2/AirMail]] powerup that, when activated, would disguise the user as a member\
      \ of the enemy team. ([[Legacy:Mod_Ideas/TurnCoat|Mod_Ideas/TurnCoat]])\n\n\
