    text: "<p>The <b>Unreal Editor</b>, <b>UnrealEd</b> or <b>UEd</b> for short, is\
      \ the game content editor for <a href=\"/Unreal\" title=\"Unreal\">Unreal</a>,\
      \ which is where the name comes from, and most other <a href=\"/Unreal_Engine\"\
      \ title=\"Unreal Engine\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Unreal Engine</a> games. Each\
      \ Unreal Engine game has its own version of the editor, which is usually named\
      \ after the game it comes with, for example XIIIEd for the game <a href=\"/XIII\"\
      \ title=\"XIII\">XIII</a> or Unreal Tournament 3 Editor for <a href=\"/UT3\"\
      \ title=\"UT3\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UT3</a>.</p>\n<p>Due to its deep integration\
      \ into the engine, the editor applications of different games (or sometimes\
      \ even different versions of the same game) are usually not compatible to each\
      \ other. That means if a certain game does not come with the editor, it is very\
      \ unlikely that another game's editor could be used instead. Also, the various\
      \ developers may have made customizations to their specific versions of the\
      \ editor.</p>\n<p>One common \"feature\" of all UnrealEd incarnations is their\
      \ lack of stability. While the editor has become more stable over time and has\
      \ an auto-save feature for maps, you should always work under the motto \"<i>save\
      \ early, save often!</i>\" As a rule of thumb you should save your maps and\
      \ custom resource packages right before and after every big operation.</p>\n\

      <p>The main feature of all UnrealEd versions is, of course, the map editor.\

      \ in UnrealEd 1 and 2. The Unreal Engine 3 editors no longer provide means to\
      \ edit and compile UnrealScript classes but have a combined generic browser\
      \ and some very elaborate editors for materials, particle effects and many other\
      \ features.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.018 seconds\n\
