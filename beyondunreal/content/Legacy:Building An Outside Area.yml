      \ subtracted space should be a fair distance beyond whatever constrains the\
      \ players to the play area. This is to prevent players from shooting the \"\

      \ motion - this is, of course, just an illusion. The illusion is based on having\
      \ things move rapidly past the level, typically in the skybox. Usually a zone\
      \ or volume is set up so the player will die if they leave whatever it is that\

      \ a TexPanner to use on the surfaces. This is recommended only for the most\
      \ \"background\" layer of the effect, though it is often sufficient. If you\
      \ want your \"mobile\" level to have lots of eyecandy, attaching actors to unseen\
      \ movers can make the level appear to \"pass\" other stationary objects such\
      \ as signs/animals/asteroids/people/rocks/etc.</p>\n<p>This effect is used primarily\
      \ outdoors, but can be used outside a window on an indoor level if the level's\

      \ for a 'motion' effect also?</p>\n<p><b>VICIOUS713:</b> Is there a way to have\

      \ It can be done. Hourences implemented this in DM-Redkin. Perhaps he could\

      \ work? You could attach the ship(s) to movers and have them go around the skybox\
