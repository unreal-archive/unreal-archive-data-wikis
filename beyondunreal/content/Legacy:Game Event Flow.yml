      \ title=\"Edit section: About this page\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This is going to be the home page for documentation\
      \ on how the UnrealScript classes get called in the VM from the native engine\
      \ code. It will probably always be incomplete. But it should provide a good\
      \ starting point for those who are trying to learn \"what gets called when\"\
      .</p>\n<p>There are three objectives here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define important game\
      \ events</li>\n<li>Document UScript class entry points</li>\n<li>Create flowcharts\
      \ for important game event cycles</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First, we'll try to define\
      \ the set of \"important\" game events, such as game start, map change, player\
      \ spawn, etc. These are not necessarily \"events\" in the UScript sense, but\
      \ they are often related. These would simply be definitions of terms for reference\
      \ in the other areas here.</p>\n<p>Second, each of the methods in any classes\
      \ (or derived classes) that are called directly by the engine would be documented\
      \ on a per-class basis. This is a reference-style section, so you can look at\
      \ a class and see what types of game events cause method calls for this class.</p>\n\
      <p>Note: Events should be documented in the \"least derived class\" for which\
      \ they are relevant. Thus, events that are really designed for the UnrealPawn\
      \ class should be documented there, not in Actor, nor in xPawn. This is a judgment\
      \ call, but we should try to keep it as clear and intuitive as possible.</p>\n\
      <p>Third, something that I think would help tremendously in the learning process\
      \ would be graphical flowcharts that show \"game cycles\" and how they work.\
      \ So, for example, what happens when a player joins a game, or a projectile\
      \ is fired? There are a number of key methods (listed in the above section)\
      \ that are called, in a very specific order.</p>\n<p>We don't need to get down\
      \ to the microscopic source-level, as that would be redundant with reading the\
      \ sources. But a high-level view of important processes in the game will be\
      \ very useful.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Status\">Status</span><span\
