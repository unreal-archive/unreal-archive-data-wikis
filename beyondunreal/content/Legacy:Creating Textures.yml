      \ sort to seperate your tex (i.e. Zxan_GrandCanyon)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Tiling&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>When creating a texture for a wall, floor, or any other large object, it\
      \ is necessary to realize one thing, it needs to be tileable (all of it's edges\
      \ need to be able to touch it's opposite edge and blend nicely). If a texture\
      \ isn't tileable it will look awful in game leaving scar marks where the edges\
      \ don't blend. There are a few ways of doing this. One way of doing this is\
      \ to copy a selection of one edge and paste it onto the other and mirror it\
      \ before releasing its selection. This way works but quite often results in\
      \ odd effects so isn't the recommended way of going about things. My recommendation\
      \ is that if you are using Photoshop or PSP to download the Simple Filters at\
      \ <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.btinternet.com/~cateran/simple/\"\
      >http://www.btinternet.com/~cateran/simple/</a> and use either the quick tile\
      \ or the halfwrap to do this. The half wrap works wonderfully since it takes\
      \ all of the edges and folds them inward (showing you how they will connect)\
      \ after using it patch up where they touch and save the texture (be sure that\
      \ it has been reduced in color before saving). I also recommend saving a 16\
      \ mil color copy of your texture as well, in case any editing needs to be done\
      \ or if it is a base texture that will be used for the creation of dozens of\
      \ other textures.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Related_Topics\"\
