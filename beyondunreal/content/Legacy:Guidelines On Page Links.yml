      \ opposite of not linking at all. It's most convenient for authors and readers\
      \ alike to link only the first occurrence of a term in a logical unit (a section\
      \ of a tutorial, for instance). Since links stand out visually, they have the\
      \ potential to disrupt the reader's flow and make reading a long text a pain\
      \ when each and every sentence has one or more links. For example, if you mention\
      \ \"PlayerStart\" several times, link only the first one, or the one that's\
      \ relating to something technical, at a point where the reader might logically\
      \ want to read up on the specifics.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Connect related\
      \ pages.</b> Click on the page title to do a search on the page name. If you\
      \ find pages which you think are related, create a link both ways.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <ul>\n<li><b>Link terms in their singular form</b> and not their plural form;\
      \ for instance, link <code><a href=\"/Legacy:Zone\" title=\"Legacy:Zone\">zones</a></code>,\
      \ not <code><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Zones?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Zones (page does not exist)\">zones</a></code> (and not <code><a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Zone\" title=\"Legacy:Zone\">zones</a></code> either). That will make\
      \ it easier to link to that article in a sentence like \"create another <code><a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Zone\" title=\"Legacy:Zone\">zone</a></code>.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>On the other hand, <b>link duplication is good.</b> It's easy for\
      \ n00bs to land on technical pages. Give them a link to something simple, like\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Types_Of_Trigger\" title=\"Legacy:Types Of Trigger\">Types\
      \ of Trigger</a> on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Triggers_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Triggers\
      \ (UT)\">Triggers (UT)</a> class spec. The hierarchy is quite vague – one page\
      \ may get a link on several topic pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Avoid abbreviations.</b>\
      \ Their meaning may be clear to you, but abbreviations have the inherent risk\
      \ of being ambiguous and confusing not only to newbies. <i>Very</i> common acronyms\
      \ like <a href=\"/Legacy:HUD_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:HUD (UT)\">HUD (UT)</a> and\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP\" title=\"Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a> have their own pages\
      \ – link to them. If you use an abbreviation, give the full term in parenthesis\
      \ the first time you use it on a page, like \"OCD (Object Collision Detection)\"\
      \ or vice-versa, \"Object Collision Detection (OCD).\"</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>No\
      \ \"here\" links.</b> Linking along the lines of \"Click <a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Personal_Page\"\
      \ title=\"Category:Legacy Personal Page\">here</a> to get a list of contributors\"\
      \ is <i>very</i> bad style and detrimental to readability. If you by any means\
      \ can, link the actual page titles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      <p>Links to category pages are usually put at the foot of a page, beneath a\
      \ rule-off ('----' in markup). However, category pages that count as a related\
      \ topic, eg \"Category Mapping\" can go in the Related Topics section.</p>\n\
      <p><b>T1:</b> So does this mean we should always put the link in both places,\
      \ or choose based on the situation? I vote for the \"both places\" choice if\
      \ it's up for vote.</p>\n<p><b>OlympusMons:</b> I thought the <i>Topics on whatever</i>\
      \ would go in the <i>related topics</i> where the <i>catergories</i> would go\
      \ in the well <i>catergory links</i> unless the <i>catergories</i> is moved\
      \ above the <i>related topics</i>. Preferrably Id like to see <i>related topics</i>\
      \ at the tops of the page with the <i>catergories</i> on the bottom but this\
      \ isnt a huge issue. I think actually getting the main pages for everything\
      \ to some sort of complete status would be then we can discuss formatting once\
      \ ut2k7 is alittle closer. Also I have seen pages with links up the top, they\
      \ are under <i>required reading</i>.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I'd say if the\
      \ category link is in the related topics, only 1 copy is needed. But having\
      \ 2 won't do any harm&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> I agree that it can be\
      \ considered a Related Topic, but if all the other pages are formatted one way\
      \ and we begin to subjectively change <i>some</i> of them, what's the point?\
      \ And where would the line be drawn? To me, they seem to be nearly in the same\
      \ location on the page; near the bottom along with External Links, etc. They\
      \ also seem to be a separate kind of page, one that uses the MAGIC keyword to\
      \ group all pages, but itself is not a page containing topic info. You're right,\
      \ there's no <i>harm</i> done either way, but if we're going to have a standard\
      \ or method to this madness, I vote that it stay consistent. (at the bottom,\
      \ under a rule-off and grouped with other category and wiki tags.) /my $0.02\

      \ (see below). Give the reader some places to go to.\n* '''Topic pages''' such\
      \ as [[Legacy:Mover Topics|Mover Topics]] or [[Legacy:Lighting|Lighting]].\n\
      * '''Menu names''' give full menu commands and link the menu name, like this:\
      \ \"[[Legacy:UnrealEd Main Menu|UnrealEd Main Menu]] -> File -> New\". See [[Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Menus|UnrealEd Menus]] for the list of page names.\n\n===General guidelines\
      \ on links ===\n\n* '''Don't overdo linking.'''  That's the extreme opposite\
      \ of not linking at all.  It's most convenient for authors and readers alike\
      \ to link only the first occurrence of a term in a logical unit (a section of\
      \ a tutorial, for instance).  Since links stand out visually, they have the\
      \ potential to disrupt the reader's flow and make reading a long text a pain\
      \ when each and every sentence has one or more links. For example, if you mention\
      \ \"PlayerStart\" several times, link only the first one, or the one that's\
      \ relating to something technical, at a point where the reader might logically\
      \ want to read up on the specifics. \n\n* '''Connect related pages.''' Click\
      \ on the page title to do a search on the page name. If you find pages which\
      \ you think are related, create a link both ways.\n\n* '''Link terms in their\
      \ singular form''' and not their plural form; for instance, link <code>[[Legacy:Zone|zone]]s</code>,\
      \ not <code>[[Legacy:Zones|zones]]</code> (and not <code>[[Legacy:Zone|zones]]</code>\
      \ either).  That will make it easier to link to that article in a sentence like\
      \ \"create another <code>[[Legacy:Zone|zone]]</code>.\"\n\n* On the other hand,\
      \ '''link duplication is good.''' It's easy for n00bs to land on technical pages.\
      \ Give them a link to something simple, like [[Legacy:Types Of Trigger|Types\
      \ of Trigger]] on the [[Legacy:Triggers (UT)|Triggers (UT)]] class spec. The\
      \ hierarchy is quite vague &ndash; one page may get a link on several topic\
      \ pages.\n\n* '''Avoid abbreviations.'''  Their meaning may be clear to you,\
      \ but abbreviations have the inherent risk of being ambiguous and confusing\
      \ not only to newbies.  ''Very'' common acronyms like [[Legacy:HUD (UT)|HUD\
      \ (UT)]] and [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]] have their own pages &ndash; link to them. \
      \ If you use an abbreviation, give the full term in parenthesis the first time\
      \ you use it on a page, like \"OCD (Object Collision Detection)\" or vice-versa,\
      \ \"Object Collision Detection (OCD).\"\n\n* '''No \"here\" links.'''  Linking\
      \ along the lines of \"Click [[:Category:Legacy Personal Page|here]] to get\
      \ a list of contributors\" is ''very'' bad style and detrimental to readability.\
      \  If you by any means can, link the actual page titles.\n\n==Related Topics\
      \ links==\n\nMost pages have a section at the end titled \"Related Topics\"\
      . List here all the links which don't fit into the text of the page.\n\nIt's\
      \ helpful to commment on how the links relate to the current page.\n\n==External\
      \ links ==\n\nExternal links are altered and re-routed all the time because\
      \ people change servers, or lose interest in maintaining the structure, or eliminate\
      \ the page because it becomes obsolete. It might be an idea to occasionally\
      \ check external links.\n\nOn the other hand, the interest of 'wiki' is precisely\
      \ to avoid links at all costs and make the most comprehensive thing in one place.\n\
      \n==Category links ==\n\nLinks to category pages are usually put at the foot\
      \ of a page, beneath a rule-off ('----' in markup). However, category pages\
      \ that count as a related topic, eg \"Category Mapping\" can go in the Related\
      \ Topics section.\n\n'''T1:''' So does this mean we should always put the link\
      \ in both places, or choose based on the situation? I vote for the \"both places\"\
      \ choice if it's up for vote.\n\n'''OlympusMons:''' I thought the ''Topics on\
      \ whatever'' would go in the ''related topics'' where the ''catergories'' would\
      \ go in the well ''catergory links'' unless the ''catergories'' is moved above\
      \ the ''related topics''. Preferrably Id like to see ''related topics'' at the\
      \ tops of the page with the ''catergories'' on the bottom but this isnt a huge\
      \ issue. I think actually getting the main pages for everything to some sort\
      \ of complete status would be then we can discuss formatting once ut2k7 is alittle\
      \ closer. Also I have seen pages with links up the top, they are under ''required\
      \ reading''.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'd say if the category link is in the related\
      \ topics, only 1 copy is needed. But having 2 won't do any harm :)\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ I agree that it can be considered a Related Topic, but if all the other pages\
      \ are formatted one way and we begin to subjectively change ''some'' of them,\
      \ what's the point?  And where would the line be drawn?  To me, they seem to\
      \ be nearly in the same location on the page; near the bottom along with External\
      \ Links, etc.  They also seem to be a separate kind of page, one that uses the\
      \ MAGIC keyword to group all pages, but itself is not a page containing topic\
      \ info.  You're right, there's no ''harm'' done either way, but if we're going\
      \ to have a standard or method to this madness, I vote that it stay consistent.\
      \ (at the bottom, under a rule-off and grouped with other category and wiki\
      \ tags.) /my $0.02 ''(Btw, I've recieved an email from Ch3z, and from that it\
      \ doesn't sound to me like he's interested in coming back.  I dunno.)''\n\n\
      ==InterMap ==\n\nWe're running an intermap: that means that certain wiki-type\
      \ links lead to other Wiki sites. A wiki link with a prefix and a : separator\
      \ creates an interwiki link:\n <nowiki>[[Wikipedia:fish]]</nowiki>\n\nSee [[Legacy:InterWiki|InterWiki]]\
      \ for more.\n\nNote the prefix is (annoyingly) case-sensitive. The most commonly\
      \ used ones are:\n\n* udntech \n* udncontent \n* Thread \n* Posting \n* Wikipedia\
      \ \n* Wiki \n* UseMod \n* MeatBall"
