      <p><b>Birelli:</b> Whose spelling are we using? We're going to waste a lot of\
      \ time if we spend it \"correcting\" other people's spelling to our own, because\
      \ others will just change it back. There are genuine disagreements here, not\
      \ just \"mistakes\". The most obvious of them (and the one that prompted this)\
      \ is \"color\" vs. \"colour\", but there is also \"center\" vs. \"centre\" and\
      \ tons more in the same vein as both of these.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I've\
      \ previously said we can use both; Mych has suggested we use US spelling everywhere.\
      \ I don't really mind that much, as long as people get apostrophes right&#160;;)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Adhering to a consistent way of spelling (at least in page\
      \ titles) makes searching easier and avoids accidental mis-linking of pages\
      \ and/or creation of page doubles (one American English version, one British\
      \ English version; as in modeling/modelling). That's the pragmatic approach\
      \ and the most striking argument here, I believe.</p>\n<p>I'm neither British\
      \ nor American (English lessons in school somewhat favored British English),\
      \ but I've personally decided sometime that I'd try stick to the American English\
      \ spelling of words – it's generally simpler (which appeals to the programmer\
      \ in me), and most importantly it's far more widespread.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ I don't know which spellings belong to which, I generally just use whichever\
      \ I feel like at the time. I usually use center and color, but words like armour\
      \ or modelling I just use whichever spelling I like. Having said that, anyone\
      \ is welcome to change the spelling on any page I've written to comply to a\
      \ wiki standard if one is agreed upon.</p>\n<p><b>Birelli:</b> Being American\
      \ it's obviously a lot easier for me to follow a US-english standard, but I\
      \ know how hard it can be to constantly remind yourself to spell things in a\
      \ way that feels wrong. Perhaps it would be best to say that the Wiki is using\
      \ a US standard, but ignore differences if they're in text that doesn't affect\
      \ technical things. Links kind of have to be stringently enforced though, as\
      \ with the modeling/modelling example.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> If (when, I\
      \ mean, of course) the new search engine outlined on <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_Development\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Wiki Development\">Wiki Development</a> becomes reality sometime\
      \ in future, it might be possible to provide it with a list of British/American\
      \ English word pairs to make it more liberal in terms of spelling; so a search\
      \ for \"colour\" would also find pages containing only the word \"color.\"</p>\n\
      <p><b>dUc0N:</b> What about \"disambiguation\" pages like those on WikiPedia?\
      \ The concept is a set of pages that offer links to documents you were probably\
      \ looking for. For example, on WikiPedia, the 'Mercury' page would have links\
      \ to the element, the planet, the car, the record label, the NASA manned spaceflight\
      \ project and the Roman god. Another type of page like this could cover spelling\
      \ differences. For example, use US spelling as the convention for the site,\
      \ but for a page with Color in the title, add a page where it's spelled Colour,\
      \ but redirects to the US spelling version. Thoughts?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ redirects for alternate spellings are a good idea.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b>\
      \ definately is spelt correctly&#160;:) Or at least thats how we spell it here\
      \ in Canada... or I spell it....</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Well, then you probably\
      \ spell it incorrectly: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"\
      http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=definately\">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=definately</a></p>\n\
      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> Sigh. Well that just sucks. (Updating Brain-Dictionary)</p>\n\
