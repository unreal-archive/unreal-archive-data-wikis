    text: "<p><b>Note:</b> This tutorial applies mostly to Unreal Tournament. It is\
      \ also very hard to do clearly so if you have any questions or corrections,\
      \ please add them in as comments. I can now see why so few tuts on this subject\
      \ exist&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Discaimer:</b> This is the way I animate and import\
      \ weapons. There are approximately 1,000,345 different ways of doing it, with\
      \ at least 1,000,000 of them being more efficient/better than mine. What I am\
      \ passing on is what I learned by scouring the net for scant information on\
      \ the subject and just basic trial and error. What I do know is that this way\
      \ works&#160;:) To be honest I do things a bit more efficiently, but it is easier\
      \ to explain it this way and let the person reading it come up with their own\
      \ better ways of doing it after they are comfortable.</p>\n<p>In this tutorial\
      \ on making weapon models for Unreal Tournament using 3ds2unr, I'm assuming\
      \ that you are comfortable with 3D Studio Max R3.1 or later. 2.X should be fine\
      \ although you may find some features missing that I talk about (not sure).\
      \ This tutorial will not explain the in's and out's of modeling and texturing\
      \ your weapon, only the basics on how to animate it and export it correctly\
      \ into Unreal Tournament.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\">\n<div\

      \ with one texture, I will explain multi-textured first person view weapon models\
      \ later):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Face the forward part of the model to the right in\
      \ the top viewport. This will save having to alter the script to get the model\
      \ facing the right way.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Name your weapon mesh Something00\
      \ (Something being whatever name you want).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It must not\
      \ be bigger than a 256x256 grid extent centered on the origin. You can scale\
      \ it to suit in script later so don't fret over that yet. All animations need\
      \ to reside inside the 256x256 box also (i.e. if the kickback animation leaves\
      \ the bounding box even by a decimal 3ds2unr will conk out on you).</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Place a blank material (or a multi sub-object material if it has more\
      \ than one texture) on the object called \"Skin\".</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Collapse\
      \ the stack or convert to an editable mesh (same outcome) and then go to <i>Utilities</i>\
      \ and choose <i>Reset X-Form</i> (<i>X-form</i> stands for \"transform,\" much\
      \ like <a href=\"/Legacy:Transform_Permanently\" title=\"Legacy:Transform Permanently\"\
      >Transform Permanently</a> works in UnrealEd). Converting to an editable mesh\
      \ even if it is already one is important before hitting <i>Reset X-Form</i>\
      \ to keep faces that you may have created or mirrored from flipping their normals.\
      \ Hit the <i>Reset Selected</i> button and then collapse the stack again. This\
      \ ensures the pivot point is nicely centered after import into Unreal Tournament.</li>\n\

      >Quick Explanation of Vertex Animation</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\
      ><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:3D_Studio_Max_Weapon_Modeling_And_Import?section=3\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Quick Explanation of Vertex Animation\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Vertex animation\
      \ works like this: Each frame of animation is basically a copy of the mesh,\
      \ just slightly different, like the little stick figure cartoons you used to\
      \ draw in school on little pads of paper (you flip the pages and it animates).\
      \ The .3d files (the file format vertex animation in UT uses) contains a model\
      \ with these frames of animation and is basically X number of copies of the\
      \ model super-imposed on one another with X being the number of frames.</p>\n\
      <p>In Max we use the <i>Snapshot</i> tool to make these super-imposed versions\
      \ of our animated model. The product of this is what gets exported from Max\
      \ as the .3ds file. The <i>Snapshot</i> tool asks what frames you want super-imposed\
      \ (0-15 for example), the number of copies (in our example it would be 16 since\
      \ 0-15 is 16 copies), and will do all the hard work for you. All this will be\
      \ explained in detail below.</p>\n<p>The beginning and ending of each animation\
      \ (if the animation begins or ends with the weapon in view) needs to have the\
      \ same exact postioning. For instance, a firing animation sequence starts, recoils\
      \ back, and comes back to rest in the exact same postion (it's \"rest\" postion)\
      \ it started in. If there is any difference, the gun will appear to jump around\
      \ in view and look terrible. A good rule of thumb is to save a seperate copy\
      \ of your .max file with a just a one frame animation of your weapon sitting\
      \ in it's \"rest\" position. The exception to this rule are animations that\
      \ start or end out of view such as a Select and Deselect animations which in\
      \ these cases the weapon only needs to end in it's \"rest\" postion and start\
      \ in it's \"rest\" postion, respectively.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>First, setup your 3D viewport window so the\
      \ gun looks as it would in first person. This can give you a semi-accurate view\
      \ of what it will look like animating in game. Save the Max file as something\
      \ like <code>Rest_Position.max</code> or whatever.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Now\
      \ move the animation slider to keyframe 1 or 2, hit the Animate button in the\
      \ lower right, and move/rotate your model into a kickback postion or however\
      \ it would be postioned when the weapon is fired. Turn off the Animate button,\
      \ select the first Keyframe at 0 and hold down shift (to clone the key) and\
      \ drag the cloned keyframe to keyframe 5. Now hit play to see it run through\
      \ it's firing sequence. It will do this fairly quickly but the code can slow\
      \ it down later when it's imported into the game. Jump back and forth from key\
      \ 1 and 5 to make sure the model doesn't move. Save this file as <code>Firing.max</code>\
      \ (or whatever as long as you know it's the firing animation file) and re-open\
      \ the \"rest\" postion .max file you saved earlier.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><span class=\"\

      \ will include in one file since both animations don't begin <i>and</i> end\
      \ in the \"rest\" posistion. Open your rest postion .max file, move the slider\
      \ to keyframe 10, hit the Animation button, and move/rotate your model out of\
      \ view below. Turn off the animation button. Now select the first keyframe at\
      \ 0, hold shift and clone/drag it to keyframe 20. Play the animation and it\
      \ should go out of view and then come back into view, ending at it's \"rest\"\
      \ postion. Save this file as <code>Select_Deselect.max</code> or something.</p>\n\

      \ animations (like the Impact-Hammer charging animation) where you want some\
      \ variety.</p>\n<p>We now have the minimum amount of animations needed to get\
      \ a weapon into UT. Actually we still need a 1 frame \"Still\" animation that's\

      \ Select <i>OK</i>. You will now see a bunch of meshes including your original\
      \ mesh, each one called Something01 through Something05 (with Something00 being\
      \ your original mesh you snapshotted). Press <b>H</b> (the <i>Select by Name</i>\
      \ hotkey) and a window will pop up listing all the objects in your scene. Now\
      \ select Something01, hold down Shift, and while still holding Shift select\
      \ Something05. This will select Something01 and Something05 as well as all the\
      \ ones in between. Make sure you don't include Something00 (the source mesh\
      \ that was snapshotted) as 3ds2unr wants all meshes labeled from \"01-0X\" in\

      \ that requires an animation is called, it gets the info from a function in\
      \ the weapon's code. For instance, when a person presses the alt-fire on a Shockrifle,\
      \ the code knows to play the animation \"Fire2\" since it's called in the Shockrifle\
      \ code's alt-fire play animation function. Since every weapon has to have a\
      \ Select and Deselect animation and they are never looped or anything funky\
      \ like that, Epic saw fit to place those play animation functions in every weapon's\
      \ parent class, TournamentWeapon, and they chose \"Down\" and \"Select\" as\
      \ their animation names. So basically, if you name your Select and Deselect\
      \ animations as \"Select\" and \"Down\", you don't have to write the play animation\
      \ functions for them. If you must name them something else or want to change\
      \ the rate at which the select or deselect animation (or both) is played, you\
      \ can override the TournamentWeapon function in your weapon's code. This is\

    text: "'''Note:''' This tutorial applies mostly to Unreal Tournament. It is also\
      \ very hard to do clearly so if you have any questions or corrections, please\
      \ add them in as comments. I can now see why so few tuts on this subject exist\
      \ :)\n\n'''Discaimer:''' This is the way I animate and import weapons. There\
      \ are approximately 1,000,345 different ways of doing it, with at least 1,000,000\
      \ of them being more efficient/better than mine. What I am passing on is what\
      \ I learned by scouring the net for scant information on the subject and just\
      \ basic trial and error. What I do know is that this way works :) To be honest\
      \ I do things a bit more efficiently, but it is easier to explain it this way\
      \ and let the person reading it come up with their own better ways of doing\
      \ it after they are comfortable.\n\nIn this tutorial on making weapon models\
      \ for Unreal Tournament using 3ds2unr, I'm assuming that you are comfortable\
      \ with 3D Studio Max R3.1 or later. 2.X should be fine although you may find\
      \ some features missing that I talk about (not sure). This tutorial will not\
      \ explain the in's and out's of modeling and texturing your weapon, only the\
      \ basics on how to animate it and export it correctly into Unreal Tournament.\
      \ \n\n==Getting Started==\n\n'''Model Setup''' (note that this is for a weapon\
      \ with one texture, I will explain multi-textured first person view weapon models\
      \ later):\n\n* Face the forward part of the model to the right in the top viewport.\
      \ This will save having to alter the script to get the model facing the right\
      \ way.\n\n* Name your weapon mesh Something00 (Something being whatever name\
      \ you want).\n\n* It must not be bigger than a 256x256 grid extent centered\
      \ on the origin. You can scale it to suit in script later so don't fret over\
      \ that yet. All animations need to reside inside the 256x256 box also (i.e.\
      \ if the kickback animation leaves the bounding box even by a decimal 3ds2unr\
      \ will conk out on you).\n\n* Place a blank material (or a multi sub-object\
      \ material if it has more than one texture) on the object called \"Skin\".\n\
      \n* Collapse the stack or convert to an editable mesh (same outcome) and then\
      \ go to ''Utilities'' and choose ''Reset X-Form'' (''X-form'' stands for \"\
      transform,\" much like [[Legacy:Transform Permanently|Transform Permanently]]\
      \ works in UnrealEd). Converting to an editable mesh even if it is already one\
      \ is important before hitting ''Reset X-Form'' to keep faces that you may have\
      \ created or mirrored from flipping their normals. Hit the ''Reset Selected''\
      \ button and then collapse the stack again. This ensures the pivot point is\
      \ nicely centered after import into Unreal Tournament.\n\n==Animating==\n\n\
      ===Quick Explanation of Vertex Animation===\n\nVertex animation works like this:\
      \ Each frame of animation is basically a copy of the mesh, just slightly different,\
      \ like the little stick figure cartoons you used to draw in school on little\
      \ pads of paper (you flip the pages and it animates). The .3d files (the file\
      \ format vertex animation in UT uses) contains a model with these frames of\
      \ animation and is basically X number of copies of the model super-imposed on\
      \ one another with X being the number of frames.\n\nIn Max we use the ''Snapshot''\
      \ tool to make these super-imposed versions of our animated model. The product\
      \ of this is what gets exported from Max as the .3ds file. The ''Snapshot''\
      \ tool asks what frames you want super-imposed (0-15 for example), the number\
      \ of copies (in our example it would be 16 since 0-15 is 16 copies), and will\
      \ do all the hard work for you. All this will be explained in detail below.\n\
      \nThe beginning and ending of each animation (if the animation begins or ends\
      \ with the weapon in view) needs to have the same exact postioning. For instance,\
      \ a firing animation sequence starts, recoils back, and comes back to rest in\
      \ the exact same postion (it's \"rest\" postion) it started in. If there is\
      \ any difference, the gun will appear to jump around in view and look terrible.\
      \ A good rule of thumb is to save a seperate copy of your .max file with a just\
      \ a one frame animation of your weapon sitting in it's \"rest\" position. The\
      \ exception to this rule are animations that start or end out of view such as\
      \ a Select and Deselect animations which in these cases the weapon only needs\
      \ to end in it's \"rest\" postion and start in it's \"rest\" postion, respectively.\n\
      \n===Standard Animations===\n\n====Firing Animation====\n# First, setup your\
      \ 3D viewport window so the gun looks as it would in first person. This can\
      \ give you a semi-accurate view of what it will look like animating in game.\
      \ Save the Max file as something like <code>Rest_Position.max</code> or whatever.\n\
      \n# Now move the animation slider to keyframe 1 or 2, hit the Animate button\
      \ in the lower right, and move/rotate your model into a kickback postion or\
      \ however it would be postioned when the weapon is fired. Turn off the Animate\
      \ button, select the first Keyframe at 0 and hold down shift (to clone the key)\
      \ and drag the cloned keyframe to keyframe 5. Now hit play to see it run through\
      \ it's firing sequence. It will do this fairly quickly but the code can slow\
      \ it down later when it's imported into the game. Jump back and forth from key\
      \ 1 and 5 to make sure the model doesn't move. Save this file as <code>Firing.max</code>\
      \ (or whatever as long as you know it's the firing animation file) and re-open\
      \ the \"rest\" postion .max file you saved earlier.\n\n====Alt Firing Animation====\n\
      \nNow we need an altfire animation. If your weapon has no alt-fire, skip this\
      \ step. Pretty much just repeat the same process as above, saving the file as\
      \ <code>Alt_fire.max</code> or whatever.\n\n====Select and Deselect Animations====\n\
      \nNow for the Deselect and Select animations which we will include in one file\
      \ since both animations don't begin ''and'' end in the \"rest\" posistion. Open\
      \ your rest postion .max file, move the slider to keyframe 10, hit the Animation\
      \ button, and move/rotate your model out of view below. Turn off the animation\
      \ button. Now select the first keyframe at 0, hold shift and clone/drag it to\
      \ keyframe 20. Play the animation and it should go out of view and then come\
      \ back into view, ending at it's \"rest\" postion. Save this file as <code>Select_Deselect.max</code>\
      \ or something.\n\n===Looping Animations===\n\nIf you need any repetitious animations\
      \ that loop, such as a spinning barrel, only animate one cycle. For instance,\
      \ for the spinning barrel, only animate one rotation. Exceptions to this are\
      \ things like vibration animations (like the Impact-Hammer charging animation)\
      \ where you want some variety. \n\nWe now have the minimum amount of animations\
      \ needed to get a weapon into UT. Actually we still need a 1 frame \"Still\"\
      \ animation that's played when the weapon isn't doing anything but we can get\
      \ that from any other animation's \"rest\" frame so it doesn't need it's own\
      \ file.\n\n==Exporting Your Animations==\n\nExport your Fire/Alt-Fire and other\
      \ Standard Animations.\n\n# Open your <code>Firing.max</code> (or whatever)\
      \ file and select your weapon. Go to Tools>Snapshot. A window will pop up that\
      \ looks like this:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_3dsmax-snapshot.jpeg|center|]]\n\n# Click\
      \ the radio button labeled ''Range'', enter 0 for ''From'' and 5 for ''To''\
      \ and make sure the ''Mesh'' radio button is selected (it usually is by default).\
      \ Select ''OK''. You will now see a bunch of meshes including your original\
      \ mesh, each one called Something01 through Something05 (with Something00 being\
      \ your original mesh you snapshotted). Press '''H''' (the ''Select by Name''\
      \ hotkey) and a window will pop up listing all the objects in your scene. Now\
      \ select Something01, hold down Shift, and while still holding Shift select\
      \ Something05. This will select Something01 and Something05 as well as all the\
      \ ones in between. Make sure you don't include Something00 (the source mesh\
      \ that was snapshotted) as 3ds2unr wants all meshes labeled from \"01-0X\" in\
      \ the .3ds file. Notice that Something01 is a copy of Something00. See Figure\
      \ B below for more info.\n\n# Now, while Something01 through Something05 is\
      \ selected, go to ''File'' -> ''Export Selected''. Export the meshes as a .3ds\
      \ file named <code>Fire.3ds</code>. Make sure you choose ''Export Selected''\
      \ and not just plain old ''Export''. Once finished, close the scene '''without\
      \ saving it'''.\n\n# Repeat the process for your alt-fire animation if you have\
      \ one and any other animations you need. Make sure you input the correct animation\
      \ frames and copies in the Snapshot tool window. For example, if your alt-fire\
      \ animation starts from 0 and ends at 13, enter From=0 and To=13 with 14 copies\
      \ (the 0 is inclusive!). Name your .3ds file <code>Altfire.3ds</code> or <code>Fire2.3ds</code>\
      \ or anything really.\n\n==Exporting Your Select and Deselect Animations==\n\
      # Since the Select and Deselect animations are in the same file we will do things\
      \ slightly different this time. We'll basically be snapshotting the file twice\
      \ since we need to export two .3ds files. Select your weapons and go to Tools>Snapshot\
      \ again. Select ''Range'', enter 0 in ''From'' and 10 in ''To'' and enter 11\
      \ in ''Copies''. Hit ''OK''. Hit '''H''', select Something01 through Something11,\
      \ hit ''OK'', choose ''Export Selected'' and export the files as <code>Down.3ds</code>.\
      \ It is important that you name it <code>Down.3ds</code> for reasons I will\
      \ explain below.\n\n# Now either ''Undo'' until you are back to before you snapshotted\
      \ the weapon, or close the file without saving and re-open it. Once back to\
      \ square one, select Snapshot, make sure ''Range'' is selected, enter 10 in\
      \ ''From'' and 20 in ''To''. Enter 11 for ''Copies'' and make sure ''Mesh''\
      \ is selected as the output. Hit ok. Hit '''H''', select Something01 through\
      \ Something11, choose ''Export Selected'' and name the exported file <code>Select.3ds</code>.\
      \ It is important to name this file <code>Select.3ds</code> for reason I will\
      \ explain below.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_3dsmax-selectobjects.jpeg|center|]]\n\n===Select/Deselect\
      \ Naming Conventions===\n\nIn UnrealScript, when an action that requires an\
      \ animation is called, it gets the info from a function in the weapon's code.\
      \ For instance, when a person presses the alt-fire on a Shockrifle, the code\
      \ knows to play the animation \"Fire2\" since it's called in the Shockrifle\
      \ code's alt-fire play animation function. Since every weapon has to have a\
      \ Select and Deselect animation and they are never looped or anything funky\
      \ like that, Epic saw fit to place those play animation functions in every weapon's\
      \ parent class, TournamentWeapon, and they chose \"Down\" and \"Select\" as\
      \ their animation names. So basically, if you name your Select and Deselect\
      \ animations as \"Select\" and \"Down\", you don't have to write the play animation\
      \ functions for them. If you must name them something else or want to change\
      \ the rate at which the select or deselect animation (or both) is played, you\
      \ can override the TournamentWeapon function in your weapon's code. This is\
      \ starting to leave the scope of this tutorial so just make sure you name them\
      \ \"Down\" and \"Select\".\n\n==Exporting the Still Animation==\n\nYou now need\
      \ a one frame animations called \"Still\". There are a few ways to do this with\
      \ the Snapshot tool (or without) but for simplicity we'll do it the same way\
      \ we did the others. Open the <code>Rest_Position.max</code> file, go to ''Tools''\
      \ -> ''Snapshot'', and enter 0 in ''From'' and 0 in ''To'', make the number\
      \ of ''Copies'' 1, and hit OK. Press '''H''', select Something01, hit OK, go\
      \ to Export Selected, and save it as <code>Still.3ds</code>.\n\nMove your .3ds\
      \ files that you exported into the same directory as your 3ds2unr.exe.  On to\
      \ Part2 [[Legacy:3ds2unr|3ds2unr]]\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Topics\
