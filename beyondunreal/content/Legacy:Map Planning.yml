      \ as well: \"Measure twice, cut once.\" The idea is that you can save time,\
      \ effort and materials by planning ahead and visualizing the design before work\
      \ begins. While some may swear by \"improvisational mapping\", most would have\
      \ to agree that mapping is hard work and takes long enough without mistakes\
      \ and miscalculations that require reworking, or worse, redoing.</p>\n<p>Once\
      \ the mapper has become inspired by some source to create a compelling design,\
      \ they can begin to define the details of the map and create a visualization\
      \ of a workable layout. Then before construction, the map designer can use their\
      \ visualizations to work out any problems that could arise with respect to appearance,\
      \ map flow or technical issues. After that, the mapper can proceed with construction,\
      \ confident that most of the potential \"show stopper\" problems have been solved\
      \ already.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that mappers aquaint themselves with the\

      \ be best served with a tight layout and a small number of players, or with\
      \ a grand landscape and several available vehicles? Should this design be small\
      \ but open-ended, or linear and very involved; required several steps to complete?\

      \ them down, it's time to think of how you're actually going to manifest your\
      \ ideas to the Unreal Editor. The idea now is to play with different layouts,\
      \ different designs. Try many different ways of configuring the elements of\
      \ the map design until you find things that work best. These are some methods\
      \ of solidifying the plan. Choose a method that is comfortable to you.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pencil_and_Paper\">Pencil and Paper</span><span\

      \ and Paper\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>This is a simplest form of visualizing. The drawing doesn't have to be pretty,\
      \ just functional and accurate enough to visualize walking through the layout.\
      \ Sketch out the floor plan; a top down view of the layout. Make several floor\
      \ plans for each level, if it's a multi-story layout. Sketch key unique elements\
      \ or features that will give the map it's character. Try using grid paper.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drawing_.2F_Painting_Application\">Drawing\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Drawing / Painting Application\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Instead of using a pencil\
      \ and paper, it might be easier for you to use a paint program. As with the\
      \ pencil and paper, make multiple drawings for each level of the layout and\
      \ try to make visual notes and representations of key unique elements of the\
      \ map. The advantage of using this method is you can take the resulting drawing\
      \ straight into the editor and use it as a guide during construction, by applying\
      \ it as a texture to a plane at the bottom of the editor space.</p>\n<h3><span\

      <p>Either with toy building blocks, clay, wood, paper or cardboard, simple models\
      \ can be made to represent the hallways, rooms, stairs, ledges, outdoor buildings,\
      \ etc. of your layout. These elements can be shifted around and playfully reconnected\
      \ to find a variety of layout designs.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ can be raided for their layout elements. Make a temporary test map. A hallway\
      \ can be cut from one map and pasted into the test map and combined with a stairway\
      \ from another map, or a room from a third map. While the walls may not line\
      \ up and the detail elements (such as textures, static mesh trim, etc.) may\
      \ not match, but the resulting test map should give an approximate representation\
      \ of a layout. You do not need to try and playtest the map (it will most likely\
      \ crash or be filled with HOMs), but you can easily navigate around the layout\
      \ through the editor. It is recommended that you keep the editor's grid lock\

      <p>Before construction begins, this is the time to use the visualizations to\
      \ expose potential problems with flow, appearance or techinical issues. When\
      \ problems do arise, you will only have to rework the visualization of your\

    text: "This page outlines techiniques and methods useful in planning a successful\
      \ map design.\n\n==Overview==\n\n{{innerbox| If you fail to plan, you plan to\
      \ fail. '''&ndash; Anonymous'''\n\n}}\n\nBuilding contractors have a saying\
      \ that is applicable to mappers as well: \"Measure twice, cut once.\"  The idea\
      \ is that you can save time, effort and materials by planning ahead and visualizing\
      \ the design before work begins.  While some may swear by \"improvisational\
      \ mapping\", most would have to agree that mapping is hard work and takes long\
      \ enough without mistakes and miscalculations that require reworking, or worse,\
      \ redoing.\n\nOnce the mapper has become inspired by some source to create a\
      \ compelling design, they can begin to define the details of the map and create\
      \ a visualization of a workable layout.  Then before construction, the map designer\
      \ can use their visualizations to work out any problems that could arise with\
      \ respect to appearance, map flow or technical issues.  After that, the mapper\
      \ can proceed with construction, confident that most of the potential \"show\
      \ stopper\" problems have been solved already.\n\nIt is recommended that mappers\
      \ aquaint themselves with the general concepts and elements of [[Legacy:Gameplay|Gameplay]],\
      \ [[Legacy:Map Design|Map Design]] and [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]] before proceeding.\n\
      \n==Inspirational Sources==\n\nInspiration can come from unconventional sources;\
      \ layout ideas can come from styrafoam packaging, texture ideas can come from\
      \ nature, unreal gameplay ideas can come from board games, etc.  Consider random\
      \ sources and experiment with limits of perception to find new ways of looking\
      \ at the world around you.  This section includes various links and ideas that\
      \ help find inspiration for map designs, themes or styles.\n\n===General===\n\
      * Look at existing maps to get an idea of what style you like, whether that\
      \ be a particular style of lighting or of architecture.\n* Take ideas from television\
      \ or films; the sets, the buildings, the lighting, the sounds (''for example,\
      \ the dark gothic tower in Batman or those seen in the Lord of The Rings trilogy'').\n\
      * Look at the wiki pages [[Legacy:Static_Mesh_Package|Static_Mesh_Package]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Texture_Package|Texture_Package]] when deciding what static meshes\
      \ and which textures to use in your map.\n\n===Topics===\n* [[Legacy:Map Ideas|Map\
      \ Ideas]] &ndash; The Wiki page on map ideas.\n\n===Links===\n* [http://www.castlewales.com/life.html\
      \ Rooms of a Castle] &ndash; What's needed to give an impression of people living\
      \ in your ancient arena.\n* [http://www.greatmirror.com/ GreatMirror.com] &ndash;\

      \ UP Forums \"Mapping Ideas\" Thread] &ndash; An ongoing discussion and exchange\
      \ of map ideas for the Unreal Engine.\n* [http://www.unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?p=554718\
      \ UP Forums \"Environmental Inspiration for Mappers\" Thread] &ndash; An ongoing\
      \ discussion with links to great environmental inspirations.\n* [http://www.creativitypool.com/\
      \ CreativityPool.com] &ndash; A site devoted to free idea exchange.\n\n==Planning==\n\
      \nThese are the primary ideas to organize for map design.  It is strongly recommended\
      \ that you write down your ideas as they come to you.  You may not end up using\
      \ them all, some may even be contradictory, but you will be in a stronger position\
      \ to design once you have all your ideas in once place.\n\n===Gametype===\n\n\
      Review any speical requirements for the [[Legacy:Gametype|gametype]] you are\
      \ mapping for.  Should the layout be open (like DeathMatch or Onslaught) or\
      \ more linear (like Assault or Capture The Flag)?  Does this gametype allow\
      \ vehicles?  What [[Legacy:GameObjective|GameObjective]]s are involved?  By\
      \ and large, the map design will be centered around the requirements and guidelines\
      \ of its designated gametype.\n\n===Goals===\n\nDefine the unique purpose of\
      \ the map.  What will make this map stand out from other maps of this gametype?\
      \  What will the focus of the map be?  What elements of the gameplay can be\
      \ affected by this design?  Write down one sentence that clearly defines the\
      \ unique goal for this map.\n\n===Theme===\n\nChoose a compelling theme.  Don't\
      \ be afraid to explore vastly different themes.  Often once one theme is fully\
      \ considered, another one comes to mind.  Sometimes the original theme idea\
      \ is strengthened by considering others.  Pick one theme that will strongly\
      \ address the goal for this map.\n\n===Scope===\n\nDefine the size of this map's\
      \ gameplay.  Based on the goal and theme of the map, make decisions about the\
      \ scale of the map size, the number of players this map should hold, the number\
      \ or difficulty of the game objectives (if this gametype has them).  Would this\
      \ map's goal and theme be best served with a tight layout and a small number\
      \ of players, or with a grand landscape and several available vehicles?  Should\
      \ this design be small but open-ended, or linear and very involved; required\
      \ several steps to complete?  Choose an approximate scope for this map based\
      \ on it's goal and theme; make notes on map size, suggested player count, game\
      \ objectives, etc. \n\n===Special Features===\n\nAny unique elements of this\
      \ map should be clearly defined and possibly tested separately before further\
      \ work is done.  Are there elements that you can imagine that would strongly\
      \ support the goal, theme and scope of this map?  Will this map need custom\
      \ static meshes?  A new particle effect?  A unique trigger system?  Identify\
      \ these special features early and make note of them.\n\n==Visualizing==\n\n\
      After you have thought of a few ideas and written them down, it's time to think\
      \ of how you're actually going to manifest your ideas to the Unreal Editor.\
      \  The idea now is to play with different layouts, different designs.  Try many\
      \ different ways of configuring the elements of the map design until you find\
      \ things that work best.  These are some methods of solidifying the plan.  Choose\
      \ a method that is comfortable to you.\n\n===Pencil and Paper===\n\nThis is\
      \ a simplest form of visualizing.  The drawing doesn't have to be pretty, just\
      \ functional and accurate enough to visualize walking through the layout.  Sketch\
      \ out the floor plan; a top down view of the layout.  Make several floor plans\
      \ for each level, if it's a multi-story layout.  Sketch key unique elements\
      \ or features that will give the map it's character. Try using grid paper.\n\
      \n===Drawing / Painting Application===\n\nInstead of using a pencil and paper,\
      \ it might be easier for you to use a paint program.  As with the pencil and\
      \ paper, make multiple drawings for each level of the layout and try to make\
      \ visual notes and representations of key unique elements of the map.  The advantage\
      \ of using this method is you can take the resulting drawing straight into the\
      \ editor and use it as a guide during construction, by applying it as a texture\
      \ to a plane at the bottom of the editor space.\n\n===Cutouts / Models===\n\n\
      Either with toy building blocks, clay, wood, paper or cardboard, simple models\
      \ can be made to represent the hallways, rooms, stairs, ledges, outdoor buildings,\
      \ etc. of your layout.  These elements can be shifted around and playfully reconnected\
      \ to find a variety of layout designs.  \n\n===Segmenting Layouts (\"Frankenmapping\"\
      )===\n\nIn the editor, other maps (or '''copies''' of them) can be raided for\
      \ their layout elements.  Make a temporary test map.  A hallway can be cut from\
      \ one map and pasted into the test map and combined with a stairway from another\
      \ map, or a room from a third map.  While the walls may not line up and the\
      \ detail elements (such as textures, static mesh trim, etc.) may not match,\
      \ but the resulting test map should give an approximate representation of a\
      \ layout.  You do not need to try and playtest the map (it will most likely\
      \ crash or be filled with HOMs), but you can easily navigate around the layout\
      \ through the editor.  It is recommended that you keep the editor's grid lock\
      \ enabled at all times.\n\n==Early Testing==\n\nBefore construction begins,\
      \ this is the time to use the visualizations to expose potential problems with\
      \ flow, appearance or techinical issues.  When problems do arise, you will only\
      \ have to rework the visualization of your design, not the construction of the\
      \ design, so it should come as a relief rather than a frustration.\n\n===Basic\
      \ Gameplay===\n* Review the requirements and guidelines for the [[Legacy:Gametype|gametype]]\
      \ this map is designed for and check it against your current design.\n* Take\
      \ this opportunity to review the elements and concepts of [[Legacy:Map Design|Map\
      \ Design]] and see how your current design measures up.\n* Imagine yourself\
      \ playing this map; reaching objectives, attacking, defending, playing on different\
      \ teams, etc.  You may become further inspired to make changes based on elements\
      \ that you find during this process.\n\n===Sight Lines===\n* Review the look\
      \ of the layout from all angles and all points in the map.  You may find spots\
      \ to improve or elements you would like to highlight.\n* Check to make sure\
      \ the map doesn't provide huge, long-range vista views.  This could prove to\
      \ be a framerate killer later on.\n* Look for architechture that might improve\
      \ in appearance with a little layout adjustment, check for lighting hotspots\
      \ or dark holes, find bland spots in the map and think of ways to make them\
      \ interesting.\n\n===Map Flow===\n* Look for dead ends, long narrow hallways\
      \ or other elements that will kill [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]].\n* Visualize\
      \ a player navigating your layout between random points in the map.  Is there\
      \ an obvious problem getting from here to there?  Make adjustments that will\
      \ allow a player to get anywhere from anywhere fairly quickly.\n* Does the layout\
      \ make good use of the [[Legacy:Z-Axis|Z-Axis]] with plenty of vertical movement\
      \ and vertical combat options?  Make notes on good spots to place [[Legacy:UTJumpPad|UTJumpPad]]s,\
      \ [[Legacy:Mover|Mover]]s, [[Legacy:Teleporter|Teleporter]]s, or the like. \
      \ Think about opening up something like windows or grates in the floor or ceiling.\n\
      * Make notes on good spots to place PlayerStarts, Inventory Items, Vehicle Factories\
      \ and the GameObjectives.\n\n===Technical Issues===\n\nMake a note of the technical\
      \ elements of the map and think about testing them separately '''before''' you\
      \ begin construction.\n* Will this map need special [[Legacy:Trigger Systems|Trigger\
      \ Systems]]?  Can you do it with a [[Legacy:ScriptedTrigger|ScriptedTrigger]]?\n\
      * Are there any elements that can't be created with stock Objects?  Can you\
      \ come up with a workaround or code your own custom Object?\n* Are the technical\
      \ elements of your map <u>too</u> technical?  Would they essentially require\
      \ a custom mod or mutator?  Test out the elements early on to avoid basing your\
      \ map on something that you can't complete.\n\n====A Note About Techincal Elements====\n\
      \nThink about what it is you're capable of.  There's no shame in asking another\
      \ more experienced mapper to help if they are willing and have the time; you\
      \ could learn from them and pick up a few useful hints along the way. Just a\
      \ friendly word of advice: if you do get help from someone else in the mapping\
      \ process, always grant them some of the credit in the Readme file.  It shows\
      \ you're grateful to them for taking the time and for helping you learn something\
      \ useful.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Gameplay|Gameplay]]\n* [[Legacy:Map\
