      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This is one of the most problematic\
      \ reasons to be building a mod.</p>\n<p>Statistically speaking, the ratio of\
      \ working, widely accepted total conversions for FPS games (HL, UT in particular)\
      \ to the number of ideas out there is very low. There are maybe 10 HL \"large\
      \ mods\" (e.g. DoD, CS, etc.) which have been widely popular, and even fewer\
      \ UT mods (I can think of only 1 off the top of my head, which is TacOps).</p>\n\
      <p>In fact, simply by making a game modification under a EULA and not a professional\
      \ license, you put yourself in a very strange place to try and get something\
      \ published. You are essentially developing new content for a published game\
      \ for free. The basics of your game are inherently owned by someone else. This\
      \ would be something like trying to build your dream house on someone else's\
      \ land.</p>\n<p>That is not to say mod work won't help you get a job. In fact,\
      \ many industry professionals began in the mod community. There is a lot of\
      \ blending between the amateur and professional communities these days. Still,\
      \ the game industry is relatively small compared to its audience - and that\
      \ includes modders. If you are working on a mod because you want this to be\
      \ your profession - you should realize that just releasing one whiz bang thing\
      \ isn't going to get you a contract. Your best bet is to be passionate and professional\
      \ about what you're doing - just like an employer would want to see.</p>\n<p>So\
      \ if you are working on a mod to get a job be aware that it's not a guaranteed\
      \ way into the industry. By all means hold to that goal. If you put enough work\
      \ in you will most likely succeed eventually. However it's better that you work\
      \ on a mod because you enjoy it.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><b>Nuleo</b>: Oh come\
      \ on now. We all know you just want to eliminate the competition for the Make\
      \ Something Unreal Contest&#160;;D I mean half of the people who worked on UT\
      \ were once modders themselves. Ok, so if you are just making a minor modification\
      \ like a mutator something than you won't be the star of the next Gaming Conference\
      \ but what better way to demonstrate to game companies that you are capable\
      \ of producing high quality content than by making a mod (preferrably a Total\
      \ Conversion). And anyway, what else are you going to do short of be related\
      \ to the CEO, show them you're degree? LOL.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX</b>: It's the\
      \ last sentence that's most pertinent. There are lots of talented people in\
      \ the mod community - but there are only so many jobs out there. When mod teams\
      \ go into a project thinking \"we're going to make a bushel of money\" (and\
      \ slowly, they are actually starting to think just that) they generally end\
      \ up a) worrying about a lot of things completely unrelated to modding (ie lawyers),\
      \ b) worrying about making a mod that they think will be popular/marketable\
      \ - not necessarily new and fun or innovative, and most of all c) fail.</p>\n\
      <p>Bottom line - I've worked with some people who were completely professional/perfectionists/etc\
      \ - and they undoubtably have some good stuff in their portfolio by the end\
      \ of the day. But that's not why they were making stuff...</p>\n<p><b>Nuleo</b>:\
      \ Well everyone does things because they enjoy it, and if not than thats unfortunate.\
      \ And if you can make money doing what you enjoy than thats even better. I suppose\
      \ its a matter of opinion and up to each individual \"Why I am making a mod\"\
      \ and we just have different opinions. If you are just making a mod for yourself,\
      \ some friends, and maybe a few other people to play than yeah, don't expect\
      \ publicity or money. But if you think you have the skills and the talent (and\
      \ the people) to make a truly compelling experience than you should go for broke\
      \ (again, I am refering to total conversions not small modifications). From\
      \ my personal experience, mods don't \"fail\" because people expect too much\
      \ but because they expect too little of themselves; They don't take the mod\
      \ seriously or they make the excuses such as \"I don't have enough time\" or\
      \ they can't handle focusing and working hard for the long haul and I guess\
      \ for some its the get rich quick thing but I think you have to be pretty out\
      \ of it to believe you are going to make any huge amount of money from a mod\
      \ in and of itself. My advice to modders - Keep your feet on the ground but\
      \ Aim High&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> \"And if you can make money doing\
      \ what you enjoy than thats even better.\" &lt;- But not with UT2003. (Words\
      \ like \"EULA\" come to mind...) You can have a lot of publicity without even\
      \ expecting it, btw.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> That is true, but a mod can also\
      \ go commercial if it's popular enough - like counterstrike, tactical ops, or\
      \ team fortress 2. (I've actually never seen that one in stores, so maybe it\
      \ got cancelled.) Also there's money to be made in the MSU contest plus if you\
      \ take the top prize you can make a commercial version of your mod. So I wouldn't\
      \ say that it's not possible to make money using UT2003.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b>\
      \ TF2 was never a mod - but a commercial sequel, the TF team was swallowed up\
      \ with Half-Life. But you could count Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, Day of\
      \ Defeat, Gunman Chronicles, and Tac Ops. Rumors are floating that Natural Selection\
      \ will go pro as well. So that's six mods out of literally hundreds of projects,\
      \ and most of them due to Valve's desire to keep the Half-Life engine selling\
      \ past it's expiration date. Then you could factor in all the individuals who\
      \ have gotten jobs (ie Epic).</p>\n<p>Sure it's certainly beneficial to getting\
      \ into the industry - but that's not the point. It's the wrong end to be starting\
      \ from. Talented people with a passion for these things are most likely to get\
      \ a job, whether they join a mod team or not. People who are scrambling to put\
      \ code and maps together because they think that they will have the next Counter-Strike\
      \ and see their game in stores, are (imho) doing the wrong thing for the wrong\
      \ reasons and as Wormbo pointed out - with the wrong license.</p>\n<p>I think\
      \ the MSUC is walking a fine line between trying to reward mod projects for\
      \ doing really creative work and trying to get modsters to think about being\
      \ marketable. I think it's a great thing, and I love seeing more people get\
      \ involved in the process - but my guess is that come March 15th, you'll suddenly\
      \ see a bunch of people magically lose interest in building mod content when\
      \ they don't have a license to win for anymore. And that's what I mean by the\
      \ wrong reasons.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I realize that TF2 was never a mod,\
      \ but what I meant was, making the free mod generated the community that TF2\
      \ was going to be marketed to - so that's the commercial connection. I agree\
      \ that the majority of mod projects won't ever end up making any money. Heck,\
      \ most mod projects don't even make it to beta stage. I just think that it's\
      \ inaccurate to say that you can't make money at all doing it.</p>\n<p><b>Lilguy:</b>\
      \ I think the last paragraph about making mods for money needs to be renamed/re-thought,\
      \ perhaps to \"I want to get my mod published\" First of all, a distinction\
      \ needs to be made between making a mod with hopes that it will go commercial,\
      \ and making a mod with hopes that a developer will take notice of your talent\
      \ and hire you to work on some other game. While the first may be wishful thinking,\
      \ the second is hands-down the best way to get into the industry – I'm living\
      \ proof of that. My Apprehension mod hasn't been released yet, but I was still\
      \ made an offer from Ravensoft after showing them my code (and of course, my\
      \ CS degree)</p>\n<p>I think it's sort of an elitist attitude that people shouldn't\
      \ want to make money by modding – it's OK to want to make your favorite hobby\
      \ into a carreer. I do agree that making mods that aim to be marketable is a\
      \ problem, but it's a problem that exists in the industry itself, and can't\
      \ really be blamed on a contest.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b> I would agree with\
      \ your edit suggestion - it makes a more clear distinction between trying to\
      \ make money by creating a quasi-commercial game and trying to break into the\
      \ industry by padding your portfolio. I certainly don't think there's anything\
      \ wrong with showing off good work to professionals in the hopes of getting\
      \ hired. As for the MSUC, I don't blame it for creating the atmosphere (I lay\
      \ that at Valve's feet) - but I do blame it for encouraging it. About half way\
      \ through - Epic paid close attention to marketable mods and got a bit myopic\
      \ (imho). I had entered the contest hoping to get some quality feedback from\
      \ professionals, and mostly what I got was \"why don't you get custom models?\"\
      \ When I asked about altered models for entry into MSUC, the response I got\
      \ was \"Yes, that's OK - but you know you can't box it like that.\" At this\
      \ point I'm thinking there needs to be a distinction made between trying to\
      \ mod an engine and trying to setup a development studio without paying for\
      \ a license.</p>\n<p>And I'm not btw, saying that Epic are nothing but greedy\
      \ bastards trying desperately to churn out a Counter-Strike to be like Valve.\
      \ Like I've said, I have pretty mixed feelings about MSUC. Overall, I think\
      \ it was great and the community got some awesome, high quality mods and UT2004\
      \ got the attention it deserves for being a moddable engine.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ If you are not happy with the page then change it. It was written at a time\
      \ (seems an age ago tbh) where there were many many people trying to put mod\
      \ teams together that were simply setting themselves up to fail - and destroy\
      \ whatever enthusiasm they had for modding in the process. Things seem to have\
      \ calmed down a bit - although to be fair I've been out of the modding scene\
      \ for over a year now so I don't really know. To be honest it's nice to see\
      \ the pages in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Mods\" title=\"Legacy:Making Mods\"\
      >Making Mods</a> section getting a bit of attention.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b>\
      \ Fine, fine. I took a stab at it. I didn't write the original, but I tried\
      \ to blend what I think was the original intent with a positive vibe on doing\
      \ good work to get a good job.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>Further tweaked.</p>\n\

      \ by someone else.  This would be something like trying to build your dream\
      \ house on someone else's land.\n\nThat is not to say mod work won't help you\
      \ get a job.  In fact, many industry professionals began in the mod community.\
      \  There is a lot of blending between the amateur and professional communities\
      \ these days.  Still, the game industry is relatively small compared to its\
      \ audience - and that includes modders.  If you are working on a mod because\
      \ you want this to be your profession - you should realize that just releasing\
      \ one whiz bang thing isn't going to get you a contract.  Your best bet is to\
      \ be passionate and professional about what you're doing - just like an employer\
      \ would want to see.\n\nSo if you are working on a mod to get a job be aware\
      \ that it's not a guaranteed way into the industry. By all means hold to that\
      \ goal.  If you put enough work in you will most likely succeed eventually.\
      \  However it's better that you work on a mod because you enjoy it.\n\n<br />\n\
      \n'''Nuleo''': Oh come on now.  We all know you just want to eliminate the competition\
      \ for the Make Something Unreal Contest ;D  I mean half of the people who worked\
      \ on UT were once modders themselves.  Ok, so if you are just making a minor\
      \ modification like a mutator something than you won't be the star of the next\
      \ Gaming Conference but what better way  to demonstrate to game companies that\
      \ you are capable of producing high quality content than by making a mod (preferrably\
      \ a Total Conversion).  And anyway, what else are you going to do short of be\
      \ related to the CEO, show them you're degree?  LOL.\n\n'''RegularX''':  It's\
      \ the last sentence that's most pertinent.  There are lots of talented people\
      \ in the mod community - but there are only so many jobs out there.  When mod\
      \ teams go into a project thinking \"we're going to make a bushel of money\"\
      \ (and slowly, they are actually starting to think just that) they generally\
      \ end up a) worrying about a lot of things completely unrelated to modding (ie\
      \ lawyers), b) worrying about making a mod that they think will be popular/marketable\
      \ - not necessarily new and fun or innovative, and most of all c) fail.  \n\n\
      Bottom line - I've worked with some people who were completely professional/perfectionists/etc\
      \ - and they undoubtably have some good stuff in their portfolio by the end\
      \ of the day.  But that's not why they were making stuff... \n\n'''Nuleo''':\
      \ Well everyone does things because they enjoy it, and if not than thats unfortunate.\
      \  And if you can make money doing what you enjoy than thats even better.  I\
      \ suppose its a matter of opinion and up to each individual \"Why I am making\
      \ a mod\" and we just have different opinions.  If you are just making a mod\
      \ for yourself, some friends, and maybe a few other people to play than yeah,\
      \ don't expect publicity or money.  But if you think you have the skills and\
      \ the talent (and the people) to make a truly compelling experience than you\
      \ should go for broke (again, I am refering to total conversions not small modifications).\
      \  From my personal experience, mods don't \"fail\" because people expect too\
      \ much but because they expect too little of themselves; They don't take the\
      \ mod seriously or they make the excuses such as \"I don't have enough time\"\
      \ or they can't handle focusing and working hard for the long haul and I guess\
      \ for some its the get rich quick thing but I think you have to be pretty out\
      \ of it to believe you are going to make any huge amount of money from a mod\
      \ in and of itself.  My advice to modders - Keep your feet on the ground but\
      \ Aim High :D\n\n'''Wormbo:''' \"And if you can make money doing what you enjoy\
      \ than thats even better.\" <- But not with UT2003. (Words like \"EULA\" come\
      \ to mind...) You can have a lot of publicity without even expecting it, btw.\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' That is true, but a mod can also go commercial if it's popular\
      \ enough - like counterstrike, tactical ops, or team fortress 2. (I've actually\
      \ never seen that one in stores, so maybe it got cancelled.) Also there's money\
      \ to be made in the MSU contest plus if you take the top prize you can make\
      \ a commercial version of your mod. So I wouldn't say that it's not possible\
      \ to make money using UT2003.\n\n'''RegularX:''' TF2 was never a mod - but a\
      \ commercial sequel, the TF team was swallowed up with Half-Life.  But you could\
      \ count Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, Day of Defeat, Gunman Chronicles, and\
      \ Tac Ops.  Rumors are floating that Natural Selection will go pro as well.\
      \  So that's six mods out of literally hundreds of projects, and most of them\
      \ due to Valve's desire to keep the Half-Life engine selling past it's expiration\
      \ date.  Then you could factor in all the individuals who have gotten jobs (ie\
      \ Epic).\n\nSure it's certainly beneficial to getting into the industry - but\
      \ that's not the point.  It's the wrong end to be starting from.  Talented people\
      \ with a passion for these things are most likely to get a job, whether they\
      \ join a mod team or not.  People who are scrambling to put code and maps together\
      \ because they think that they will have the next Counter-Strike and see their\
      \ game in stores, are (imho) doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons and\
      \ as Wormbo pointed out - with the wrong license.\n\nI think the MSUC is walking\
      \ a fine line between trying to reward mod projects for doing really creative\
      \ work and trying to get modsters to think about being marketable.  I think\
      \ it's a great thing, and I love seeing more people get involved in the process\
      \ - but my guess is that come March 15th, you'll suddenly see a bunch of people\
      \ magically lose interest in building mod content when they don't have a license\
      \ to win for anymore.  And that's what I mean by the wrong reasons.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ I realize that TF2 was never a mod, but what I meant was, making the free\
      \ mod generated the community that TF2 was going to be marketed to - so that's\
      \ the commercial connection. I agree that the majority of mod projects won't\
      \ ever end up making any money. Heck, most mod projects don't even make it to\
      \ beta stage. I just think that it's inaccurate to say that you can't make money\
      \ at all doing it.\n\n'''Lilguy:''' I think the last paragraph about making\
      \ mods for money needs to be renamed/re-thought, perhaps to \"I want to get\
      \ my mod published\" First of all, a distinction needs to be made between making\
      \ a mod with hopes that it will go commercial, and making a mod with hopes that\
      \ a developer will take notice of your talent and hire you to work on some other\
      \ game. While the first may be wishful thinking, the second is hands-down the\
      \ best way to get into the industry &ndash; I'm living proof of that. My Apprehension\
      \ mod hasn't been released yet, but I was still made an offer from Ravensoft\
      \ after showing them my code (and of course, my CS degree)\n\nI think it's sort\
      \ of an elitist attitude that people shouldn't want to make money by modding\
      \ &ndash; it's OK to want to make your favorite hobby into a carreer. I do agree\
      \ that making mods that aim to be marketable is a problem, but it's a problem\
      \ that exists in the industry itself, and can't really be blamed on a contest.\n\
      \n'''RegularX:''' I would agree with your edit suggestion - it makes a more\
      \ clear distinction between trying to make money by creating a quasi-commercial\
      \ game and trying to break into the industry by padding your portfolio.  I certainly\
      \ don't think there's anything wrong with showing off good work to professionals\
      \ in the hopes of getting hired.  As for the MSUC, I don't blame it for creating\
      \ the atmosphere (I lay that at Valve's feet) - but I do blame it for encouraging\
      \ it.  About half way through - Epic paid close attention to marketable mods\
      \ and got a bit myopic (imho).  I had entered the contest hoping to get some\
      \ quality feedback from professionals, and mostly what I got was \"why don't\
      \ you get custom models?\"  When I asked about altered models for entry into\
      \ MSUC, the response I got was  \"Yes, that's OK - but you know you can't box\
      \ it like that.\" At this point I'm thinking there needs to be a distinction\
      \ made between trying to mod an engine and trying to setup a development studio\
      \ without paying for a license.\n\nAnd I'm not btw, saying that Epic are nothing\
      \ but greedy bastards trying desperately to churn out a Counter-Strike to be\
      \ like Valve.  Like I've said, I have pretty mixed feelings about MSUC.  Overall,\
      \ I think it was great and the community got some awesome, high quality mods\
      \ and UT2004 got the attention it deserves for being a moddable engine.  \n\n\
      '''EntropicLqd:''' If you are not happy with the page then change it.  It was\
      \ written at a time (seems an age ago tbh) where there were many many people\
      \ trying to put mod teams together that were simply setting themselves up to\
      \ fail - and destroy whatever enthusiasm they had for modding in the process.\
      \  Things seem to have calmed down a bit - although to be fair I've been out\
      \ of the modding scene for over a year now so I don't really know.  To be honest\
      \ it's nice to see the pages in the [[Legacy:Making Mods|Making Mods]] section\
      \ getting a bit of attention.\n\n'''RegularX:''' Fine, fine.  I took a stab\
      \ at it.  I didn't write the original, but I tried to blend what I think was\
      \ the original intent with a positive vibe on doing good work to get a good\
      \ job.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''Further tweaked.\n\n'''Lilguy:''' Thanks guys, very\
      \ nice work :)"
