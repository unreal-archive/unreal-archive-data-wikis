      <hr />\n<p><b>Spoon:</b> I agree with this. I think you need someone to get\
      \ the ball rolling, aka a project leader, after that let the individual's skill,\
      \ creativity, and experience take over. Don't micro manage your team. Come up\
      \ with a goal and let them communicate between each other to get it done. As\
      \ a project leader, your goal is to work on a kick ass website&#160;:D</p>\n\
      <p><b>Lilguy:</b>I hate to say it, but I strongly disagree with just about everything\
      \ on this page. The first paragraph is just plain confusing, and there are a\
      \ lot of claims in here without any sort of evidence or credibility. If there\
      \ are <i>any</i> mods out there which have been completed without a team leader\
      \ (and no, web designer doesn't = team leader) I bet you could count them on\
      \ one hand. To expect a group of amauture developers to get together, organize\
      \ a unified design, and create a game over a period of months or years, is very\
      \ naive in my opinion. I've found that simply organizing people's work and keeping\
      \ the specs up to date is just about a full-time job in itself.</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b>\
      \ Fraghouse doesn't have a team leader and look at all the mods they've made.\
      \ The Fraghouse Invasion Community Pack (which confusingly enough, was not made\
      \ by Fraghouse) didn't have a team leader either. If I paid more attention to\
      \ the mods out there, I'd probably know about more.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
