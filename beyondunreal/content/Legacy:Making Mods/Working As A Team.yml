      \ You have managed to pull a team of people together to work on a mod. Your\
      \ biggest problem now, apart from finishing the mod and getting people to play\
      \ it, is keeping your team enthused and together.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"Communicate.21\">Communicate!</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Making_Mods/Working_As_A_Team?section=2\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Communicate!\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Good communication is absoloutely key. The better\
      \ you get on as a group of people, the stronger your team will be when things\
      \ get tough. This is particularly important for mod teams as they are very rarely\
      \ co-located.</p>\n<p>Set up a fixed same time, same place meeting at least\
      \ once a week, two or three times if you can manage it. These fixed meetings\
      \ should be used to report progress and discuss the inevitable problems that\
      \ crop up. Keeping these sorts of meetings short is a good idea, but make sure\
      \ it's either over IRC or voice over IP. A forum is not a good place for a meeting.</p>\n\
      <p>If you have your meetings via IRC, make sure at least one person keeps a\
      \ log of the meeting. That way agreements, actions, and changes to the mod are\
      \ recorded. If someone doesn't have the log make sure it gets e-mailed to them.</p>\n\
      <p>IRC can be very \"spammy\". If you are having a meeting then show some restraint.\
      \ Make sure that someone has finished \"typing their piece\" before leaping\
      \ in with comments. While the team is fairly new, never ever insult someone,\
      \ even if it's in jest. Written text is often mis-interpreted. Equally, if you\
      \ think someone is having a dig at you, keep your fingers off the keyboard and\
      \ let it pass. By all means follow up any problems you may have with an e-mail,\
      \ but be restrained. Your \"attacker\" was most likely not intending to cause\
      \ offence. As you get to know each other and develop some \"trust\" this will\
      \ become less of an issue.</p>\n<p>If you use Voice-over-IP (VoIP) to have your\
      \ meetings, make sure you keep track of the discussions that occur, and make\
      \ sure that a written record gets sent to everyone involved in the mod – even\
      \ if they missed the meeting.</p>\n<p>E-mail conversations should be avoided\
      \ where possible. They are time consuming and very wasteful of resource. You\
      \ will save yourself much pain and frustration if you simply organise an ad-hoc\
      \ IRC or VoIP meeting. A discussion on a forum is to be preferred over an e-mail\
      \ conversation.</p>\n<p>Although forums are very poor for meetings they are\
      \ great for posting meeting records, progress, and non time-critical questions\
      \ and musings. Forums are well suited to the discussion of a non time-critical\
      \ feature for the mod. If you do use a forum, make sure everyone on the team\
      \ uses it. A dead development forum is pointless. If you have a question or\
      \ idea that doesn't need an immediate answer then a forum is a better medium\
      \ of communication than a bunch of e-mails flying backwards and forwards.</p>\n\
      <p>If you team members are going to be on-line at different times (because of\
      \ differences in time zones) then a forum is generally a more practical medium\
      \ for communication than IRC or VoIP. In this case team members that have a\
      \ question about a specific problem they can post it on the forum in the knowledge\
      \ that by the time they get back on-line the following day some sort of answer\
      \ will be waiting for them.</p>\n<p>It's well worth the teams effort to post\
      \ little individual progress updates on how things are going. For example your\
      \ coder might post an update to say that the primary fire for weapon X is finished.\
      \ These small updates may seem somewhat pointless, but they indicate that progress\
      \ is being made on the mod. There's nothing worse than working in a vacuum wondering\
      \ if anyone else is working on the mod or whether it's just you. Lots of small\
      \ updates can also provide an element of excitement as well as it indicates\
      \ that things are being finished. One of the nicest things about the use of\
      \ a forum is that you have the time and space to frame your thoughts in their\
      \ entirety.</p>\n<p>And finally a warning. If your team fails to communicate,\
      \ it's already dead.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Some_Things_to_Avoid\"\

      Edit section: Some Things to Avoid\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Do your level best to avoid adding features to the\
      \ mod while you are writing it. New features and ideas are bound to occur to\
      \ you as the mod develops. This is a natural and good thing. However, you should\
      \ observe the following rules.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure that any changes to\
      \ the current mod spec are agreed by all members of the team.</li>\n<li>Only\
      \ add new features if you cannot defer them to a later release.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>Many projects fail simply because the number of excellent features required\
      \ grow faster than they can be written. When this happens the mod never gets\
      \ finished.</p>\n<p>Respect the other team members responsibilities. In other\
      \ words, don't do their work for them. At best they'll appreciate the extra\
      \ help. At worst you will be duplicating work they've already done and create\
      \ bad feeling. The most likely outcome is that they'll be a bit annoyed that\
      \ you've taken \"some of their turf\". There are very few reasons for ever picking\
      \ up another team member's work and responsibilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They have\
      \ explicitly requested from help</li>\n<li>They have gone on holiday and know\
      \ that you may pick up some of their work (because you asked first)</li>\n<li>They\
      \ have quit the team (hopefully this won't happen).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And never\
      \ ever tell another member how <i>easy</i> something is unless you know exactly\
      \ what you're speaking of. And don't overestimate or underestimate someone.\
      \ I know that's quite difficult but overestimating someone might put too much\
      \ pressure on him/her and underestimating might give him the feeling of beeing\
      \ unimportant or worse, he's thinking of you as a know-it-all.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ section: Attitude is Everything\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The team's attitude to the mod and each other is fundamental\
      \ to the success of the mod. It is vitally important to attempt to be positive\
      \ about the mod at all times. Especially in the later stages of the mod when\
      \ the team will be sick of the site of it.</p>\n<p>Be flexible with each other.\
      \ Don't get hung up and stressed with a team member who requests a couple of\
      \ weeks off. Everyone needs time to let their batteries recharge once in a while.\
      \ Just because you can work non-stop for 20 hours a day every day for seven\
      \ days a week doesn't mean everyone else can. Allow team members some real life.\
      \ It will help keep the team healthy.</p>\n<p>Don't be possessive about your\
      \ particular set of responsibilities or deliverables. If you are a week late\
      \ delivering something, don't get upset if the team asks if you need some help.\
      \ Before you flatly refuse the offered help consider the offer carefully. It\
      \ may be that you could actually use the help.</p>\n<p>The team should try and\
      \ share as much information with each other as possible. This provides the team\
      \ with an excited buzz as all team members can see progress being made, and\
      \ work happening. It also means that the team has the opportunity to spot problems\
      \ and hitches in progress as soon as they start to appear. If you have more\
      \ than one developer working within the team then at the very least the developers\
      \ should walk each other through their code.</p>\n<p>It's well worth putting\
      \ some time into cross training each other. A team of generalists who have specific\
      \ areas of expertise is in a much better position to survive the loss of a team\
      \ member than a team of narrow skilled experts. Having team members cross train\
      \ each other will not only bring the team closer together but provide an avenue\
      \ for people to try things outside of their immediate area of expertise. Besides\
      \ which, everyone likes learning new stuff.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ that apparent antipathy against using forums for \"team meetings\" in the\
      \ first paragraphs comes from. Actually, I'm much more disinclined to use IRC\
      \ (shortlived, spammy, unstructured, unlinkable) or even Voice-over-IP (not\
      \ even possible to keep a useful record). Forums, on the other hand, encourage\
      \ thoughtful posting, structure, allow for posting additional media such as\
      \ images, are searchable and are kept around for future referencing. – I'd like\
      \ to have this matter discussed before changing anything about the text itself.</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> there's also something like a mailig list. It's just\
      \ not one or the other, using more tha one medium is often better, Forum\\Mailing\
      \ list\\NNTP and IRC is a good combination. Sometimes you just fast responses.\
      \ VoIP is juist chaotic for meetings.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> If you don't\
      \ like it change it. The reason I don't see a forum as being a good medium for\
      \ a \"meeting\" is because it doesn't fit my concept of a meeting. To me a meeting\
      \ is a short-lived and immediate discussion between two or more people about\
      \ a particular subject. It's the word immediate in my definition that precludes\
      \ the use of a forum for a meeting.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> EntropicLqd, I\
      \ like to make changes an <i>educated</i> decision, so I like to have a <i>discussion</i>\
      \ about what I feel needs a change. Otherwise I'd just change it. &#160;:-)\
      \ – Why is \"immediate\" such an important thing? I don't see a mention of that\
      \ term in the text above either; just a direct transition from \"you must communicate\"\
      \ (which without any doubt is true) to \"meeting\" to \"forums bad, IRC good.\"\
      \ If that's not what the text means to express, it's at the very least misleading.</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Immediacy is the very core of a meeting to my mind. That\
      \ immediacy and \"real time\" response is what separates a \"discussion\" via\
      \ a forum or e-mail (or whatever) from a \"meeting\". I'm treating them as two\
      \ distinct concepts. So, because of my requirement on immediacy for a \"meeting\"\
      \ it cannot take place effectively in a forum. Also, surely part of the requirement\
      \ of a meeting is that all of the meeting members have to be present and able\
      \ to communicate at the same time. Would you call our comments a meeting? No\
      \ - because it's not. We are not \"meeting\" as such. We in a discussion with\
      \ each point occuring at a distinct point in space. The text above starts with\
      \ a discussion about meetings. You can't have a meeting in a forum - but you\
      \ can have a discussion. The text certainly doesn't preclude the use of forums\
      \ - and even encourages it in some cases. All it really says is that a forum\
      \ is a bad place for a meeting - which to my mind is a true and valid statement.</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd>To be fair, when I wrote the page I simply threw down a bunch of stuff\
      \ that seemed sensible based on experience gained in the work place. I've never\
      \ been part of a mod team (there is no requirement for someone who can't even\
      \ guarantee an hour a night) so my musings above could be complete rubbish.\
      \ Looking at the page now it could probably do with some sub-headings splitting\
      \ out the various forms of communication and discussing the things they are\
      \ good for.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> In that case, I argue the importance\
      \ of having a <i>meeting</i> to discuss things. The emphasis is on <i>discussing</i>\
      \ things, and I think that forums are by far better suited for that than IRC\
      \ or VoIP. Granted, it's a different matter if you actually can meet physically\
      \ in real life – but meeting in person also opens the opportunity of using many\
      \ more communication channels than just speech.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I'd like\
      \ to have emphasis put on the important of <i>discussing</i> and <i>communicating</i>\
      \ in a team by whichever means is best suited for it, but not necessarily of\
      \ conducting <i>meetings</i> for that purpose. Different communication channels\
      \ such as forums, IRC, VoIP can be mentioned with their respective advantages\
      \ and disadvantages.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b> On the FH Team we use group emails\
      \ about 90% of the time, with emails usually 2-3 times a week. We catch up personally\
      \ on AIM and IRC from time to time but with people across huge time differences\
      \ and two continents, it's not really feasible (or necessary) to get everyone\
      \ talking at once. Communication is key for both keeping everyone up to date\
      \ with progress and also push the development along, but how that communication\
      \ takes place is probably up to the team.</p>\n<p><b>LegalAssassin:</b> All\
      \ of this text is good, and I think it's something all mods should follow (unless\
      \ they do already). However, what happens when these basic \"rules\" are broken\
      \ by a team member? IMO, the leader, if there's one, should make sure that the\
      \ rulebreaker either sticks to th plan or is removed from the team. But what\
      \ do you do when the leader refuses to do this, and, in example, makes drastic\
      \ changes in the plan because one guy demands it and others already working\
      \ by the basic plan? And what should you do if you love the mod and the plan,\
      \ but the lead allows one member of the team call other members \"cunt, dick,\
      \ moron\" etc? Also, if you are hired as a mapper, and instead you're doing\
      \ something else full time in order to help the modellers make the models more\
      \ accurate (per their request) - should you be considered useless/disposable?</p>\n\
      <p>These are rather tough questions, and to be honest I have tried to sort them\
      \ out for months without getting it quite right (if the general opinion is what\
      \ can be called \"right\"). Ideas? Thoughts?</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Every\
      \ book I've ever read on team-structure in IT states pretty much categroically\
      \ that as soon as you get someone from the \"dark-side\" in a team you need\
      \ to lose them fast unless you want the team to pretty much self-destruct -\
      \ or at the very best their morale sucked out of them.</p>\n<p>My own experience\
      \ bears this reccomendation out. As soon as you get someone who thinks they\
      \ are \"God's gift\", or someone who is just plain abusive - the team dynamic\
      \ becomes very defensive. If that person is not removed then the team over time\
      \ will become non-productive - spending more time putting defensive barriers\
      \ in place than actually producing anything. If that person is not removed then\
      \ you either live with the misery or leave. Once one or two people quit it normally\
      \ opens the floodgates and the innefective leader is left with the prima-donna\
      \ wondering where the hwll his team went.</p>\n<p>In the \"business world\"\
      \ it's a little easier to simply get up and go - the very nature of the IT business\
      \ means that you don't have as much of <i>yourself</i> invested in the work.\
      \ I turned down a job (along with a 20% pay-rise) once because I found out I\
      \ was going to be working with someone I knew to be a member of the \"dark-side\"\
      \ (having worked with them at a different job). It cost me money in the short-term\
      \ but I'm 100% convinced that I was happier for it.</p>\n<p>In the mod world\
      \ you are creating something because its fun, using your <i>own time</i>. And\
      \ that means that you have a lot of yourself invested in it. Walking out on\
      \ that is very hard. If you can still offset the misery against the satisfaction\
      \ of producing the mod then good luck. Its probably easier (and maybe more effective)\
      \ to organise a mass \"strike\" until the offender is removed.</p>\n<p>In my\
      \ opinion abuse should not be tolerated. And if someone is that good then they\
      \ should be trying to help out and <i>pass on</i> some knowledge. Not abusing\
      \ the troops.</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> Yeah, what strikes me as odd is that this\
      \ person is actually tolerated by other members of the team. In example, he's\
      \ a mapper, and as he didn't like the skin of a weapon (which was superb) he\
      \ decided he could do it better and sent the modeller a \"corrected version\"\
      , editing 50% of the weapon. The skinner \"went back to work on it\" (made the\
      \ original version even a bit better) and put a FINAL-tag on it. The mapper\
      \ sees it and goes on about what a useless skinner he is, as soon as he's not\
      \ in the room that is. Once the lead is notified, he gets away with \"don't\
      \ do that\". Still, from what I've heard, the team is supposed to be stable\
      \ now. I have a rather high tolerance, but the way this person acts and talk\
      \ shit about people once they leave the room, pretty much remakes the entire\
      \ mod and makes sure members get fired/quit, I can't really take that. Several\
      \ people left due to this situation, yet the lead considers this team member\
      \ invaluable.</p>\n<p>What's strange is that he's pretty average, not very good,\
      \ though very fast. Of course, he's fast as he's allowed to do whatever unlike\
      \ the other mappers, but still, he's really fast. Now, I don't see why a mapper\
      \ would be so impossible to replace, but that's not to be discussed here.</p>\n\
      <p>The question is, what should I have done different? As you said, I put a\
      \ lot of time into it, over 100 hours over the past six months doing careful\
      \ research out of which around what I did in 4 hours was used since the plan\
      \ was changed. So leaving wasn't much of an option. Any ideas would be nice...</p>\n\
      <p>Also, look at my personal page, I'll post something there too (unrelated,\
      \ sort of).</p>\n<p><b>Lilguy:</b> What we've used for Apprehension (pretty\
      \ effectively) is a combination of just about all these different forms of communications.\
      \ We use Ventrilo (voip) when a few of us are working on a specific coding project\
      \ or something, or we're testing the game and want to be able to talk about\
      \ gamplay as we go. We use a mailing list (which I see as another form of forum)\
      \ for discussing the major issues and answering questions. And on a personal\
      \ level, we use instant messenger programs to discuss things one-on one, and\
      \ when people are getting signed up initially.</p>\n<p>One other form of communication\
      \ that we've found critical is the versioning system (we use subversion, but\
      \ cvs works too). This is sort of implicit communication, since you immediately\
      \ see exactly what each member is contributing as he checks it in, and also\
      \ the logs are a sort of progress update that can be searched at any time.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Lei-Get:</b> Hello. I'm Lei-Get. I have to say that the best rule to follow\
      \ is actually one that the Bible says to follow: \"Treat other people the same\
      \ way you want them to treat you.\" I think this is the most important rule\
      \ in making a mod. The second being that, \"all the team members should work\
      \ for the same goal\". And the third being, \"stay as simple as possible.\"\

    text: "==Working as a Team ==\n\nIf you've managed to get this far you are doing\
      \ well.  You have managed to pull a team of people together to work on a mod.\
      \  Your biggest problem now, apart from finishing the mod and getting people\
      \ to play it, is keeping your team enthused and together.\n\n===Communicate!\
      \ ===\n\nGood communication is absoloutely key.  The better you get on as a\
      \ group of people, the stronger your team will be when things get tough.  This\
      \ is particularly important for mod teams as they are very rarely co-located.\n\
      \nSet up a fixed same time, same place meeting at least once a week, two or\
      \ three times if you can manage it.  These fixed meetings should be used to\
      \ report progress and discuss the inevitable problems that crop up.  Keeping\
      \ these sorts of meetings short is a good idea, but make sure it's either over\
      \ IRC or voice over IP.  A forum is not a good place for a meeting.\n\nIf you\
      \ have your meetings via IRC, make sure at least one person keeps a log of the\
      \ meeting.  That way agreements, actions, and changes to the mod are recorded.\
      \  If someone doesn't have the log make sure it gets e-mailed to them.\n\nIRC\
      \ can be very \"spammy\".  If you are having a meeting then show some restraint.\
      \  Make sure that someone has finished \"typing their piece\" before leaping\
      \ in with comments.  While the team is fairly new, never ever insult someone,\
      \ even if it's in jest.  Written text is often mis-interpreted.  Equally, if\
      \ you think someone is having a dig at you, keep your fingers off the keyboard\
      \ and let it pass.  By all means follow up any problems you may have with an\
      \ e-mail, but be restrained.  Your \"attacker\" was most likely not intending\
      \ to cause offence.  As you get to know each other and develop some \"trust\"\
      \ this will become less of an issue.\n\nIf you use Voice-over-IP (VoIP) to have\
      \ your meetings, make sure you keep track of the discussions that occur, and\
      \ make sure that a written record gets sent to everyone involved in the mod\
      \ &ndash; even if they missed the meeting.\n\nE-mail conversations should be\
      \ avoided where possible.  They are time consuming and very wasteful of resource.\
      \  You will save yourself much pain and frustration if you simply organise an\
      \ ad-hoc IRC or VoIP meeting.  A discussion on a forum is to be preferred over\
      \ an e-mail conversation.\n\nAlthough forums are very poor for meetings they\
      \ are great for posting meeting records, progress, and non time-critical questions\
      \ and musings.  Forums are well suited to the discussion of a non time-critical\
      \ feature for the mod.  If you do use a forum, make sure everyone on the team\
      \ uses it.  A dead development forum is pointless.  If you have a question or\
      \ idea that doesn't need an immediate answer then a forum is a better medium\
      \ of communication than a bunch of e-mails flying backwards and forwards.\n\n\
      If you team members are going to be on-line at different times (because of differences\
      \ in time zones) then a forum is generally a more practical medium for communication\
      \ than IRC or VoIP.  In this case team members that have a question about a\
      \ specific problem they can post it on the forum in the knowledge that by the\
      \ time they get back on-line the following day some sort of answer will be waiting\
      \ for them.\n\nIt's well worth the teams effort to post little individual progress\
      \ updates on how things are going.  For example your coder might post an update\
      \ to say that the primary fire for weapon X is finished.  These small updates\
      \ may seem somewhat pointless, but they indicate that progress is being made\
      \ on the mod.  There's nothing worse than working in a vacuum wondering if anyone\
      \ else is working on the mod or whether it's just you.  Lots of small updates\
      \ can also provide an element of excitement as well as it indicates that things\
      \ are being finished.  One of the nicest things about the use of a forum is\
      \ that you have the time and space to frame your thoughts in their entirety.\n\
      \nAnd finally a warning.  If your team fails to communicate, it's already dead.\n\
      \n===Some Things to Avoid ===\n\nDo your level best to avoid adding features\
      \ to the mod while you are writing it.  New features and ideas are bound to\
      \ occur to you as the mod develops.  This is a natural and good thing.  However,\
      \ you should observe the following rules.\n* Make sure that any changes to the\
      \ current mod spec are agreed by all members of the team.\n* Only add new features\
      \ if you cannot defer them to a later release.\n\nMany projects fail simply\
      \ because the number of excellent features required grow faster than they can\
      \ be written.  When this happens the mod never gets finished.\n\nRespect the\
      \ other team members responsibilities.  In other words, don't do their work\
      \ for them.  At best they'll appreciate the extra help.  At worst you will be\
      \ duplicating work they've already done and create bad feeling.  The most likely\
      \ outcome is that they'll be a bit annoyed that you've taken \"some of their\
      \ turf\".  There are very few reasons for ever picking up another team member's\
      \ work and responsibilities.\n* They have explicitly requested from help\n*\
      \ They have gone on holiday and know that you may pick up some of their work\
      \ (because you asked first)\n* They have quit the team (hopefully this won't\
      \ happen).\n\nAnd never ever tell another member how ''easy'' something is unless\
      \ you know exactly what you're speaking of. And don't overestimate or underestimate\
      \ someone. I know that's quite difficult but overestimating someone might put\
      \ too much pressure on him/her and underestimating might give him the feeling\
      \ of beeing unimportant or worse, he's thinking of you as a know-it-all.\n\n\
      ===Attitude is Everything ===\n\nThe team's attitude to the mod and each other\
      \ is fundamental to the success of the mod.  It is vitally important to attempt\
      \ to be positive about the mod at all times.  Especially in the later stages\
      \ of the mod when the team will be sick of the site of it.\n\nBe flexible with\
      \ each other.  Don't get hung up and stressed with a team member who requests\
      \ a couple of weeks off.  Everyone needs time to let their batteries recharge\
      \ once in a while.  Just because you can work non-stop for 20 hours a day every\
      \ day for seven days a week doesn't mean everyone else can.  Allow team members\
      \ some real life.  It will help keep the team healthy.\n\nDon't be possessive\
      \ about your particular set of responsibilities or deliverables.  If you are\
      \ a week late delivering something, don't get upset if the team asks if you\
      \ need some help.  Before you flatly refuse the offered help consider the offer\
      \ carefully.  It may be that you could actually use the help.\n\nThe team should\
      \ try and share as much information with each other as possible.  This provides\
      \ the team with an excited buzz as all team members can see progress being made,\
      \ and work happening.  It also means that the team has the opportunity to spot\
      \ problems and hitches in progress as soon as they start to appear.  If you\
      \ have more than one developer working within the team then at the very least\
      \ the developers should walk each other through their code.\n\nIt's well worth\
      \ putting some time into cross training each other.  A team of generalists who\
      \ have specific areas of expertise is in a much better position to survive the\
      \ loss of a team member than a team of narrow skilled experts.  Having team\
      \ members cross train each other will not only bring the team closer together\
      \ but provide an avenue for people to try things outside of their immediate\
      \ area of expertise. Besides which, everyone likes learning new stuff.\n\n===Summary\
      \ ===\n* Communicate.\n* Be flexible.\n* Don't get possessive.\n* Communicate.\n\
      * Respect other people's areas of responsibility.\n* Share all information as\
      \ much as possible.\n* Consider cross training.\n* Communicate.\n\n==Discussion==\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' I can ''not'' understand where that apparent antipathy against\
      \ using forums for \"team meetings\" in the first paragraphs comes from.  Actually,\
      \ I'm much more disinclined to use IRC (shortlived, spammy, unstructured, unlinkable)\
      \ or even Voice-over-IP (not even possible to keep a useful record).  Forums,\
      \ on the other hand, encourage thoughtful posting, structure, allow for posting\
      \ additional media such as images, are searchable and are kept around for future\
      \ referencing. &ndash; I'd like to have this matter discussed before changing\
      \ anything about the text itself.\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' there's also something\
      \ like a mailig list. It's just not one or the other, using more tha one medium\
      \ is often better, Forum\\Mailing list\\NNTP and IRC is a good combination.\
      \ Sometimes you just fast responses. VoIP is juist chaotic for meetings.\n\n\
      '''EntropicLqd:''' If you don't like it change it.  The reason I don't see a\
      \ forum as being a good medium for a \"meeting\" is because it doesn't fit my\
      \ concept of a meeting.  To me a meeting is a short-lived and immediate discussion\
      \ between two or more people about a particular subject.  It's the word immediate\
      \ in my definition that precludes the use of a forum for a meeting.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ EntropicLqd, I like to make changes an ''educated'' decision, so I like to\
      \ have a ''discussion'' about what I feel needs a change.  Otherwise I'd just\
      \ change it.  :-) &ndash; Why is \"immediate\" such an important thing?  I don't\
      \ see a mention of that term in the text above either; just a direct transition\
      \ from \"you must communicate\" (which without any doubt is true) to \"meeting\"\
      \ to \"forums bad, IRC good.\"  If that's not what the text means to express,\
      \ it's at the very least misleading.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Immediacy is the\
      \ very core of a meeting to my mind.  That immediacy and \"real time\" response\
      \ is what separates a \"discussion\" via a forum or e-mail (or whatever) from\
      \ a \"meeting\".  I'm treating them as two distinct concepts.  So, because of\
      \ my requirement on immediacy for a \"meeting\" it cannot take place effectively\
      \ in a forum.  Also, surely part of the requirement of a meeting is that all\
      \ of the meeting members have to be present and able to communicate at the same\
      \ time.  Would you call our comments a meeting?  No - because it's not.  We\
      \ are not \"meeting\" as such.  We in a discussion with each point occuring\
      \ at a distinct point in space.  The text above starts with a discussion about\
      \ meetings.  You can't have a meeting in a forum - but you can have a discussion.\
      \  The text certainly doesn't preclude the use of forums - and even encourages\
      \ it in some cases.  All it really says is that a forum is a bad place for a\
      \ meeting - which to my mind is a true and valid statement.\n: To be fair, when\
      \ I wrote the page I simply threw down a bunch of stuff that seemed sensible\
      \ based on experience gained in the work place.  I've never been part of a mod\
      \ team (there is no requirement for someone who can't even guarantee an hour\
      \ a night) so my musings above could be complete rubbish.  Looking at the page\
      \ now it could probably do with some sub-headings splitting out the various\
      \ forms of communication and discussing the things they are good for.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ In that case, I argue the importance of having a ''meeting'' to discuss things.\
      \  The emphasis is on ''discussing'' things, and I think that forums are by\
      \ far better suited for that than IRC or VoIP.  Granted, it's a different matter\
      \ if you actually can meet physically in real life &ndash; but meeting in person\
      \ also opens the opportunity of using many more communication channels than\
      \ just speech.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to have emphasis put on the important\
      \ of ''discussing'' and ''communicating'' in a team by whichever means is best\
      \ suited for it, but not necessarily of conducting ''meetings'' for that purpose.\
      \  Different communication channels such as forums, IRC, VoIP can be mentioned\
      \ with their respective advantages and disadvantages.\n\n'''RegularX:''' On\
      \ the FH Team we use group emails about 90% of the time, with emails usually\
      \ 2-3 times a week.  We catch up personally on AIM and IRC from time to time\
      \ but with people across huge time differences and two continents, it's not\
      \ really feasible (or necessary) to get everyone talking at once.  Communication\
      \ is key for both keeping everyone up to date with progress and also push the\
      \ development along, but how that communication takes place is probably up to\
      \ the team.\n\n'''LegalAssassin:''' All of this text is good, and I think it's\
      \ something all mods should follow (unless they do already). However, what happens\
      \ when these basic \"rules\" are broken by a team member? IMO, the leader, if\
      \ there's one, should make sure that the rulebreaker either sticks to th plan\
      \ or is removed from the team. But what do you do when the leader refuses to\
      \ do this, and, in example, makes drastic changes in the plan because one guy\
      \ demands it and others already working by the basic plan? And what should you\
      \ do if you love the mod and the plan, but the lead allows one member of the\
      \ team call other members \"cunt, dick, moron\" etc? Also, if you are hired\
      \ as a mapper, and instead you're doing something else full time in order to\
      \ help the modellers make the models more accurate (per their request) - should\
      \ you be considered useless/disposable?\n\nThese are rather tough questions,\
      \ and to be honest I have tried to sort them out for months without getting\
      \ it quite right (if the general opinion is what can be called \"right\"). Ideas?\
      \ Thoughts?\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Every book I've ever read on team-structure\
      \ in IT states pretty much categroically that as soon as you get someone from\
      \ the \"dark-side\" in a team you need to lose them fast unless you want the\
      \ team to pretty much self-destruct - or at the very best their morale sucked\
      \ out of them.\n\nMy own experience bears this reccomendation out.  As soon\
      \ as you get someone who thinks they are \"God's gift\", or someone who is just\
      \ plain abusive - the team dynamic becomes very defensive.  If that person is\
      \ not removed then the team over time will become non-productive - spending\
      \ more time putting defensive barriers in place than actually producing anything.\
      \  If that person is not removed then you either live with the misery or leave.\
      \  Once one or two people quit it normally opens the floodgates and the innefective\
      \ leader is left with the prima-donna wondering where the hwll his team went.\n\
      \nIn the \"business world\" it's a little easier to simply get up and go - the\
      \ very nature of the IT business means that you don't have as much of ''yourself''\
      \ invested in the work.  I turned down a job (along with a 20% pay-rise) once\
      \ because I found out I was going to be working with someone I knew to be a\
      \ member of the \"dark-side\" (having worked with them at a different job).\
      \  It cost me money in the short-term but I'm 100% convinced that I was happier\
      \ for it.\n\nIn the mod world you are creating something because its fun, using\
      \ your ''own time''.  And that means that you have a lot of yourself invested\
      \ in it.  Walking out on that is very hard.  If you can still offset the misery\
      \ against the satisfaction of producing the mod then good luck.  Its probably\
      \ easier (and maybe more effective) to organise a mass \"strike\" until the\
      \ offender is removed.\n\nIn my opinion abuse should not be tolerated.  And\
      \ if someone is that good then they should be trying to help out and ''pass\
      \ on'' some knowledge.  Not abusing the troops.\n\n'''Legal:''' Yeah, what strikes\
      \ me as odd is that this person is actually tolerated by other members of the\
      \ team. In example, he's a mapper, and as he didn't like the skin of a weapon\
      \ (which was superb) he decided he could do it better and sent the modeller\
      \ a \"corrected version\", editing 50% of the weapon. The skinner \"went back\
      \ to work on it\" (made the original version even a bit better) and put a FINAL-tag\
      \ on it. The mapper sees it and goes on about what a useless skinner he is,\
      \ as soon as he's not in the room that is. Once the lead is notified, he gets\
      \ away with \"don't do that\". Still, from what I've heard, the team is supposed\
      \ to be stable now. I have a rather high tolerance, but the way this person\
      \ acts and talk shit about people once they leave the room, pretty much remakes\
      \ the entire mod and makes sure members get fired/quit, I can't really take\
      \ that. Several people left due to this situation, yet the lead considers this\
      \ team member invaluable.\n\nWhat's strange is that he's pretty average, not\
      \ very good, though very fast. Of course, he's fast as he's allowed to do whatever\
      \ unlike the other mappers, but still, he's really fast. Now, I don't see why\
      \ a mapper would be so impossible to replace, but that's not to be discussed\
      \ here.\n\nThe question is, what should I have done different? As you said,\
      \ I put a lot of time into it, over 100 hours over the past six months doing\
      \ careful research out of which around what I did in 4 hours was used since\
      \ the plan was changed. So leaving wasn't much of an option. Any ideas would\
      \ be nice...\n\nAlso, look at my personal page, I'll post something there too\
      \ (unrelated, sort of).\n\n'''Lilguy:''' What we've used for Apprehension (pretty\
      \ effectively) is a combination of just about all these different forms of communications.\
      \ We use Ventrilo (voip) when a few of us are working on a specific coding project\
      \ or something, or we're testing the game and want to be able to talk about\
      \ gamplay as we go. We use a mailing list (which I see as another form of forum)\
      \ for discussing the major issues and answering questions. And on a personal\
      \ level, we use instant messenger programs to discuss things one-on one, and\
      \ when people are getting signed up initially.\n\nOne other form of communication\
      \ that we've found critical is the versioning system (we use subversion, but\
      \ cvs works too). This is sort of implicit communication, since you immediately\
      \ see exactly what each member is contributing as he checks it in, and also\
      \ the logs are a sort of progress update that can be searched at any time.\n\
      \n'''Lei-Get:''' Hello. I'm Lei-Get. I have to say that the best rule to follow\
      \ is actually one that the Bible says to follow: \"Treat other people the same\
      \ way you want them to treat you.\" I think this is the most important rule\
      \ in making a mod. The second being that, \"all the team members should work\
      \ for the same goal\". And the third being, \"stay as simple as possible.\"\
