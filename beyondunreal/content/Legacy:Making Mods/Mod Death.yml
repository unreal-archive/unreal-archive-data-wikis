      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The majority of mods that die before they start, start\
      \ in the same way. The \"project manager\" makes a post on a forum advertising\
      \ a \"great new mod idea, come and help me work on it.\". After a bit of digging\
      \ prospective team members find that the only thing that exists for the mod\
      \ is simply a website. If you've been there and done that, or, are thinking\
      \ about doing it then read <a href=\"/Legacy:Mychaeel/Mod_Startups\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Mychaeel/Mod Startups\">Mychaeel/Mod_Startups</a>. It will save you some\
      \ pain.</p>\n<p>Occasionally a mod will die before it's been started because\
      \ it is so ambitious. Most \"total conversions\" go this way. It's very easy\
      \ to come up with a mod idea where the actual amount of effort required to build\
      \ it is so daunting that the mod team goes into a type of paralysis. The mod\
      \ itself is so big that it's scary.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ Mods that die before publishing anything\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>I would say that the vast majority of mods involving\
      \ a team of two or more people fall into this category. Work on the mod starts\
      \ off well, but when the \"interesting\" work is completed the members of the\
      \ team lose interest and gradually drift away. Maintaining a tight focus when\
      \ all that is needed is polishing work on the user interface, the config, testing,\
      \ and bug fixing is difficult. This is made harder by the distributed nature\
      \ of most mod teams.</p>\n<p>Lack of organisation or even over organisation\
      \ can also kill a mod that has started well. It generally exhibits itself as\
      \ a gradual decline of interest and an increase in a poor attitude. Some team\
      \ leads try to be the focal point of all communication. This can help, but more\
      \ often than not prevents the team gelling properly.</p>\n<p>Interruptions from\
      \ \"real life\" and a decline in interest in the mod from team members also\
      \ kill mods before they publish. Loss of a key team member to real life problems\
      \ can be catastrophic for small teams, especially if the person dropping out\
      \ has become the central focus of the mod. If the mod is a reasonable size then\
      \ it's very easy to simply get sick of working on it. One the \"mod sickness\"\
      \ kicks in the only thing that will keep a team together and working on the\
      \ mod is stubborness, the desire to actually finish something, and an enthusiastic\
      \ beta-testing team.</p>\n<p>Some mods die because one particular member of\
      \ the team \"goes to the dark side\" and becomes increasingly negative and cynical\
      \ about the mod – or constantly attempts to further their own agenda over and\
      \ above everyone elses. Once that happens the whole team can be quickly sucked\
      \ into an increasing attitude of negativity. Unfortunately the only way to avoid\
      \ destruction in this way is to kick the \"bad apple\" from the team.</p>\n\
      <p>Making a sizeable mod is not for the faint hearted. There is always far more\
      \ work to do than it first appears. This in itself is a discouraging factor\
      \ that will cause mod teams to falter and stumble.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ to send ripples of amazement and interest throught the community. This is\
      \ all well and good (although over hyping your mod is a bad thing) but when\
      \ the community doesn't even bother to look at the mod web site (assuming there\
      \ is one) it can be very discouraging. This discouragement can in turn lead\
      \ to the mod team giving up on the mod and either finding something else to\
      \ do, or disbanding.</p>\n<p>There is an inherent risk with any mod idea that\
      \ it simply doesn't work when implemented. This might be because of a technology\
      \ limitation or simply an interface or implementation problem. Whatever the\
      \ reason is, some great ideas just don't translate well into code. When a team\
      \ finds themselves in this position it's very easy to point the finger at the\
      \ person who dreamt up the original idea and blame them. In fact, this is the\
      \ very worst thing you can do. These things happen - it's a fact of life. Rather\
      \ than sit around being glum, or destructing the team, brainstorm another idea\
      \ - or see if there is a solution to the issue you have. You've already got\
      \ some experience working together and you've managed to get further than most.</p>\n\
      <p>If a mod does't get a detailed specification or description fairly quickly\
      \ after its inception the odds are it will die shortly after. It could be that\
      \ the idea itself is not interesting enough for anyone to want to add detail\
      \ to it. Alternatively, the original idea could be so vague that it meant all\
      \ things to all people, sparking off long winded and destructive discussions\
