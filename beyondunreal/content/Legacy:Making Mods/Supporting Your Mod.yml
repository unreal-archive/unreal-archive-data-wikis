      \ In the months and years that follow the release of your mod to the general\
      \ public the sounds of the popping corks will be scant comfort as you scream\

      \ you have released your mod you might think that you could move onto something\
      \ else, but that’s not always the case. If the mod is a very simple mutator\
      \ then you might get lucky. However, for a mod of any complexity you will almost\
      \ receive a fair few e-mails requesting help, new features, and bug reports.</p>\n\
      <p>For a complex mod it’s not difficult to spend more time supporting it than\
      \ you did writing it. You may have only spent 6 months writing the mod, but\
      \ the game the mod is for may last for many years. IF you skimped on the bug\
      \ fixing and testing then this is the point at which it bites.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ number of support e-mails (or at least speeding up the processing of them)\
      \ is by maintaining an FAQ. Whenever you get a question not on the FAQ add the\
      \ question along with a detailed answer. Make sure the FAQ is referenced in\
      \ the read me, and the release notes. Publish the FAQ on the Internet on you\
      \ \"mod site\" if you have one. Keep a copy of the FAQ on your desktop so you\
      \ can simply drag and drop it into an e-mail as you answer the same question\
      \ for the 15th time.</p>\n<p>Always place a version number or last updated date\
      \ on the FAQ.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Future_versions\">Future\

      \ is whether or not there is on-going development for the mod. You can avoid\
      \ a lot of future feature requests simply by making it clear that there will\
      \ never be another version of the mod. However, if you do intend to continue\
      \ to extend the mod then add some sections to the bottom of the FAQ. These sections\
      \ should that list all of the features that have been requested so far in the\
      \ following categories – rejected, scheduled, and under consideration. This\
      \ should reduce the number of duplicate requests, but probably won’t.</p>\n\
