      \ you have the original brush (a little redundant but I forgot to clip it out\
      \ of the picture), the merged brush, the brush created using a clip, and the\
      \ brush created using the subtract. For both the clipped and subtracted brush\
      \ I used an intersected version of the brush to add them to the world. When\
      \ viewed in game, I got the following results:</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\
      0\" cellpadding=\"4\">\n<tr>\n<td>Brush type</td>\n<td>Nodes</td>\n<td>Polygons</td>\n\
      </tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Default extrusion</td>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\
      <td>Merged polys</td>\n<td>26</td>\n<td>11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clipped polys</td>\n\
      <td>23</td>\n<td>16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subtracted polys</td>\n<td>26</td>\n\
      <td>9</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>The implication of that is pretty interesting.\
      \ It seems that as the number of points on the extruded face increases subtracting\
      \ or clipping the face produces better results than simply merging the polys.\
      \ The most interesting thing about the above example though is that the very\
      \ best results would be achieved by merging the faces on the \"clipped\" brush.\
      \ For some reason the clipped brush produces a more efficient set of Faces.</p>\n\
      <p>Something else I just tried - Zoning the level I built (essentially a cross\
      \ roads with four large rooms to the north, south, east, and west). This changes\
      \ the node count which lends weight to my theory that the node count is the\
      \ total number of nodes within the BSP traversed rather than visible (which\
      \ makes more sense to me from a performance monitoring point of view as well).\
      \ Here's the post level zoning results</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"\
      0\" cellpadding=\"4\">\n<tr>\n<td>Brush type</td>\n<td>Nodes</td>\n<td>Polygons</td>\n\
      </tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Default extrusion</td>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\
      <td>Merged polys</td>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clipped polys</td>\n\
      <td>21</td>\n<td>16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subtracted polys</td>\n<td>21</td>\n\
      <td>9</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>I did cheat a little as I set the BSP \"minimise\
      \ cuts/balance tree\" weighting to 5 when I built the level.</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b>I\
      \ read all this and it doesn't even have a conclusion, This Channel sucks. Now\
      \ I'm gonna be bothered for weeks.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Well.... the conclusion\
      \ was, I think: \"It depends on the type of shape. Clip and intersect cuts may\
      \ have non-grid points, so that's an extra thing to watch for.\"</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ It's more of a journey than a destination&#160;:) – To be honest this topic\
      \ is somewhat moot now that everythings gone to static-mesh hell.</p>\n<p><b>SuicideMissions{CLR}:</b>\
      \ LOL. We know that the leaves of the BSP tree correspond to BSP Polys. If in\
      \ the phrase \"node:poly\" ratio, \"poly\" refers to BSP Polys, then how could\
      \ the ratio be anything other than 1:1? Therefore, *if* poly means BSP poly,\
      \ then node MUST mean all nodes traversed in the tree. This also does make sense\
      \ from a performance-stat point of view.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"\
