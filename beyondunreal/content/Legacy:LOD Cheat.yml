      <p>Right. So here's what a big city map could look like. (If you forgot to actually\
      \ add detail)</p>\n<p>[[Image:Legacy_lodcheat1.jpeg|]]</p>\n<p>Now, let's see\
      \ what our city would look like... Oh my gosh! Look at that. The n00b has made\
      \ some completely ridiculous <a href=\"/Legacy:Zone\" title=\"Legacy:Zone\"\
      >zones</a> in there!</p>\n<p>[[Image:Legacy_lodcheat2.jpeg|]]</p>\n<p>Well,\
      \ the green zone isn't in fact just any zone. It's the SkyBox. And it surrounds\
      \ the blue zone because the blue zone has fog in it that cuts off the view at\
      \ 2000 units.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Explanation\">Explanation</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:LOD_Cheat?section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Explanation\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>That\
      \ scene you see up there, was build by slapping some random blocks in a fairly\
      \ large room. Then, I duplicated the whole room and moved the second one 5000\
      \ UUs below the original. I then used <a href=\"/Legacy:Inio\" title=\"Legacy:Inio\"\
      >inio</a>'s <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:ScaledSkyZone?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"\
      Legacy:ScaledSkyZone (page does not exist)\">ScaledSkyZone</a> which I found\
      \ at <a href=\"/Legacy:MultiSkyBox\" title=\"Legacy:MultiSkyBox\">MultiSkyBox</a>\
      \ discussion, so that the Sky would move exactly as the player does, thus creating\
      \ an illusion that the skyzone is the same playing area that surrounds the player.</p>\n\
      <p>In order to properly hide the transition between the two zones, the actual\
      \ playing zone fades to black at 2000 units. Since the sky zone consists of\
      \ black textures, none will be any wiser. And just so that the buildings could\
      \ actually be seen from far away, I added a bit of blue <a href=\"/Legacy:Fog\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Fog\">fog</a> into the sky zone.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ the whole point?\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>Now, I'm not sure how much of use this will be, but I think that when used\
      \ properly, it will save a lot of FPS. You see, the buildings in the sky zone\
      \ are supposed to be very low detail. They don't need any detail because they're\
      \ quite far away. But since we basically only see 2000 units far, we can add\
      \ lots and lots of static meshes into the real world zone... all <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh\">static meshes</a> that are\
      \ too far away, simply aren't rendered.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"Bit_of_thoughts\">Bit of thoughts</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\
      ><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:LOD_Cheat?section=4\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Bit of thoughts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The buildings in the sky zone are currently normal\
      \ geometry with a black texture. I'm thinking static meshes would do the trick\
      \ better. Also, I'm thinking that instead of simple black textures, I should\
      \ add nice shiny yellow windows on the textures. Since the textures are unlit,\
      \ the black parts stay black, but the windows would shine nicely even from further\
      \ away.</p>\n<p>Hm. Apart from probably being more efficient buildings in the\
      \ SkyBox, static meshes would have another strength. If the SkyBox view goes\
      \ inside one of those buildings, you can see right out of it. If the buildings\
      \ are geometry, the whole sky view gets borked.</p>\n<p>The Sky view lags a\
      \ bit. If you go near a buildings corner, and move so that you see the corner\
      \ and the sky at the same time, you can see the corners of the underlying sky\
      \ building image. Basically this means that you probably should trim your buildings\
      \ with static meshes so they're a bit fatter than their low detail counterparts.</p>\n\
      <p>I stand corrected: Since SkyBoxes can see into other SkyBoxes, real sky with\
      \ stars and clouds and all beyond the cityscape is possible.</p>\n<p>The ScaledSkyZone\
      \ is not the same one as in the iono's zip file anymore. I actually didn't bother\
      \ trying to set its location just right, so I changed its code so it'd think\
      \ its starting location is (0,0,-5120). In fact, it would be better all around\
      \ if someone just made a new SkyZoneInfo that has an Offset attribute to begin\
      \ with. I certainly tried, but there must've been something in the properties\
      \ I missed. It just refused to move.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ I immediately realized its greatest flaw. The bright windows would pop in\

      \ have a really vast map, you could make the details disappear at such distance\
