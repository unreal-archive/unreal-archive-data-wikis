      \ class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Cartesian coordinate system\">Wikipedia:Cartesian\

      <p>The use of height can dramatically change the way a map flows, for good or\
      \ ill. Vast drops into chasms and lakes of lava will put people off those routes\
      \ (and possibly the map) especially if the <i>bridges</i> are easy to fall from.\
      \ Being able to drop into position directly behind someone from a ledge can\
      \ add an element of strategy and suprise to a map that would otherwise be missing.\
      \ The other thing adding the magic z dimension to your map can do is make it\
      \ appear much large than it actually is. Adding a level or two to a map can\
      \ increase the perceived size of the level without actually making the dimensions\
      \ of the map much larger. This means the action is not slowed down as much as\
      \ it would be if the map had simply been enlarged.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"\

      \ are some sections (slightly re-worded) taken from other parts of the wiki\

      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Z-Axis?section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Domination\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A good\
      \ Domination map should at least have two, but preferably three, different height\
      \ levels. For an example of good z-axis usage, check out <i>DOM-Olden</i>. The\
      \ map has a good, open structure with wooden beams at a lot of different levels.\
      \ It encourages the player to use his/her translocator more and it improves\
      \ gameplay a lot, because attacks can come from anywhere. <i>DOM-Gearbolt</i>\
      \ also has some suprising z-axis play due to the fixtures just below the roof\
      \ and the placement of the bridge.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Double Domination\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The use of the z-axis in Double Domination maps is\
      \ a much more controlled affair than in UT's Domination. Double Domination revolves\
      \ entirely around controlling two points for the given amount of time. This\
      \ means that z-axis use should primarily be used to aid control point defense.\
      \ Remember also that there is no translocator in Double Domination so players\
      \ will have to use map features (lifts, ramps, kickers) to travel between the\
      \ levels of the map.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Deathmatch\"\
      >Deathmatch</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Z-Axis?section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Deathmatch\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>When\
      \ building a good Deathmatch map the z-axis is an essential part of your flow.\
      \ Being able to go up and down easily allows more complex strategies to be adopted.\
      \ You can always make shortcuts the player can hammer jump to if they want.\
      \ Also, having to aim up or down in a fire fight is always fun. An example would\
      \ be <i>DM-Phobos</i>. You can <a href=\"/Legacy:HammerJump\" title=\"Legacy:HammerJump\"\
      >hammer jump</a> to the armor from the hallway below, or you can also hammer\
      \ jump up to the ledge from the area with pads/flak if the boots are gone. It's\
      \ all part of flow and adds an element of surprise to the game. You just don't\
      \ know where your opponent will pop up from. Also consider lift jumps. <i>DM-Deck16][</i>\
      \ is a good example of a useful lift jump for catching a player off guard. Deck16][\
      \ is also a great example of z-axis use. The multiple levels can make a level\
      \ feel very large and complex.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Capture_the_Flag\"\
      >Capture the Flag</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Z-Axis?section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Capture\
      \ the Flag\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Capture the Flag levels tend to be very sparing in their use of the z-axis.\
      \ Most maps seem to either ignore it, or force the player to choose between\
      \ a \"high\" route or a \"low\" route. There is generally very little traversal\
      \ between routes, and that which does occur is normally in a downwards direction.\
      \ <i>CTF-Dreary</i> is probably the map with the most z-axis use. Players can\
      \ leave the base via a high route (using a BSP collision bug in the map) or\
      \ through the middle platforms and then possibly drop down to the lower level.\
      \ Travelling back up to the highest level is not possible. Other maps that make\
      \ use of the z-axis are <i>CTF-Gauntlet</i>, and <i>CTF-Orbital</i>. It could\
      \ possibly be said that CTF maps don't make enough use of the z-axis, but given\
      \ the way the use of height can change a map flow this may be a good thing.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Assault\">Assault</span><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Assault\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Use of the z-axis in Assault maps is a tricky feat\
      \ to pull off. The Assault game type is purely objective based and it's hard\
      \ enough to build a level that doesn't compromise game play in two dimensions\
      \ let alone three. Some of the original Assault maps have z-axis routes, both\
      \ intentional and unintentional. In <i>AS-Overlord</i> you can <a href=\"/Legacy:HammerJump\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:HammerJump\">hammer jump</a> over the bunkers to avoid the\
      \ fox holes and mortar blasts. In <i>AS-Frigate</i> you can hammer jump up onto\
      \ the deck of the ship and attack from there. In <i>AS-Mazon</i> it is possible\
      \ to bypass the first objective and hammer jump right into the enemy base -\
      \ one example of a z-axis route that was never intended by the map author. Some\
      \ of the maps that come with the Eavy Assault Bonus Pack make good use of the\
      \ z-axis, and it is these maps that I would use as reference rather than the\
      \ Epic ones.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bombing_Run\">Bombing\
      \ Run</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Z-Axis?section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Bombing\
      \ Run\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Essentially a Bombing Run map involves a player running from their spawn\
      \ position to a single point on the map to collect the ball, and then on to\
      \ the other teams goal. A compass at the top of the screen indicates the direction\
      \ from the player to the ball at all times. Since the compass doesn't indicate\
      \ height, having the middle section of the bombing run map use many levels provides\
      \ the ball carrier with more ability to confuse and evade the opposing team.\
      \ Be wary of too much z-axis use on entry to the scoring areas within a Bombing\
      \ Run map. Multiple entrances are fine but it's worth making sure that the scoring\
      \ hoop can actually be defended. For example BR-Bifrost allows players to drop\
      \ down into the base from above. Also, Bifrost has that platform that you shoot\
      \ the ion painter to the ground. But, in order to score a goal you have to run\
      \ a short distance - there is no way of scoring from above the base. Having\
      \ said that, the Bombing Run maps shipped with UT2003 feel largely like flat\
      \ surfaces with occasional changes in height and have little z-axis work. It's\
      \ probably not a bad idea to always place the two scoring hoops at the same\
      \ heigth within the map.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Types_of_Transportation\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are a few ways of travelling between the different\
      \ levels of a map. Here's a list of the common ones.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Lift&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Remember that people can \"lift-jump\" to gain extra height to access areas\
      \ of the map that would otherwise be unreachable. If the lifts are too slow\
      \ you will break up the action far too much - this is especially important in\
      \ CTF maps. Lifts and use much less space than stairs or ramps. However, a player\
      \ can feel \"trapped\" while riding a lift or if they can't move off of it until\
      \ they reach the next point. Lifts require a player to stop and wait, which\
      \ can kill pace. (see Action, Keep Up the Pace) See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Lifts_Vs_Jumppads\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Lifts Vs Jumppads\">Lifts Vs Jumppads</a>. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Mover_Topics\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mover Topics\">Mover Topics</a>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Ladder&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Like lifts, ladders use much less space than stairs or ramps. Climbing a\
      \ ladder is often slow, so don't use it for long climbs, unless you want there\
      \ to be risk involved. Some Unreal Engine games don't support ladders natively,\
      \ so you would have to code them yourself. Ladders can be tricky to implement\
      \ at first. See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Add_A_Ladder\" title=\"Legacy:Add A Ladder\"\
      >Add A Ladder</a>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Jump Pad&#160;</dt>\n<dd>These bounce\
      \ the player in a specfied direction. Jump pads don't use much space. However,\
      \ they can take some experimentation to implement. It is not recommended to\
      \ use them for traversing longer distances, as this makes it very easy for players\
      \ to miss the intended target. See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Lifts_Vs_Jumppads\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Lifts Vs Jumppads\">Lifts Vs Jumppads</a>. These are made with:</dd>\n\

      <dt>Gravity Zone&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Players jump higer than normal. Dodges are\
      \ also much faster. Don't change gravity in your map without a good setting\
      \ or map \"rationale\". Otherwise it will look odd. This is a volume with special\
      \ gravity that moves players in a set direction. It acts similar to a Jump Pad,\
      \ except the velocity change players experience is much more gradual. See also\

      \ Zone&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Players can swim in these allowing them to move up and\
      \ down. See <a href=\"/Legacy:NitrogenZone\" title=\"Legacy:NitrogenZone\">NitrogenZone</a>.\
      \ Be aware that players in a Nitrogen zone look a little odd, and sometimes\
      \ don't replicate very well.</dd>\n<dt><a href=\"/Legacy:HammerJump\" title=\"\
      Legacy:HammerJump\">HammerJump</a>&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This stings a lot but is\
      \ an effective way of gaining a lot of height. The equivalent technique in UT2003\
      \ hurts much less and as such is more viable for map construction.</dd>\n<dt>Jump\
      \ Boots&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Providing one or two pairs of jump boots on a level\
      \ can give players the opportunity to escape pursuit by jumping up through the\
      \ levels of your map when they cannot be followed.</dd>\n<dt>Teleporters&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>This can be used for fast transportation from one area of the map to another.\
      \ This is an easy way for a player to travel from point A to point B although\
      \ it can momentarily disorient them, especially if your exit direction is facing\
      \ a wall or fall. However, if you have a dead end that you just can't seem to\
      \ physically connect to somewhere else, the teleporter can be a quick-fix solution.\
      \ Be careful so that telefragging and camping with these is difficult (compare\
      \ CTF-Face and CTF-Face-SE). See <a href=\"/Legacy:Teleporter\" title=\"Legacy:Teleporter\"\
      >Teleporter</a>, <a href=\"/Legacy:Teleportation_Basics\" title=\"Legacy:Teleportation\
      \ Basics\">Teleportation Basics</a> for more information.</dd>\n<dt>Warp Zones&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>A Warp Zone is a set of zones that act as a teleporter, to give the player\
      \ the effect of seeing straight though to the other zone, seamlessly. It requires\
      \ a lot of setup and has a few catches (like can't use within a zone with a\
      \ skybox), but it's doable. See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Warping\" title=\"Legacy:Warping\"\
      >Warping</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:WarpZoneInfo\" title=\"Legacy:WarpZoneInfo\"\
      >WarpZoneInfo</a> <i>(particularly \"Rachel's Tutorial\" link in the discussion)</i>.</dd>\n\
      <dt>Ramps and Stairs&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Having ramps or stairs that allow players\
      \ to move between the layers of your level is a very common way of gaining footing\
      \ on multiple levels. Generally ramps are preferred as although they are slightly\
      \ more tricky to build (and error collision prone) they keep the number of polygons\
      \ down. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Stairs\" title=\"Legacy:Making Stairs\"\
      >Making Stairs</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Ramps\" title=\"Legacy:Making\
      \ Ramps\">Making Ramps</a>. Staircases tend to be much easier to build, but\
      \ have many times the polys of a ramp. However, staircases often look nicer\
      \ when done right.</dd>\n<dt>Vehicles&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Flying or jumping vehicles\
      \ provide a very attractive means of vertical movement. Largely used in outdoor\
      \ situations, vehicles often become clear targets, but they move fast, are armed\
      \ well, and have built in armor. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Vehicle_Gameplay\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Vehicle Gameplay\">Vehicle Gameplay</a>.</dd>\n<dt>Translocators&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Although not a mapping element per se, translocators should be accounted\
      \ for when considering Z-Axis in Map Flow. The maximum height a standing player\
      \ can launch a translocator beacon in normal gravity is about 1536 units.</dd>\n\
      <dt>Falling&#160;</dt>\n<dd>It may seem obvious, but the Z-Axis includes paths\
      \ leading down a hole, off a ledge or out a window. Sometimes these are the\
      \ easiest and fastest means of escape. It can include a built-in risk by the\
      \ resulting damage of a long fall. After the fall, the space should include\
      \ some form of cover so it can be an effective escape.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3><span\

      \ They normally have a larger field of view and a clearer shot. Several weapons'\
      \ fire is based on gravity, making it harder for the opponent and easier for\

      \ against the floor. The players are generally standing on a platform or other\
      \ obstruction that serves as usable cover. They usually have the option to jump\
      \ down to their opponent if they want to chase or begin combat in closer quarters.\
      \ It normally takes longer for the opponent to charge up and meet the player.\

  wikitext:
    text: "'''Z-axis''' is one of the key elements to [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Map Design|Map Design]]. In mathematics, Z-axis is the vertical\
      \ axis in a [[Wikipedia:Cartesian coordinate system]] &ndash; in FPS games ,\
      \ it refers to the use of '''height'''.\n\nThe use of height can dramatically\
      \ change the way a map flows, for good or ill.  Vast drops into chasms and lakes\
      \ of lava will put people off those routes (and possibly the map) especially\
      \ if the ''bridges'' are easy to fall from.  Being able to drop into position\
      \ directly behind someone from a ledge can add an element of strategy and suprise\
      \ to a map that would otherwise be missing.  The other thing adding the magic\
      \ z dimension to your map can do is make it appear much large than it actually\
      \ is.  Adding a level or two to a map can increase the perceived size of the\
      \ level without actually making the dimensions of the map much larger.  This\
      \ means the action is not slowed down as much as it would be if the map had\
      \ simply been enlarged.\n\n==Gametype Sections ==\n\nHere are some sections\
      \ (slightly re-worded) taken from other parts of the wiki on map creation for\
      \ the various [[Legacy:Gametype|gametype]]s.\n\n===Domination ===\n\nA good\
      \ Domination map should at least have two, but preferably three, different height\
      \ levels.  For an example of good z-axis usage, check out ''DOM-Olden''.  The\
      \ map has a good, open structure with wooden beams at a lot of different levels.\
      \  It encourages the player to use his/her translocator more and it improves\
      \ gameplay a lot, because attacks can come from anywhere.  ''DOM-Gearbolt''\
      \ also has some suprising z-axis play due to the fixtures just below the roof\
      \ and the placement of the bridge.\n\n===Double Domination ===\n\nThe use of\
      \ the z-axis in Double Domination maps is a much more controlled affair than\
      \ in UT's Domination.  Double Domination revolves entirely around controlling\
      \ two points for the given amount of time.  This means that z-axis use should\
      \ primarily be used to aid control point defense.  Remember also that there\
      \ is no translocator in Double Domination so players will have to use map features\
      \ (lifts, ramps, kickers) to travel between the levels of the map.\n\n===Deathmatch\
      \ ===\n\nWhen building a good Deathmatch map the z-axis is an essential part\
      \ of your flow.  Being able to go up and down easily allows more complex strategies\
      \ to be adopted.  You can always make shortcuts the player can hammer jump to\
      \ if they want.  Also, having to aim up or down in a fire fight is always fun.\
      \  An example would be ''DM-Phobos''.  You can [[Legacy:HammerJump|hammer jump]]\
      \ to the armor from the hallway below, or you can also hammer jump up to the\
      \ ledge from the area with pads/flak if the boots are gone.  It's all part of\
      \ flow and adds an element of surprise to the game.  You just don't know where\
      \ your opponent will pop up from.  Also consider lift jumps.  ''DM-Deck16][''\
      \ is a good example of a useful lift jump for catching a player off guard. Deck16][\
      \ is also a great example of z-axis use. The multiple levels can make a level\
      \ feel very large and complex.\n\n===Capture the Flag ===\n\nCapture the Flag\
      \ levels tend to be very sparing in their use of the z-axis.  Most maps seem\
      \ to either ignore it, or force the player to choose between a \"high\" route\
      \ or a \"low\" route.  There is generally very little traversal between routes,\
      \ and that which does occur is normally in a downwards direction.  ''CTF-Dreary''\
      \ is probably the map with the most z-axis use.  Players can leave the base\
      \ via a high route (using a BSP collision bug in the map) or through the middle\
      \ platforms and then possibly drop down to the lower level.  Travelling back\
      \ up to the highest level is not possible.  Other maps that make use of the\
      \ z-axis are ''CTF-Gauntlet'', and ''CTF-Orbital''.  It could possibly be said\
      \ that CTF maps don't make enough use of the z-axis, but given the way the use\
      \ of height can change a map flow this may be a good thing.\n\n===Assault ===\n\
      \nUse of the z-axis in Assault maps is a tricky feat to pull off.  The Assault\
      \ game type is purely objective based and it's hard enough to build a level\
      \ that doesn't compromise game play in two dimensions let alone three.  Some\
      \ of the original Assault maps have z-axis routes, both intentional and unintentional.\
      \  In ''AS-Overlord'' you can [[Legacy:HammerJump|hammer jump]] over the bunkers\
      \ to avoid the fox holes and mortar blasts.  In ''AS-Frigate'' you can hammer\
      \ jump up onto the deck of the ship and attack from there.  In ''AS-Mazon''\
      \ it is possible to bypass the first objective and hammer jump right into the\
      \ enemy base - one example of a z-axis route that was never intended by the\
      \ map author.  Some of the maps that come with the Eavy Assault Bonus Pack make\
      \ good use of the z-axis, and it is these maps that I would use as reference\
      \ rather than the Epic ones.\n\n===Bombing Run ===\n\nEssentially a Bombing\
      \ Run map involves a player running from their spawn position to a single point\
      \ on the map to collect the ball, and then on to the other teams goal.  A compass\
      \ at the top of the screen indicates the direction from the player to the ball\
      \ at all times.  Since the compass doesn't indicate height, having the middle\
      \ section of the bombing run map use many levels provides the ball carrier with\
      \ more ability to confuse and evade the opposing team.  Be wary of too much\
      \ z-axis use on entry to the scoring areas within a Bombing Run map.  Multiple\
      \ entrances are fine but it's worth making sure that the scoring hoop can actually\
      \ be defended.  For example BR-Bifrost allows players to drop down into the\
      \ base from above. Also, Bifrost has that platform that you shoot the ion painter\
      \ to the ground.  But, in order to score a goal you have to run a short distance\
      \ - there is no way of scoring from above the base.  Having said that, the Bombing\
      \ Run maps shipped with UT2003 feel largely like flat surfaces with occasional\
      \ changes in height and have little z-axis work.  It's probably not a bad idea\
      \ to always place the two scoring hoops at the same heigth within the map.\n\
      \n==Types of Transportation ==\n\nThere are a few ways of travelling between\
      \ the different levels of a map.  Here's a list of the common ones.\n\n; Lift\
      \ : Remember that people can \"lift-jump\" to gain extra height to access areas\
      \ of the map that would otherwise be unreachable. If the lifts are too slow\
      \ you will break up the action far too much - this is especially important in\
      \ CTF maps. Lifts and use much less space than stairs or ramps.  However, a\
      \ player can feel \"trapped\" while riding a lift or  if they can't move off\
      \ of it until they reach the next point.  Lifts require a player to stop and\
      \ wait, which can kill pace. (see Action, Keep Up the Pace)  See also [[Legacy:Lifts\
      \ Vs Jumppads|Lifts Vs Jumppads]]. See [[Legacy:Mover Topics|Mover Topics]].\n\
      \n; Ladder : Like lifts, ladders use much less space than stairs or ramps. Climbing\
      \ a ladder is often slow, so don't use it for long climbs, unless you want there\
      \ to be risk involved. Some Unreal Engine games don't support ladders natively,\
      \ so you would have to code them yourself. Ladders can be tricky to implement\
      \ at first. See also [[Legacy:Add A Ladder|Add A Ladder]].\n\n; Jump Pad : These\
      \ bounce the player in a specfied direction. Jump pads don't use much space.\
      \  However, they can take some experimentation to implement.  It is not recommended\
      \ to use them for traversing longer distances, as this makes it very easy for\
      \ players to miss the intended target. See also [[Legacy:Lifts Vs Jumppads|Lifts\
      \ Vs Jumppads]]. These are made with:\n;* UT: [[Legacy:Kicker|Kicker]] and [[Legacy:Pathing\
      \ Kickers|Pathing Kickers]].\n;* UT2003: [[Legacy:UTJumpPad|UTJumpPad]]\n\n\
      ; Gravity Zone : Players jump higer than normal.  Dodges are also much faster.\
      \  Don't change gravity in your map without a good setting or map \"rationale\"\
      .  Otherwise it will look odd. This is a volume with special gravity that moves\
      \ players in a set direction.  It acts similar to a Jump Pad, except the velocity\
      \ change players experience is much more gradual.  See also [[Legacy:Gravity,\
      \ Warp Tunnels|Gravity, Warp Tunnels]]. See [[Legacy:Gravity, Warp Tunnels|Gravity,\
      \ Warp Tunnels]].\n; Nitrogen Zone : Players can swim in these allowing them\
      \ to move up and down. See [[Legacy:NitrogenZone|NitrogenZone]].  Be aware that\
      \ players in a Nitrogen zone look a little odd, and sometimes don't replicate\
      \ very well.\n; [[Legacy:HammerJump|HammerJump]] : This stings a lot but is\
      \ an effective way of gaining a lot of height.  The equivalent technique in\
      \ UT2003 hurts much less and as such is more viable for map construction.\n\
      ; Jump Boots : Providing one or two pairs of jump boots on a level can give\
      \ players the opportunity to escape pursuit by jumping up through the levels\
      \ of your map when they cannot be followed.\n; Teleporters : This can be used\
      \ for fast transportation from one area of the map to another. This is an easy\
      \ way for a player to travel from point A to point B although it can momentarily\
      \ disorient them, especially if your exit direction is facing a wall or fall.\
      \  However, if you have a dead end that you just can't seem to physically connect\
      \ to somewhere else, the teleporter can be a quick-fix solution.  Be careful\
      \ so that telefragging and camping with these is difficult (compare CTF-Face\
      \ and CTF-Face-SE). See  [[Legacy:Teleporter|Teleporter]], [[Legacy:Teleportation\
      \ Basics|Teleportation Basics]] for more information.\n; Warp Zones : A Warp\
      \ Zone is a set of zones that act as a teleporter, to give the player the effect\
      \ of seeing straight though to the other zone, seamlessly.  It requires a lot\
      \ of setup and has a few catches (like can't use within a zone with a skybox),\
      \ but it's doable.  See also  [[Legacy:Warping|Warping]] and [[Legacy:WarpZoneInfo|WarpZoneInfo]]\
      \ ''(particularly \"Rachel's Tutorial\" link in the discussion)''.\n; Ramps\
      \ and Stairs : Having ramps or stairs that allow players to move between the\
      \ layers of your level is a very common way of gaining footing on multiple levels.\
      \  Generally ramps are preferred as although they are slightly more tricky to\
      \ build (and error collision prone) they keep the number of polygons down. See\
      \ [[Legacy:Making Stairs|Making Stairs]] and [[Legacy:Making Ramps|Making Ramps]].\
      \ Staircases tend to be much easier to build, but have many times the polys\
      \ of a ramp. However, staircases often look nicer when done right.\n; Vehicles\
      \ : Flying or jumping vehicles provide a very attractive means of vertical movement.\
      \  Largely used in outdoor situations, vehicles often become clear targets,\
      \ but they move fast, are armed well, and have built in armor. See [[Legacy:Vehicle\
      \ Gameplay|Vehicle Gameplay]].\n; Translocators : Although not a mapping element\
      \ per se, translocators should be accounted for when considering Z-Axis in Map\
      \ Flow.  The maximum height a standing player can launch a translocator beacon\
      \ in normal gravity is about 1536 units.\n; Falling : It may seem obvious, but\
      \ the Z-Axis includes paths leading down a hole, off a ledge or out a window.\
      \  Sometimes these are the easiest and fastest means of escape.  It can include\
      \ a built-in risk by the resulting damage of a long fall.  After the fall, the\
      \ space should include some form of cover so it can be an effective escape.\n\
      \n===Vertical Combat===\n\n====Death from above====\n\nPlayers firing down on\
      \ their opponents enjoy several tactical advantages.  They normally have a larger\
      \ field of view and a clearer shot.  Several weapons' fire is based on gravity,\
      \ making it harder for the opponent and easier for the player.  They can use\
      \ impact, explosive and sticky shots to hit the opponent against the floor.\
      \  The players are generally standing on a platform or other obstruction that\
      \ serves as usable cover.  They usually have the option to jump down to their\
      \ opponent if they want to chase or begin combat in closer quarters.  It normally\
      \ takes longer for the opponent to charge up and meet the player.  These advantages\
      \ can add up to an imbalance if not managed using risk vs reward as a guide.\n\
      \n====Suprise attack====\n\nPlayers don't often look up or down without prompting.\
      \  An ambush is traditionally achieved by a quick ascent or descent to the enemy.\
      \  Snipers can enjoy watching the enemy before choosing the right time and target.\
      \  By allowing players to take their enemy by suprise you introduce more strategies\
      \ and tactics.\n\n====Vertical cover, dodging vertical fire====\n\nFire from\
      \ below can normally be blocked with the floor the player stands on.  However,\
      \ enemy fire from above can only be blocked by a structure set with proper collision,\
      \ such as platforms, beams, light fixtures, etc.  Dodging enemy fire from above\
      \ tends to be easier than dodging fire from below.  A player dodging fire from\
      \ below down will normally lose a line of sight to the opponent and might even\
      \ fall.\n\n===Vertical Search===\n\n====Keep it visible, usable space====\n\n\
      If you're going to use the Z-Axis, show it.  As much as opimization efforts\
      \ will allow, leave Z-Axis spaces open for search, navigation, and combat. \
      \ Players will enjoy the additional opportunities for varied tactics.  If players\
      \ can see through the floor or ceiling to other areas of the map, they can prepare\
      \ for an ambush, alert teammates, or give chase to opponents they see.\n\n====More\
      \ powerful items hidden above====\n\nIt is suggested above that a player normally\
      \ takes a longer time traveling upwards.  If an upper space or pathway is also\
      \ hidden or obscured, it may be worth holding a special powerful item like the\
      \ UDamage, to balance risk vs reward.  A completely hidden item is technically\
      \ a secret and requires strong clues and a considerable reward value for balance\n\
