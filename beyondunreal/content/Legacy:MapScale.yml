      <p>MapScale is an external tool that lets you scale a complete Unreal or Unreal\
      \ Tournament map. Yes, this tool will not only scale the brushes, it will also\
      \ make sure that the Lights, Triggers, Inventory items etc. stay at the right\
      \ positions. That means that you can make the whole map bigger or smaller without\
      \ bigger problems. It is much easier to use this utility than to do the conversion\
      \ by hand. The complete conversion process only takes a few minutes!</p>\n<h3><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_does_it_work.3F\">How does it work?</span><span\

      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:MapScale?section=3\" title=\"Edit section: How does it\
      \ work?\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Basically, the tool does not convert the map itself. At first, you will have\
      \ to export your map into <a href=\"/Legacy:T3D_File\" title=\"Legacy:T3D File\"\
      >T3D File</a> format. This format is also called Unreal Text, because it contains\
      \ all the information in a <a href=\"/Legacy:Map_File\" title=\"Legacy:Map File\"\
      >Map File</a>, but you can open it with a normal text editor like Notepad.</p>\n\
      <p>This file is then opened in MapScale. The program will analyze the file and\
      \ apply a specified scale factor at it.</p>\n<p>Additional features:</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>MapScale can also scale the <b>LightRadius</b> of the Light actors in your\
      \ map. That's important because the Light radii in your map would be too big\
      \ if you scaled the map down.</li>\n<li>It can scale the <b>CollisionRadius</b>\
      \ and/or <b>CollisionHeight</b> of triggerable actors, too. This will automatically\
      \ scale the <a href=\"/Legacy:Collision_Cylinder\" title=\"Legacy:Collision\
      \ Cylinder\">Collision Cylinder</a> of these actors in your map.</li>\n<li>It\
      \ can do <b>negative scaling</b>. This is very helpful when you want to create\
      \ a symmetrical <a href=\"/Legacy:Mapping_For_CTF\" title=\"Legacy:Mapping For\
      \ CTF\">CTF map</a> for example: Just build one side, scale it by -1 and add\
      \ it to the map - and your CTF map is almost finished!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span\
