      \ brush away. The Intersect tool can then be used to grab the final brush and\
      \ hey-presto you've removed a lot of unecessary polygons. This is similar to\
      \ the <a href=\"/Legacy:Merge_Polygons\" title=\"Legacy:Merge Polygons\">merge\

      \ shape to a larger number, then clipping the flat faces. This will remove the\
      \ triangulation though so it is a situational practice</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit\

      \ sides. If more than one side is selected, will split all.\n# Remove selected\
      \ side(s). Note that this tends to rearrange the remaining vertices quite a\
      \ bit, so it's best avoided if possible as a fair amount of fine tuning is necessary\
      \ afterwards. Not disastrous, but annoying.\n# Convert the current side to a\
      \ linear segment\n# Convert the current side to a Bezier segment\n# Process:\
      \ Sheet\n# Process: Revolve\n# Process: Extrude\n# Process: Extrude to point\n\
      # Process: Extrude to bevel\n\n===Mouse control ===\n* Click on points to select\
      \ them.\n* CTRL+Click to select multiple points\n* Click + drag to move points,\
      \ add CTRL to move multiple\n* Right-click + drag to pan the work area\n* CLick\
      \ and drag the orange centre point to move the entire shape\n\n==Processing\
      \ commands ==\n\n===Sheet ===\n\nThis simply creates a sheet brush out of the\
      \ current shape.\n\n===Revolve ===\n\nRevolves your 2D brush around the \"Y\"\
      \ axis.  The origin of the shape (the green node) must be completely to the\
      \ left or right of the shape you wish to revolve.  The distance of the origin\
      \ to the edge of your shape determines the inner radius the resultant shape.\
      \  The two properties you specify at the point of revolution are \"Per 360\"\
      \ which specifies the number of sides that would exist in a full circle, and\
      \ \"Use\" which specifies the number of sides to actually generate. \n\nTip:\
      \ rotate the shape before revolving to make, for example, a corridor that curves\
      \ upwards.\n\n===Extrude to set depth ===\n\nProduces a prism of a given depth,\
      \ with the current shape as cross-section.  It's well worth the effort of extruding\
      \ the brush slightly deeper than you need and then substracting (or clipping)\
      \ the \"flat\" faces of your extruded brush away.  The Intersect tool can then\
      \ be used to grab the final brush and hey-presto you've removed a lot of unecessary\
      \ polygons.  This is similar to the [[Legacy:Merge Polygons|merge polygons]]\
      \ command but also changes the brush wireframe potentially reducing the [[Legacy:Node\
      \ Count|Node Count]] of your brush.\n\n===Extrude to point ===\n\nProduces a\
      \ cone with the base of your 2D shape.  The height of the code is determined\
      \ by the depth value specified at the point of extrusion.  The X and Y offset\
      \ of the point of the cone is determined by the location of the 2D shape's origin\
      \ (that little green node you can see).\n\n===Extrude to bevel ===\n\nThis behaves\
      \ in a very similar manner to that of the \"Extrude to point\" function.  The\
      \ difference being that the resulting \"cone\" is trimmed down to the CapHeight\
      \ specified at the point of extrusion.\n\n==Tips ==\n\nSimplify the surfaces\
      \ of a brush produced with the 2D shape editor with the [[Legacy:Merge Polygons|merge\
      \ polygons]] command.\n\nTo get rid of extra polygons that it produces when\
      \ you add the brush, add it then [[Legacy:Intersect|intersect]] it. Delete the\
      \ added brush and add the RBB (Red Builder Brush) where you want to add it.\n\
      \nBe '''''VERY''''' careful creating the shape because there are no undo's;\
      \ save often.\n\n:'''Tarquin:'''  not necessarily a good thing though, may introduce\
      \ new BSP cuts. Use with caution on complex shapes.\n\nIf you are having problems\
      \ seeing the gridlines in the 2d Ed, then add this command to the end of your\
      \ UED shortcut:\n\n-no gamma-\n\nThis will make a fairly ugly workspace, but\
      \ you will get used to it and hey, you can see the grid lines...\n\nAlso you\
      \ can reduce polys per face by extruding the shape to a larger number, then\
      \ clipping the flat faces. This will remove the triangulation though so it is\
      \ a situational practice\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
