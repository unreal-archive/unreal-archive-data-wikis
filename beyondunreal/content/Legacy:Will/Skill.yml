      \ seems to be most peoples outlook on playing UT on public servers, which mainly\
      \ consists of 'if its spammy, its a n00b weapon', or for some people 'if you\
      \ kill me with it, its a n00b weapon and you're a n00b too', and this attitude\
      \ has been starting to annoy me for quite a while ...</p>\n<p>The most recent\
      \ thing (and half the trigger for this page) is to do with a discussion on the\
      \ gaming forums of my ISP (yes, my ISP hosts gameservers! neat, huh?), in which\
      \ it was being debated whether to re-enable the redeemer in the public servers.</p>\n\
      <p>After reading the thread thouroughly, I can see that many people do not want\
      \ it enabled, because it's 'skill-less'. Why are people so obsessed with this\
      \ all important skill? Why do people have to worry about whether their weapon\
      \ of choice is a 'n00b weapon' and people will bitch at them for using it, or\
      \ whether its a weapon that takes this 'skill' to use.</p>\n<p>And the fact\
      \ that enabling the deemer could 'scare off' some of the higher-level clan players\
      \ that occasioanlly go on the servers. So they're catering for the few '1337'\
      \ people, and leaving the 'n00bs' or the people who want to have fun out in\
      \ the dust?</p>\n<p>The deemer is called 'skill-less', but it seems whatever\
      \ weapon you use will be considered 'skill-less' by someone, mainly because\
      \ of the fact you killed them with it.</p>\n<p>Flak is 'skill-less', you just\
      \ spam it and hope it hits. <b>N00B!!</b></p>\n<p>The bio-rifle is 'skill-less',\
      \ you plaster it over the walls in the general direction of your opponent and\
      \ hope they die. <b>N00B!!</b></p>\n<p>The shock-combo is 'skill-less', because\
      \ you're a shock-whore. And for some reason that also makes you a '<i>N00B!!</i></p>\n\
      <p>Now those, and several other weapons in UT are considered 'n00b weapons',\
      \ mainly because you managed to kill the whiner with it. But of course if they\
      \ were using the weapon, it takes incredible skill to use, and is not a n00b\
      \ weapon at all!</p>\n<p>When I go on a public server, I go there for fun. I\
      \ dont go there for a serious match at all. If I wanted a 'proper' match, I'd\
      \ join a league, or play on a clan server, if not, I'll head over to a public\
      \ so I can have a laugh.</p>\n<p>WHY IS SKILL SO IMPORTANT?! WHY CANT YOU ALL\
      \ JUST PLAY FOR FUN?!</p>\n<p>The answer? \"f*ck off ang get skillz n00b\".</p>\n\

      \ without having to conform to their rules about which weapons to use, or you\

      \ its their attitude problem that irks me, not the fact that they moan.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Bickering about other players' style of playing in a game\
      \ is always lame, I agree. But if the discussion is whether to allow mass destruction\
      \ weapons like the Redeemer on a server or not, my point is valid. – I like\
      \ to use the Redeemer myself occasionally, but if its presence in a map forces\
      \ me to either adapt and constantly camp its respawn point myself or be fragged\
      \ by it all the time by a distinct other player who camps it, that takes away\
      \ <i>my</i> fun playing on that server. <i>My</i> reaction would be not to play\
      \ there, though.</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> In my mind, I think that the Sniper\
      \ Rifle's zoom is a noobish feature, also. The user's camp and hope for the\
      \ best.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Camping is the <i>idea</i> behind a sniper\
      \ rifle. Otherwise it's just a precision rifle. (Which it is, partly, in Unreal\
      \ Tournament. For one the rate of fire is too high. AvP2's sniper is much more\
      \ sniper-like in many respects.)</p>\n<p><b>Birelli:</b> I could easily make\
      \ my own rant on this topic, and I'm sure it would be very long, but I like\
      \ the way you said it here Will. Killing someone with a bio rifle can either\
      \ be the epitome of \"skill\" with a weapon or random luck. Either way it's\
      \ a carefully balanced weapon, which is not very effective as a spam tool (you\
      \ just step back, this isn't hard), or it's an extremely powerful precision-lob\
      \ weapon, much like the secondary fire of the flak cannon (if anything requiring\
      \ more \"skill\" than the flak cannon secondary because the higher rate of fire\
      \ and lower damage mean you have to hit the opponent with much more frequency\
      \ to make a kill than a single well-placed flak grenade).</p>\n<p>I also don't\
      \ buy the argument about the redeemer, a \"good\" player can avoid it fairly\
      \ easily on a large level where you can see it coming, and if you can hit someone\
      \ with it in close-quarters without getting killed in the blast you either have\
      \ great weapons-firing-dodging skills or great skill at guiding it through tight\
      \ spaces.</p>\n<p>Basically, the \"spam\" weapons of UT are ineffective against\
      \ true highly-skilled players, and every single one of them is very effective\
      \ if applied \"skillfully\". Another way of putting it is: the skill of the\
      \ player yielding the weapon has a lot more to do with it than the properties\
      \ of the weapon itself, which is I think part of what you are getting at Will.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Flak and Bio are so non-noob weapons. I can splat goo all\
      \ over the place, and still kill nobody except myself.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Yes, I can escape the Redeemer. Doing so, when I'm in the middle of a fire\
      \ fight, requires me to abort that fight. If I have to do that all the time,\
      \ it gradually takes away my joy of playing. The Redeemer is, alas, a weapon\
      \ you can effectively only run from.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> it's possible to\
      \ shoot a redeemer, but it has to be from a fair distance to avoid the explosion.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Technically it's possible (and the explosion is much smaller\
      \ if you manage it, more like a rocket explosion), but as the Redeemer is a\
      \ very small moving target and its actual collision cylinder doesn't correspond\
      \ with its visual appearance, I dismiss that possibility as \"practically irrelevant.\"\
      </p>\n<p><b>Ars-Magna:</b> What I hate is when the players who actually do have\
      \ sk1llz LOL at the n00bs and how much they suck. I play the game to have fun,\
      \ not because I'm good (I'm horrible). When I go on a public server where everyone\
      \ is nice and compliments the n00bs (me) on good shots, it makes my day a lot\
      \ nicer, and I actually have fun. Games where the l33t slaughter and then mock\
      \ everyone else are just plain not fun.</p>\n<p><b>Claw:</b> Heh, in UT2k3 the\
      \ Redeemer doesn't explode when shot down, and I think it's easier to do also.\
      \ Apart from that, I can only agree with Will. People should accept the game\
      \ \"as is\" or stay away from public servers.</p>\n<p><b>Dark Pulse:</b> I've\
      \ had very few people whine with me. Now, I'm no UT God, but I AM Very, Very\
      \ good, and I can kill with any weapon. (You should see some people's faces\
      \ when I just run around and Translocate into them.&#160;;)) If someone kills\
      \ me, I don't give a second thought about it, because a good player will not\
      \ waste time talking smack unless the kill was an especially satisfying one.\
      \ They'll be respawning ASAP, looking for Weapons/Armor/anything to not get\
      \ placed in 46 little bodybags. As for the Redeemer, I don't even bother shooting\
      \ it down. I just hide. You'd be amazed at how well a pillar will protect you\
      \ from a Redeemer explosion, provided you place yourself there carefully enough.\
      \ Sure, I still get stuffed sometimes, but more often then not I'll wait for\
      \ the shockwave to dissapate, then calmly step out and blow my opponent's head\
      \ off with a well placed Sniper Rifle shot. THEN I laugh. To put it short, a\
      \ weapon isn't cheap, no matter what anyone says. If someone keeps whining,\
      \ letthem whine, or if you're the Server Runner, consider kicking them if it's\
      \ repeated. All's fair in love and war, and if you're not good in the first\
      \ place, yes, you will leave the server with your ballbag in a sling. That means\
      \ you should practice more offline, and come back a bit later. I don't shy from\
      \ a map because it as a Megaweapon, or a Shieldbelt, or a UDamage. My Favorite\
      \ maps have at least one of those, and usually two or three. If you can't play\
      \ on a map just because of them, and stay away from those maps, then you're\
      \ really not playing the game at all, I figure.</p>\n<p>Mychaeel, I actually\
      \ don't camp with the sniper rifle. (Shocker, eh?) I do use it a lot, though,\
      \ simply because it's easy for getting Headshots. What easier, sure-fire way\
      \ is there to end a fight then to decap someone with your trusty Peace-Maker?&#160;;)\
      \ Now, I'm not saying I use it ALL the time - I switch weapons according to\
      \ the situation. But it's one of the ones that I'm bound to use regularly.</p>\n\
      <p>Ars, I agree with you there. Sure, it's great to be skilled, but if the person\
      \ is obviously weaker then you, don't gloat. Me and another guy I play (BASTARD)\
      \ Taunted and ridiculed each other so much that someone actually thought we\
      \ were bitter enemies. But we weren't - we were just two good players, playing\
      \ the Mindgame portion of the game, to each other.</p>\n<p>Sorry that this post\
      \ is so long... I just had a major opinion on how I feel.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>GHouck:</b>\
      \ I think a large part of what discourages many (like myself), is the fact that\
      \ we don't even care if were good or not, we just want to play the game and\
      \ have fun. I have a full-time job, a wife and a teen-age son, and I just don't\
      \ get to play as much as many others do, besides that my 35-year-old eyes and\
      \ reflexes are, well, 35 years old. What is wrong, is when one is alienated\
      \ from the online scene because they're not the best. I've seen people winning\
      \ by 40+ kills complain to the lowest scoring player that they \"took a cheap\
      \ shot\". As I said before, I, and many others, don't have the time to practice\
      \ enough to be the best at ANY game, but some act as if there's some great crime\
      \ in that. If I have free time to be on the 'puter, I'm mostly modding, and\
      \ although I'm not the greatest modder, I've made a few things (for ut2004)\
      \ that have gotten me compliments. I had just started learning to mod for HL2,\
      \ when some buttheads talked so much trash to myself and a couple friends in\
      \ a CSS game, we decided the HalfLife community was not worth modding for. I'm\
      \ not saying that we would have made the next Counterstrike, but I just wish\
      \ that people would understand that EVERYBODY has a place in the community if\
      \ they want it.</p>\n<p><b>Prospero:</b> The trick is to find servers with decent\
      \ admins who think like you do. Anytime people can annonymously wave their wangs\
      \ and pee on the carpet without any repercussions people will rise to the occasion.\
      \ Honestly I tend to play more CS than UT for that reason; there are a lot of\
      \ servers with very active admins who like to keep their carpet clean. The clean\
      \ carpets lure in players who also like dry socks, and communities of non-neanderthal\
      \ gamers form, which makes for an awesome gaming experience where skill doesn't\
      \ matter.</p>\n<p><b>GHouck:</b> That's very a true, simple, and direct way\
      \ of looking at it. I admit, that I don't have much patience when it comes to\
      \ things like this also. Also, I don't actually play enough to warrant spending\
      \ much time searching for a server that works well for me all around, especially\
      \ since I live in Alaska, so most servers give me fairly high pings. For now,\
      \ I'm content modding and botmatching mainly, with the occasional lan game.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b> I play online often enough, and I suck (visably\
      \ and obviously, to anyone I play with) However, I've had people calling me\
      \ a n00b maybe, twice. I am, to be sure. Maybe my regular server just caters\
      \ to friendly players, but I feel sort of adopted by it and those who frequent\
      \ it.</p>\n<p><b>sageriku:</b> It's interesting to see these \"l33t\" players\
      \ trash-talking other players, and then turn around and complain about weapons\
      \ that somehow threaten their seemingly all-powerful \"l33t\"-ness. Strategy\
      \ isn't about complaining about the opponents advantages. It's about avoiding\
      \ the strong and striking the weak. Calling a weapon a \"n00b\" weapon and trying\
      \ to ban it from existence certainly isn't adapting to the opponent. On the\
      \ other hand, beyond just playing the game, if a certain player has amassed\
      \ incredible skill with one weapon and wishes to create a monopoly by eliminating\
      \ all other weapons that would threaten their power, and they collected enough\
      \ public momentum to get those weapons eliminated, it would be quite strategic\
      \ in winning the game, but that's not the point of the game. The point is to\
      \ have fun, where skills are rewarded, but not given total power over the game\
      \ itself.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.041 seconds\n\

      \ weapons. I can splat goo all over the place, and still kill nobody except\
      \ myself.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Yes, I can escape the Redeemer.  Doing so, when\
      \ I'm in the middle of a fire fight, requires me to abort that fight.  If I\
      \ have to do that all the time, it gradually takes away my joy of playing. \
      \ The Redeemer is, alas, a weapon you can effectively only run from.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ it's possible to shoot a redeemer, but it has to be from a fair distance to\
      \ avoid the explosion.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Technically it's possible (and the\
      \ explosion is much smaller if you manage it, more like a rocket explosion),\
      \ but as the Redeemer is a very small moving target and its actual collision\
      \ cylinder doesn't correspond with its visual appearance, I dismiss that possibility\
      \ as \"practically irrelevant.\"\n\n'''Ars-Magna:''' What I hate is when the\
      \ players who actually do have sk1llz LOL at the n00bs and how much they suck.\
      \ I play the game to have fun, not because I'm good (I'm horrible). When I go\
      \ on a public server where everyone is nice and compliments the n00bs (me) on\
      \ good shots, it makes my day a lot nicer, and I actually have fun. Games where\
      \ the l33t slaughter and then mock everyone else are just plain not fun.\n\n\
      '''Claw:''' Heh, in UT2k3 the Redeemer doesn't explode when shot down, and I\
      \ think it's easier to do also. Apart from that, I can only agree with Will.\
      \ People should accept the game \"as is\" or stay away from public servers.\n\
      \n'''Dark Pulse:''' I've had very few people whine with me. Now, I'm no UT God,\
      \ but I AM Very, Very good, and I can kill with any weapon. (You should see\
      \ some people's faces when I just run around and Translocate into them. ;))\
      \ If someone kills me, I don't give a second thought about it, because a good\
      \ player will not waste time talking smack unless the kill was an especially\
      \ satisfying one. They'll be respawning ASAP, looking for Weapons/Armor/anything\
      \ to not get placed in 46 little bodybags. As for the Redeemer, I don't even\
      \ bother shooting it down. I just hide. You'd be amazed at how well a pillar\
      \ will protect you from a Redeemer explosion, provided you place yourself there\
      \ carefully enough. Sure, I still get stuffed sometimes, but more often then\
      \ not I'll wait for the shockwave to dissapate, then calmly step out and blow\
      \ my opponent's head off with a well placed Sniper Rifle shot. THEN I laugh.\
      \ To put it short, a weapon isn't cheap, no matter what anyone says. If someone\
      \ keeps whining, letthem whine, or if you're the Server Runner, consider kicking\
      \ them if it's repeated. All's fair in love and war, and if you're not good\
      \ in the first place, yes, you will leave the server with your ballbag in a\
      \ sling. That means you should practice more offline, and come back a bit later.\
      \ I don't shy from a map because it as a Megaweapon, or a Shieldbelt, or a UDamage.\
      \ My Favorite maps have at least one of those, and usually two or three. If\
      \ you can't play on a map just because of them, and stay away from those maps,\
      \ then you're really not playing the game at all, I figure.\n\nMychaeel, I actually\
      \ don't camp with the sniper rifle. (Shocker, eh?) I do use it a lot, though,\
      \ simply because it's easy for getting Headshots. What easier, sure-fire way\
      \ is there to end a fight then to decap someone with your trusty Peace-Maker?\
      \ ;) Now, I'm not saying I use it ALL the time - I switch weapons according\
      \ to the situation. But it's one of the ones that I'm bound to use regularly.\n\
      \nArs, I agree with you there. Sure, it's great to be skilled, but if the person\
      \ is obviously weaker then you, don't gloat. Me and another guy I play (BASTARD)\
      \ Taunted and ridiculed each other so much that someone actually thought we\
      \ were bitter enemies. But we weren't - we were just two good players, playing\
      \ the Mindgame portion of the game, to each other.\n\nSorry that this post is\
      \ so long... I just had a major opinion on how I feel. :)\n\n'''GHouck:''' I\
      \ think a large part of what discourages many (like myself), is the fact that\
      \ we don't even care if were good or not, we just want to play the game and\
      \ have fun. I have a full-time job, a wife and a teen-age son, and I just don't\
      \ get to play as much as many others do, besides that my 35-year-old eyes and\
      \ reflexes are, well, 35 years old. What is wrong, is when one is alienated\
      \ from the online scene because they're not the best. I've seen people winning\
      \ by 40+ kills complain to the lowest scoring player that they \"took a cheap\
      \ shot\". As I said before, I, and many others, don't have the time to practice\
      \ enough to be the best at ANY game, but some act as if there's some great crime\
      \ in that. If I have free time to be on the 'puter, I'm mostly modding, and\
      \ although I'm not the greatest modder, I've made a few things (for ut2004)\
      \ that have gotten me compliments. I had just started learning to mod for HL2,\
      \ when some buttheads talked so much trash to myself and a couple friends in\
      \ a CSS game, we decided the HalfLife community was not worth modding for. I'm\
      \ not saying that we would have made the next Counterstrike, but I just wish\
      \ that people would understand that EVERYBODY has a place in the community if\
      \ they want it. \n\n'''Prospero:''' The trick is to find servers with decent\
      \ admins who think like you do. Anytime people can annonymously wave their wangs\
      \ and pee on the carpet without any repercussions people will rise to the occasion.\
      \ Honestly I tend to play more CS than UT for that reason; there are a lot of\
      \ servers with very active admins who like to keep their carpet clean. The clean\
      \ carpets lure in players who also like dry socks, and communities of non-neanderthal\
      \ gamers form, which makes for an awesome gaming experience where skill doesn't\
      \ matter.\n\n'''GHouck:''' That's very a true, simple, and direct way of looking\
      \ at it. I admit, that I don't have much patience when it comes to things like\
      \ this also. Also, I don't actually play enough to warrant spending much time\
      \ searching for a server that works well for me all around, especially since\
      \ I live in Alaska, so most servers give me fairly high pings. For now, I'm\
      \ content modding and botmatching mainly, with the occasional lan game. \n\n\
      '''Bob_The_Beheader:''' I play online often enough, and I suck (visably and\
      \ obviously, to anyone I play with) However, I've had people calling me a n00b\
      \ maybe, twice. I am, to be sure. Maybe my regular server just caters to friendly\
      \ players, but I feel sort of adopted by it and those who frequent it.\n\n'''sageriku:'''\
      \ It's interesting to see these \"l33t\" players trash-talking other players,\
      \ and then turn around and complain about weapons that somehow threaten their\
      \ seemingly all-powerful \"l33t\"-ness.  Strategy isn't about complaining about\
      \ the opponents advantages.  It's about avoiding the strong and striking the\
      \ weak.  Calling a weapon a \"n00b\" weapon and trying to ban it from existence\
      \ certainly isn't adapting to the opponent.  On the other hand, beyond just\
      \ playing the game, if a certain player has amassed incredible skill with one\
      \ weapon and wishes to create a monopoly by eliminating all other weapons that\
      \ would threaten their power, and they collected enough public momentum to get\
      \ those weapons eliminated, it would be quite strategic in winning the game,\
      \ but that's not the point of the game.  The point is to have fun, where skills\
      \ are rewarded, but not given total power over the game itself.\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
