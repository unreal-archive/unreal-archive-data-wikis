      \ only in UT2003 and UT2004 and is the most demanding form of fog, resource\
      \ wise. The only advantage Emitter-based fog has over distance fog is that emitter-based\
      \ fog can move and creep about on your level. Emitter fog is created by simply\
      \ making an <a href=\"/Legacy:Emitter\" title=\"Legacy:Emitter\">Emitter</a>\
      \ with a very large range of locations for particles to be spawned. The particles\
      \ should be translucent, very slow moving, relatively large (for performance\
      \ reasons), and also should look somewhat foggy. This can take some experimentation\
      \ to get right, but fortunately, emitter fog can be seen in the 3D viewport\
      \ in the editor if <a href=\"/Legacy:Realtime_Preview\" title=\"Legacy:Realtime\

      \ fog is something like an extended corona. It behaves like distance fog, but\
      \ takes the shape of a sphere around a light source. I do not know if it is\
      \ availible in UT2003, but I would suspect that it is. In Unreal Tournament,\
      \ the radius of the spherical \"fog\" can be specified in the light's properties\
      \ by setting the VolumeBrightness, VolumeFog, and VolumeRadius properties in\
      \ the Lighting group. The fog will only be visible if the camera is within a\
