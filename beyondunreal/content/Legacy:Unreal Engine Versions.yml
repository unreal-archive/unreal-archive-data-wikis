      \ \"builds\" which may or may not contain certain features. Licensees eventually\
      \ stop merging builds from Epic, but often continue incrementing the build number\
      \ on their own (instead of the specific \"Licensee Version\" number), so occasionally\
      \ disparities arise, as you'll see with Unreal Tournament 2003. Also, with the\
      \ exception of America's Army, Epic's release of a game marks the first game\

      \ unclear. Theories vary: some think that this was merely the codename for the\
      \ Onslaught gametype implemented in UT2004, while others believe it's the original\
      \ code name for Gears of War. On a related note, Epic is adding a gametype to\
      \ UT3 that has been referred to as both \"Unreal Warfare\" and \"Conquest,\"\
      \ though Epic representatives have been quick to note that the final gametype\
      \ name is not set in stone.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Builds_versions_of_the_Unreal_Engine\"\
