      <ul>\n<li>Go to the page's <a href=\"/Help:Navigation#Page_Tabs\" title=\"Help:Navigation\"\
      >history</a> and click on the time and date of the earlier version you wish\

      \ the correct version, and click to edit the page, as you would normally. <b>Important:</b>\
      \ In the case of <a href=\"/Unreal_Wiki:Vandalism\" title=\"Unreal Wiki:Vandalism\"\
      >vandalism</a>, take the time to ensure you are actually reverting to the last\
      \ version without the vandalism; there may be multiple consecutive vandal edits,\
      \ sometimes interspersed with constructive edits.\n<dl>\n<dd>You will get a\
      \ warning, above the edit box, about editing an out-of-date revision. Since\
      \ this exactly what you want to do, you can ignore it.</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n\
      <li>Add an <a href=\"/Help:Editing_pages#Edit_summary\" title=\"Help:Editing\
      \ pages\">edit summary</a>, then save the page. Be sure to include the word\
      \ \"revert\" or \"rv\" in the summary. The summary should preferably also contain\
      \ the name of the user whose edit was reverted and that of the user whose version\
      \ was reverted to. A good example would be:\n<center><i>revert edits of [[User:BadGuy]]\
      \ to last version of [[User:GoodGuy]]</i></center>\nwhere <i>BadGuy</i> is replaced\
      \ with the IP address or username of the user whose edit is being reverted and\
      \ <i>GoodGuy</i> is the name or IP address of the user who saved the version\
      \ you are reverting to.</li>\n<li>When reverting blatant vandalism, you can\
      \ simply write \"rvv\" (short for \"revert vandalism\") in the edit summary,\
      \ because in those cases speed is usually more important that a precise edit\
      \ summary.</li>\n<li>Click on \"history\" again to verify that your revert was\
      \ successful. If your revert also affected legit edits, please edit those changes\
      \ again.</li>\n<li>In a vandalism case where sections of text were simply deleted\
      \ and then subsequent edits were made by others, it may be easier for you to\
      \ cut and paste those missing sections of text back in than to revert and then\
      \ re-do the edits.</li>\n<li>Check the contribution history of the user who\
      \ vandalized the article by clicking on the IP address for unregistered users\
      \ or on \"contribs\" on the history page. If the user is vandalizing many pages,\
      \ please report him or her on the <a href=\"/edit/Unreal_Wiki_talk:Vandalism?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Unreal Wiki talk:Vandalism (page does not exist)\">vandalism\

      <p>Latest versions of MediaWiki allow editors to revert a single edit from the\
      \ history of a page without simultaneously undoing all constructive changes\
      \ that have been made since. To do this, view the diff for the edit, and click\
      \ on 'undo' above the newer version. The software will attempt to create an\
      \ edit page with a version of the article in which the undesirable edit has\
      \ been removed but all later edits are retained. There is a default edit summary,\
      \ but it can be changed. It is also possible to make further modifications before\
      \ saving.</p>\n<p>This feature removes the need to manually redo useful changes\
      \ that were made after the edit which is being reverted. However, it will fail\
      \ if undoing the edit would conflict with later edits. For example, if edit\
      \ 1000 adds a paragraph and edit 1005 modifies that paragraph, it will be impossible\
      \ to automatically undo edit 1000. In this case, you must determine how to resolve\
      \ the problem manually.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rollback_.28advanced.29\"\

      <p><a href=\"/Unreal_Wiki:Administrators\" title=\"Unreal Wiki:Administrators\"\
      >Administrators</a> and users who have been granted access to the tool have\

      <li>work immediately, without intermediate confirmation diff page</li>\n<li>add\
      \ automatic <a href=\"/Help:Editing_pages#Edit_summary\" title=\"Help:Editing\
      \ pages\">edit summary</a> \"Reverted edits by Example (talk) to last version\
      \ by Example2\", marking edit as minor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rollback links appear\
      \ on the User contributions pages, History pages and Diff pages. Note that in\
      \ the last case rollback link can be misleading, since reversion is not necessarily\
      \ to the old version shown (the diff page may show the combined result of edits\
      \ including some by other editors, or only part of the edits the rollback button\
      \ would revert). To see the changes the rollback button will revert, view the\
      \ specific diff which compares the last version from the last editor with the\
      \ last version from the previous editor.</p>\n<p>Rollback works much quicker\
      \ than undo, since it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>allows reverting without even looking at\
      \ the list of revisions or a diff</li>\n<li>does not require loading an edit\
      \ page and sending the wikitext back to the server.</li>\n<li>does not require\
      \ a click of the save button.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, it is not as\
      \ versatile as undo, since it does not allow to specify which edits have to\
      \ be undone (one may want to revert more or fewer edits than rollback does,\
      \ or edits which do not include the last edit) and does not allow adding an\
      \ explanation to the automatic edit summary.</p>\n<p>Rollback is supposed to\
      \ be used to revert obvious vandalism.</p>\n<p>Rolling back a good-faith edit\
      \ without explanation may be misinterpreted as \"I think your edit was no better\
      \ than vandalism and reverting it doesn't need an explanation.\" Some editors\
      \ are sensitive to such perceived slights; if you use the rollback feature other\
      \ than for vandalism (for example because undo is impractical due to the large\
      \ page size), it's polite to leave an explanation on the article talk page or\
      \ on the talk page of the user whose edit(s) you reverted.</p>\n<p>If someone\
      \ else edited or rolled back the page before you clicked \"rollback\" link,\
      \ or if there was no previous editor, you will get an error message.</p>\n\n\
