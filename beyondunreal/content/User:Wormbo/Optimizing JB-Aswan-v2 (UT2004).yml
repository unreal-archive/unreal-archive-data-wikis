      \ a proper zoning layout. Ideally the map doesn't have long lines of sight,\
      \ but sometimes you don't really have a choice. In these cases it is important\
      \ to make portal sheets between zones as small as possible, while still retaining\
      \ a convex shape. Most importantly, zone portals do not need to overlap BSP\
      \ geometry. It is enough if they fit the opening perfectly, and in fact, making\
      \ them any larger is suboptimal for performance.</p>\n<p>On Aswan this especially\
      \ goes for the lower corridors from the side to the back rooms and for the exits\
      \ of the side rooms. These originally used just square portal sheets that were\
      \ quite a bit larger than the actually visible shape. An optimized shape would\
      \ be a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isosceles_trapezoid\" class=\"\
      extiw\" title=\"wp:isosceles trapezoid\">isosceles trapezoid</a> in both cases.</p>\n\
      <p>Another zoning consideration is whether to place just one portal in a small\
      \ corridor or actually make the corridor a separate zone by using two portals.\
      \ I decided to make the front entrances to the back rooms separate zones because\
      \ there's enough chance that the second portal isn't visible from the first\
      \ when viewing from an angle. If the portals were closer together this wouldn't\
      \ happen often enough, and if only a small part of a portal sheet is visible,\
      \ the entire portal is considered visible.</p>\n<p>Other parts that got their\
      \ own zones are the area below the upper walkway right outside the back rooms,\
      \ the ramps between the back rooms and the lower corridors, and the top part\
      \ of the back rooms which isn't visible from the outside. Those complex lightbox\
      \ meshes in the back rooms are quite a performance hit, so best effort must\
      \ be made to prevent them from being rendered if they aren't actually visible.</p>\n\

      \ Now check the view through your zone portals. In this step you try to identify\
      \ pairs of zones which are not actually visible from each other, yet the engine\
      \ decides to render them.</p>\n<p>For Aswan this is the case for the lower corridors\
      \ from the side to the back rooms. They definitely aren't visible from each\
      \ other, but because BSP doesn't occlude visibility, the zone portals \"see\"\
      \ each other. This could probably be fixed with anti portals, but it is much\
      \ cheaper and almost as efficient to just manually tell the engine that the\
      \ zones aren't visible from each other by using <a href=\"/edit/Manual_excludes?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Manual excludes (page does not exist)\">manual excludes</a>.\
      \ (ZoneInfo property <a href=\"/UE2:ZoneInfo_(UT2004)#ManualExcludes\" title=\"\
      UE2:ZoneInfo (UT2004)\">ManualExcludes</a>) For example, the red flak cannon\
      \ corridor and the blue rocket launcher corridor are set as manual excludes\
      \ for each other. It turned out that the engine also considers the red jail\
      \ to be visible from either of those corridors, so the red jail zone is also\
      \ added to the corridors' manual excludes.</p>\n<p>Other manual excludes are\
      \ the lower front entrance areas, which aren't visible from each other because\
      \ the Double Damage pedestal in the middle blocks the view. The engine still\
      \ renders them because their front portals are in the same zone.</p>\n<p>If\
      \ a zone doesn't have any zone portals or fake backdrop surfaces, it should\
      \ be flagged as lonely zone. (ZoneInfo property <a href=\"/UE2:ZoneInfo_(UT2004)#bLonelyZone\"\
      \ title=\"UE2:ZoneInfo (UT2004)\">bLonelyZone</a>) This allows the engine to\
      \ skip any considerations about rendering the zone when it renders other zones\
      \ and about rendering other zones when it renders this zone. JB-Aswan-v2 uses\
      \ this for the arena zone, because it is entirely separate.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ the lightbox meshes in the back rooms and some of the pillars on the front\
      \ wall of the bases. For these large actors it makes sense to match their <a\
      \ href=\"/UE2:Actor_properties_(UT2004)#ForcedFisibilityZoneTag\" title=\"UE2:Actor\
      \ properties (UT2004)\">ForcedFisibilityZoneTag</a> with the ZoneInfo Tag of\
      \ the zones the actor really is contained in. For the lightboxes this is the\
      \ red/blue backroom zone, and for the pillars it's the \"outside\", i.e. the\
      \ outside zone and the front entrance zones. Similarly, the fluid surfaces are\
      \ set to use their corresponding corridor as visibility zone.</p>\n<h2><span\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The final step of optimization is placing <a href=\"\
      /Anti_portals\" title=\"Anti portals\">anti portals</a>. Good locations for\
      \ these are e.g. large pillars that block much of the player's view. Anti portals\
      \ should always have a simple shape, yet fill out as much space as possible\
      \ because they are only considered separately for visibility occlusion.</p>\n\
      <p>On Aswan, the front row of pillars in front of the bases use six-sided cylinders\
      \ as anti portals, the blocks between the jail bars contain upside-down four-sided\
      \ pyramid shapes, the middle one cut off because it would reach into the escape\
      \ tunnel. The entire wall with the escape tunnel door contains a large anti\
      \ portal sheet that is tied to the escape door mover, the side walls of the\
      \ middle area contain sheet anti portals, and finally the Double Damage pedestal\
      \ contains an eight-sided cylinder anti portal. Additionally, some BSP surfaces\
      \ are marked as anti portals, for example the upper walkway in front of the\
      \ bases, which occlude the portals to the lower entrance areas.</p>\n\n<!--\
