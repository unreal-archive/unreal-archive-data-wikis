      \ a point behind the source for the sidebar being at the bottom – that it's\

      <p><b>GRAF!K:</b> I'm not sure about Offline Wiki being on the home as \"site\

      \ You can either change to a different skin in your sire preferences, or download\
      \ Mozilla (it's free!)\n\n'''GRAF!K:''' Download Mozilla at http://www.mozilla.org.\n\
      \n'''I noticed the HTML source for the sidebar is at the end of the document.\
      \ If moved to the top, would this fix the problem?'''\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' There's\
      \ a point behind the source for the sidebar being at the bottom &ndash; that\
      \ it's loaded last as well, after the more important content &ndash;, so putting\
      \ it at the top of the source would defeat that purpose completely.\n\n----\n\
      \n'''GRAF!K:''' I'm not sure about Offline Wiki being on the home as \"site\
      \ news.\" Offline Wiki has been going for quite a while now, and it looks kind\
      \ of odd as the '''only''' item in Site News. Perhaps we could just delete that\
      \ and leave the anouncement under the boldface offline reader warning. I'll\
      \ try something like that on [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Changes]].\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' You have a point.  I've removed the entire \"News\" section\
      \ for now &ndash; news only make sense if they're kept fresh.\n\n'''GRAF!K:'''\
      \ Thank you, Mychaeel. Sorry if I sounded rude. :-/\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Good point.\
      \ I only put the news section in for people who arrive from BU hosted site news.\
      \ But now there's a link to [[Legacy:Featured Pages|Featured Pages]], which\
      \ isn't locked, so anyone can post about new pages there.\n\n----\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ The styles stopped working all of a sudden at about.. the time of this message.\
      \ :P A few minutes ago all styles on the wiki ceased to function. I don't know\
      \ if it is just me, though.. did anyone else experience this or is something\
      \ up with my browser?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' The forums don't work either, and neither\
      \ do other hosted sites such as http://www.planetjailbreak.com.  That happened\
      \ yesterday morning already.  It's not related specifically to the Unreal Wiki.\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' Oh. It didn't appear to affect me until the time that I posted\
      \ that message. Styles appear to be working again though now.\n\n----\n\n'''empty_other:'''\
      \ A new \"editor\" here, so doesnt know where to start right now...But for the\
      \ moment its only ONE thing i would have wanted on this Wiki. I noticed your\
      \ name was UNREAL Wiki and not UnrealEd Wiki. And i come to think, what im looking\
      \ for is some \"Unreal Universe\" history (for those not noticed: Mostly of\
      \ the characters in UT99 have backgroundstories, many of them okey enough to\
      \ get an idea about another outside universe, outside the tournament). Three\
      \ pages who need to be made: General Timeline, Races and Famous/important characters.\
      \ Just working on the idea now, but if anybody has a good reason i should not\
      \ do it, say so...Or else, help me make it.\n\n----\n\n==Favicon==\n\n'''Zxanphorian:'''\
      \ I have made a favicon for the wiki. Here it is (you will have to convert it\
      \ to an .ico file, btw): <nowiki>-[DELETED]-</nowiki>\n\n'''Pingz:''' Upload\
      \ .PNGs ( jpg compression sucks ) at 48x48, 32x32, and 16x16.  You need the\
      \ different sizes if you want them to look good on a windows machine.  I'll\
      \ then convert them into a .png and .ico for use in Mozilla and IE.  Even then\
      \ realize that favicons are buggy in IE... they don't always show up.\n\n'''Zxanphorian:'''\
      \ The favicons work for me in IE. The [http://www.howstuffworks.com HowStuffWorks]\
      \ favicon is a black and white picture of a person's head opened with a world\
      \ in it, for example. Sure, i will upload in PNG's at those resolutions. (You\
      \ have to bookmark/favorite the page or put it in the links bar to see the favicon.)\
      \ Also, the admins (tarq and mych) have to upload the icon for it to work.\n\
      \n'''Zxanphorian:''' Here they are (i included the master copy if you don't\
      \ like the resizing) : [[Image:Legacy_faviconmaster.png|]] @inline@favicon48\
      \ @inline@favicon32 @inline@favicon16\n\n'''Pingz:''' Ok i merged the 3 sizes\
      \ into a single .ico file for windows which can be downloaded [http://www.pingz.com/files/wiki_favicon_48_32_16.ico\
      \ here].  All that is needed is for an admin to upload the favicon.ico and favicon.png\
      \ ( should be the 16x16 one ).\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Alright &ndash; I've uploaded\
      \ wiki_favicon_48_32_16.ico (as favicon.ico) and favicon16 (as favicon.png).\
      \  Please check whether it works as supposed.  Good work.  :-)\n\n'''Pingz:'''\
      \ Seems to work for both IE6 and Mozilla over here.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Seems\
      \ OK for IE5.\n\n'''Zxanphorian:''' Works in IE6. pingz, what is a good icon\
      \ maker?\n:'''GRAF1K:''' Visual Studio .NET and Visual Studio 6 have icon tools,\
      \ but being a gamer rather than webapp developer, you probably don't have access\
      \ to those. I dont know any others.\n\n'''RDGDanClark:''' The Favicon is supposed\
      \ to happen automatically, right? It's not showing up for me, I'm a Mozilla\
      \ user. Maybe I'm missing something...\n\n'''Zxanphorian (Not logged in):'''\
      \ Well, you have to bookmark it first :)\n\n'''Mosquito:''' CSS sheets seem\
      \ to be busted across the board. :S\n\n'''Wormbo:''' BeyondUnreal is having\
      \ problems ATM.\n\n'''CH3Z:''' I hope someone has all the wiki's graphics backed\
      \ up. But how do you ever notice when someone overwrites one they shouldn't\
      \ have, in time revert it before you overwrite the original with your next backup?\
      \ Ayway, just bringing this up after noticing that someone had overwritten \"\
      favicon\" on this page with that car pic. \n\n----\n\n'''TroyEB:''' Here is\
      \ a very good and complete UnrealScript doc page that should be linked http://unreal.student.utwente.nl/uncodex-ut2004/\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' It is &ndash; linked from [[Legacy:UnCodeX|UnCodeX]].\n\n\
      ----\n\n'''zugy:''' The search is looking really wierd...\n\n[http://img61.imageshack.us/img61/3700/thatdoesntlookright3by.jpg]\n\
      \nNot sure what's causing it...I'm using IE 6.0 (and no, I don't feel like using\
      \ firefox thank you very much :p) Windows XP SP2....\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I see\
      \ the same thing on Firefox. \n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Hmm. Guess I'll have to adapt\
      \ the Google result page parser a bit."
