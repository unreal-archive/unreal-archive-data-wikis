      \ AI code that drives bots doesn't have the power to interpret the 3D maps we\

      \ to make a network which the bots follow.</p>\n<p>These waypoints are mostly\

      \ of places that are safe and easy to travel. These nodes make up the bulk of\
      \ most bot path networks. Other types allow bots to tackle more complex things,\
      \ such as lifts, jumping, translocating and camping.</p>\n<p>Unless specifically\
      \ told so, bots assume they can simply walk, run or jump through the entire\

      \ your map. It is <b>highly</b> recommended that you do the pathing manually.</p>\n\
      <p>There are actually three <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Console\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\

      </pre>\n<p>Also, <a href=\"/Legacy:PathLogic\" title=\"Legacy:PathLogic\">PathLogic</a>\
      \ is a third-party application that lets you build the path network from within\

      <p>In UnrealEd 3, use Show Paths to troubleshoot the network after re-building\

      \ Caption Context Menu\">Viewport Caption Context Menu</a> -&gt; View -&gt;\

      <dd>A nice, wide path for the bots to follow. The bots will have no trouble\

      \ title=\"Legacy:Pathing For Vehicles\">Pathing for Vehicles</a>.</dd>\n<dt>Green</dt>\n\
      <dd>Not as good as a white path, but still a perfectly good path. Bots prefer\
      \ white paths but generally there are other factors that influence their decision\
      \ so this is not as big of an issue.</dd>\n<dt>Blue</dt>\n<dd>This path is technically\
      \ a good path, but is quite narrow. Bots will prefer a green or white path but\
      \ will attempt to take this one if it is the only path available.</dd>\n<dt>Purple</dt>\n\
      <dd>Purple paths designate jumpspots, lifts, teleporters, etc. They have their\
      \ own UnrealScript to define how bots feel about this type of path. If paths\

      \ when launched from the jumppad. When paths are shown this pink line will disappear.</dd>\n\

      \ never be used by bots. However, that is not to say that a bot will not end\
      \ up at the other pathnode as a result of being hit, etc. and may continue along\
      \ the path by \"skipping\" over the proscribed path. A path must be specifically\

      \ allows a player inside to move up and down instead of forward and back. Bots\
      \ need to be told where to enter and exit the ladder volume. This is done with\
      \ Ladder actors. See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Add_A_Ladder\" title=\"Legacy:Add\
      \ A Ladder\">Add A Ladder</a>.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"JumpPads\"\

      <p>JumpPads are nodes that throw players and bots through the air to a destination\
      \ node, like an ordinary PathNode. Bots know what that destination node is by\
      \ the ForcedPath described in the UTJumpPad actor. See also <a href=\"/Legacy:UTJumpPad\"\

      \ The Door actor can also tell bots to ingore the path through the door if it\

    text: "This is the [[Legacy:Bot Support|Bot Support]] system that allows bots\
      \ to run around a map via a network of waypoints, or '''bot paths'''.  This\
      \ page describes the concepts and elements of bot path networks.  For a simple\
      \ tutorial, see [[Legacy:Basic Bot Pathing|Basic Bot Pathing]].\n\n'''If you\
      \ are new to bot pathing''', see the [[Legacy:Basic Bot Pathing|Basic Bot Pathing]]\
      \ tutorial.   After that, [[Legacy:Testing Botplay|Testing Botplay]] will help\
      \ clean up any problem areas in the bot path.  When problems arise, see [[Legacy:Bot\
      \ Mind|Bot Mind]] because understanding the bot's behavior can help.  For special\
      \ tasks you'd like bots to do, try [[Legacy:Strategic Bots|Strategic Bots]]\
      \ or reviewing the list of available [[Legacy:NavigationPoint|NavigationPoint]]s\
      \ for options that handle bot support.\n\n==Overview ==\n\nThe AI code that\
      \ drives bots doesn't have the power to interpret the 3D maps we see them in.\
      \  Instead, a map has to have a set of waypoints, joined together to make a\
      \ network which the bots follow. \n\nThese waypoints are mostly actors of the\
      \ class [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]] >> [[Legacy:NavigationPoint|NavigationPoint]]\
      \ >> [[Legacy:PathNode|PathNode]]. PathNodes are special actors specifically\
      \ designed to tell bots of places that are safe and easy to travel.  These nodes\
      \ make up the bulk of most bot path networks. Other types allow bots to tackle\
      \ more complex things, such as lifts, jumping, translocating and camping. \n\
      \nUnless specifically told so, bots assume they can simply walk, run or jump\
      \ through the entire bot path network.  Simple obstacles like doors, lifts and\
      \ ladders pose problems for bots and require special nodes to help them navigate\
      \ as players do.\n\n===A Quick Note About Automatically Building The Path Network===\n\
      \n'''''NOTE:''''' It is the UnrealEd community consensus that use of '''any'''\
      \ of these automatic pathnode network generators creates an inferior Bot Navigation\
      \ system for your map. It is '''highly''' recommended that you do the pathing\
      \ manually.\n\nThere are actually three [[Legacy:UnrealEd Console|UnrealEd Console]]\
      \ commands that will automatically build a botpath network for your map:\n\n\
      \ ''PATHS BUILD''  auto create pathnode network - opt=1\n ''PATHS BUILD HIGHOPT''\
      \ auto create pathnode network - opt=2            \n ''PATHS BUILD LOWOPT''\
      \ auto create pathnode network - opt=0\n\nAlso, [[Legacy:PathLogic|PathLogic]]\
      \ is a third-party application that lets you build the path network from within\
      \ the game: you walk around your map, dropping path nodes as you go.\n\n==Seeing\
      \ The Network ==\n\nIn UnrealEd 3, use Show Paths to troubleshoot the network\
      \ after re-building paths. Do [[Legacy:Viewport Caption Context Menu|Viewport\
      \ Caption Context Menu]] ->  View -> Show Paths.  It's possible to hide everything\
      \ except the paths, which can be quite handy. Once the paths are visible, hit\
      \ '''Q''' to hide the [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]], and the 3D viewport shows just the\
      \ network (see [[Legacy:Hiding Actors|Hiding Actors]] for more on this). This\
      \ is basically your map as a bot sees it: just a network. \n\nWhile running\
      \ a game, you can see the paths a bot is considering (the route it is attempting)\
      \ when you use <tt>showdebug</tt>, one of the [[Legacy:Console Commands|Console\
      \ Commands]] for UT200x.  This will also show a lot of other information pertaining\
      \ to the bot's weapon, pawn, controller status, etc.\n\nYou should see a bunch\
      \ of  lines connecting the pathnodes. They are color coded depending on their\
      \ nature:\n\n===UT200x Color Codes===\n\nThe color of the line between path\
      \ nodes indicates to bots the general width of the path and therefore the ease\
      \ with which to use it.\n; White:  A nice, wide path for the bots to follow.\
      \ The bots will have no trouble following this path, seeing this as the most\
      \ availble route to take.  Bots will also see these paths as traversable by\
      \ vehicles. See [[Legacy:Pathing For Vehicles|Pathing for Vehicles]].\n; Green:\
      \ Not as good as a white path, but still a perfectly good path. Bots prefer\
      \ white paths but generally there are other factors that influence their decision\
      \ so this is not as big of an issue.\n; Blue: This path is technically a good\
      \ path, but is quite narrow. Bots will prefer a green or white path but will\
      \ attempt to take this one if it is the only path available.\n; Purple: Purple\
      \ paths designate jumpspots, lifts, teleporters, etc. They have their own UnrealScript\
      \ to define how bots feel about this type of path. If paths are not shown, a\
      \ pink arc will show the expected path that a pawn will take when launched from\
      \ the jumppad. When paths are shown this pink line will disappear.\n; Light\
      \ Purple: A path that takes the bot up or down a ladder.\n; Yellow: A forced\
      \ path. Used to tell bots that this path is available when the editor doesn't\
      \ automatically connect two nodes. A path must be specifically set as forced\
      \ in the pathnode properties.\n; Red: A proscribed path. The pathnodes joined\
      \ by this line, while technically connected, should never be used by bots. However,\
      \ that is not to say that a bot will not end up at the other pathnode as a result\
      \ of being hit, etc. and may continue along the path by \"skipping\" over the\
      \ proscribed path. A path must be specifically set as proscibed in the pathnode\
      \ properties.\n\n===UT Color Codes===\n\nIn UT, there is only two colors of\
      \ path - good ones and bad ones. Blue paths are good paths that the bots should\
      \ have no trouble with. Red paths are not very good paths but the bot will attempt\
      \ them anyway if it has no blue paths to take.\n\n==Special Navigation Points==\n\
      \n===JumpSpots===\n\nJumpSpots are nodes that tell bots of good landing spots,\
      \ good jumping '''destinations'''.  They include information telling the bots\
      \ whether the destination requires DoubleJumping, ImpactJumping or LiftJumping\
      \ to reach it.  They are also used to indicate good spots to translocate to.\
      \  See also [[Legacy:JumpSpot|JumpSpot]].\n\n===AssaultPaths===\n\nThese nodes\
      \ are used to indicate a good route to attack the enemy.  They not only add\
      \ nodes to the bot path network, they label particular routes and are used give\
      \ them a path weight that indicates to a bot how \"good\" the route is.  Assault\
      \ paths can also be used in games that require back and forth movement from\
      \ one base to the other, as in CTF, to tell bots of better return routes.  See\
      \ also [[Legacy:AssaultPath|AssaultPath]].\n\n===GameObjectives===\n\nThese\
      \ are game goals, objects that players must handle to play the game.  CTF FlagBases,\
      \ Double Domination DomPoints, Bombing Run BombSpawns or BombDeliveries, Onslaught\
      \ Nodes and Cores are all GameObjectives.  Some of these are configured to indicate\
      \ to bots if they should be defended, if they are destroyable, what [[Legacy:AIScript|AIScript]]s\
      \ should be used to defend it, etc.  See also [[Legacy:GameObjective|GameObjective]].\n\
      \n===RoadPathNodes & FlyingPathNodes (UT2004)===\n\nThese nodes are used for\
      \ vehicles.  They require the widest, clearest path possible (white color coded).\
      \  They can be spread much farther apart than normal PathNodes.  It is critical\
      \ to have a full route of clear (White) [[Legacy:RoadPathNode|RoadPathNode]]s\
      \ (or [[Legacy:FlyingPathNode|FlyingPathNode]]s) from one GameObjective to another\
      \ and to the vehicle factories in order for bots to effectively use vehicles.\
      \  See also [[Legacy:Pathing For Vehicles|Pathing for Vehicles]] and [[Legacy:Pathing\
      \ 2k4 Flying Vehicles|Pathing 2k4 Flying Vehicles]].\n\n==Special Handling==\n\
      \nInevitably, mappers will encounter situations that require tweaking of the\
      \ bot's normal  navigation system.  Sometimes the default bot path network will\
      \ include a path leading directly into an obvious hazard.  Sometimes the bots\
      \ will need to be told a specific path to take from a particular node.  Sometimes,\
      \ a system complex behaviors is needed for specific purposes in a map.\n\n===Forced\
      \ Paths===\n\nAll nodes that deal with navigation (from PlayerStarts to Vehicle\
      \ Path nodes) have an array available to define Forced Paths.  A forced path\
      \ is a specific directive to bots traveling from a node, of which node to go\
      \ to next.\n\n===Proscribed Paths===\n\nAll node that deal with navigation also\
      \ have Proscribed Paths.  Proscribed Paths tell bots of forbidden nodes to travel\
      \ to from the node they're on.  It is the opposite of a Forced Path.\n\n===AIScripts\
      \ & ScriptedSequences===\n\nBots can be told very specific things to do with\
      \ an AIscript.  An AIscript is a series of commands designed to override the\
      \ normal Bot, TeamAI and SquadAI code with custom behavior.  Almost anything\
      \ that a player can do, can be achieved using AIscipts.  A ScriptedSequence\
      \ is an actor with a customizable array of actions it will perform.  Some of\
      \ these actions can be used to control bots, much like a simplified version\
      \ of an AIScript.  Often they are used as Defensive Scripts or Sniper Scripts.\
      \  However, a misguided Script can simply make the bot predictable and easy\
      \ to defeat.  See also [[Legacy:Creating And Using ScriptedActions|Creating\
      \ and Using ScriptedActions]], [[Legacy:ScriptedAction|ScriptedAction]], [[Legacy:ScriptedSequence|ScriptedSequence]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Strategic Bots|Strategic Bots]].\n\n==Pathing Special Areas==\n\
      \n===Water ===\n\nDon't place pathnodes above water but in it or bots will bob\
      \ up and down under the pathnode trying to reach it.\n\n===Lifts===\n\nA lift\
      \ system has an entry point and an exit point.  Bots need to know where those\
      \ points are and where the lift currently is.  This is described with LiftCenter\
      \ and LiftExit actors.  See also [[Legacy:Pathing Lifts|Pathing Lifts]].\n\n\
      ===Ladders===\n\nIn UT2003/UT2004, a ladder is a special volume that allows\
      \ a player inside to move up and down instead of forward and back.  Bots need\
      \ to be told where to enter and exit the ladder volume.  This is done with Ladder\
      \ actors.  See also [[Legacy:Add A Ladder|Add A Ladder]].\n\n===JumpPads===\n\
      \nJumpPads are nodes that throw players and bots through the air to a destination\
      \ node, like an ordinary PathNode.  Bots know what that destination node is\
      \ by the ForcedPath described in the UTJumpPad actor.  See also [[Legacy:UTJumpPad|UTJumpPad]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Pathing Kickers|Pathing Kickers]].\n\n===Doors===\n\nBots need\
      \ to know if doors are closed they need to be opened to travel or shoot through.\
      \  This is done with a Door actor.  The Door actor tells the bots if there are\
      \ any external triggers to open the door.  The Door actor can also tell bots\
      \ to ingore the path through the door if it is closed; used for locked or triggered\
      \ doors that block the path.  See also [[Legacy:Door|Door]].\n\n===Teleporters===\n\
      \nTeleporters simply hook up to the bot path network by the two end point nodes.\
      \  Bots immediately know how to use them to navigate.  See also [[Legacy:Teleportation\
      \ Basics|Teleportation Basics]].\n\n==Pathing Topics==\n\nOther pages cover\
