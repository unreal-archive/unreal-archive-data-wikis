      \ title=\"Edit section: Setting it Up\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Use the same settings as stated in the Simple Mesh\
      \ tutorial (<i>16 Grid, Grid snap on</i>).</p>\n<p>Lets start off by creating\
      \ a circle with a radius of 64 (Same radius as the pipe in the previous tutorial).\
      \ Convert it to an editable spline and go into element. Select the circle and\
      \ clone it over and up 256 Units (<i>256 units right, 256 units up</i>). Now\
      \ rotate it 90 degrees. We have now created the beginning and end of the 90\
      \ degree pipe.</p>\n<p>Now, lets create the splines to connect the two pieces.\
      \ Since this is an even 90 degree piece, this will be very easy. Draw 3 circles\
      \ from the midpoint of the existing circles(From the left circle go up until\
      \ it is parallel with the other circle, draw the new cirles from there) Create\
      \ the circles so that they line up with the existing circles. Take the circle\
      \ in the middle and clone it down so it lines up with the bottom of the circle,\
      \ and move the circle that you clone from up so it lines up with the top of\
      \ the pipe beginning / end. You should now have something like this:</p>\n<div\
      \ class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_spine_rpipe_1.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\" title=\"Note the extra part of the circles, they need to be\
      \ removed to leave just a 90 degree section\"><img alt=\"Note the extra part\
      \ of the circles, they need to be removed to leave just a 90 degree section\"\
      \ src=\"/w/images/Legacy_spine_rpipe_1.jpeg\" width=\"537\" height=\"383\" /></a></div>\n\
      </div>\n<p>Now you'll need to shave off the extra parts of the circles. First\
      \ you should select the pipe beginning/end object and attatch all the loose\
      \ circles to it (<i>The surface tool only works on a single object</i>). Now\
      \ go into segment select mode and select all those extra loose segmenets and\
      \ delete them. Hmm it looks like a rounded pipe to me&#160;:). Lets make a <b>Referenced</b>\
      \ clone and apply the surface modifier so we can see our curved pipe.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spicing_up_the_pipe\">Spicing up the pipe</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Creating_A_Rounded_Mesh_Using_Splines?section=4\" title=\"\
      Edit section: Spicing up the pipe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Right now, the pipe is pretty boring, so lets add\
      \ rounded flanges on the end. This is a lot easier than it sounds. Remember,\
      \ you don't have to do anything to make the referenced surface update, it'll\
      \ do it by itself as you edit. You need to be in element edit mode(with the\
      \ spline object selected) while doing the following.</p>\n<p>Lets start by cloning\
      \ the end circle over twice, 16 units each time. Now lets uniformly scale the\
      \ circle upwards by 120 (<i>Look at the XYZ fields at the bottom of the screen\
      \ for the scale factor</i>). You should now have this:</p>\n<div class=\"center\"\
      >\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_spine_rpipe_2.jpeg\" class=\"\
      image\"><img alt=\"Legacy spine rpipe 2.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_spine_rpipe_2.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"537\" height=\"383\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>The next part is a little\
      \ tricky. We need to look in the front view and draw a circle using the edge\
      \ creation method, and drag from left to right to connect the two shorter circles.\
      \ Now attatch the newly created circle. As you may of noticed, the top of the\
      \ is slightly taller then the circle we scaled by 120 earlier. To remedy this,\
      \ cut endpoint snapping on and drag the small circle's vert to the top of the\
      \ largest circle's vert. If done correctly they will snap and line up exactly(<i>Cut\
      \ endpoint snapping off when you aren't using it</i>). Now is a good time to\
      \ delete the extra lower half of the circle.</p>\n<p>You may of noticed that\
      \ the circle may not be in a shape you exactly like. You can change the shape\
      \ by moving the handles on the circle's verts. Play around with them and you\
      \ will get the shape you want. Mine turned out looking like this:</p>\n<div\
      \ class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_spine_rpipe_3.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\" title=\"Keeping the small piece lined up is the hardest part,\
      \ but EndPoint snapping makes it a lot easier\"><img alt=\"Keeping the small\
      \ piece lined up is the hardest part, but EndPoint snapping makes it a lot easier\"\
      \ src=\"/w/images/Legacy_spine_rpipe_3.jpeg\" width=\"537\" height=\"383\" /></a></div>\n\
      </div>\n<p>Now, clone the circle we just made to the other parts of the circle.\
      \ (<i>3 times in all, the left, right, and bottom</i>) Remember to rotate it\
      \ 90 degrees each time to line it up, and if you have problems lining it up,\
      \ use endpoint snapping to snap the small piece like you did on the top. (<i>Select\
      \ the top vert at the top of the half-circle, drag it to the vert of the big\
      \ circle</i>). If everything went well, you should be able to look at your referenced\
      \ mesh and see the flange at the end of it. As you may of noticed, the concentration\
      \ of polygons on the flange is very high. Lets use a less polygon intensive\
      \ method on the other side.</p>\n<p>Lets begin making our lower-poly flange\
      \ by copying the top circle end up 32 units. Next use create line tool to draw\
      \ a line between the top two verts of the two circles. \"But that doesn't look\
      \ very round to me, and when I click on the verts of the line I don't see any\
      \ handles?\". Right you are, we are about to do something about that. You need\
      \ to select both verts of JUST the line we created. To make this easier, under\
      \ <b>Selection</b> in the <b>Editable Spline</b> check <b>Segment End</b>. This\
      \ allows you to click on the segment and it selects the nearest vert that belongs\
      \ to it. Hold control and select both verts of the line. After doing so, hold\
      \ control and right click <b>ON</b> one of the verts. This will pop of a new\
      \ menu. Go to <b>Edit/Edit Spline Menu-&gt;Bezier</b>. This converts the verts\
      \ from corner to Bezier. Now you will be able to give the spline a nice curve\
      \ by dragging the handles. Mine ended up like this:</p>\n<div class=\"center\"\
      >\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_spine_rpipe_4.jpeg\" class=\"\
      image\" title=\"Handles do not make the line go exactly to their position, they\
      \ only make the line 'lean' that way\"><img alt=\"Handles do not make the line\
      \ go exactly to their position, they only make the line 'lean' that way\" src=\"\
      /w/images/Legacy_spine_rpipe_4.jpeg\" width=\"537\" height=\"383\" /></a></div>\n\
      </div>\n<p>All thats left to do is clone / rotate it like you did for the other\
      \ end. The entire scene ended up looking like this:</p>\n<div class=\"center\"\
      >\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_spine_rpipe_5.jpeg\" class=\"\
      image\" title=\"The flange on the right side is much more reasonable to be used\"\

      \ src=\"/w/images/Legacy_spine_rpipe_5.jpeg\" width=\"537\" height=\"383\" /></a></div>\n\
      </div>\n<p>Notice how the second spline method we used resulted in less polys,\
      \ and fits better with the polygon concentration of the rest of the object.\
      \ Some would even suggest adding in second circle in the middle of the bend\
      \ so the bend would be smoother. I'll leave that to you as a bonus exercise&#160;:)\
      \ (<i>Hint, you'll have to divide the long splines that make the bend</i>)</p>\n\

    text: "This tutorial will cover creating a 90 degree pipe that goes with the T-Section\
      \ pipe we created in the [[Legacy:Creating_A_Simple_Mesh_Using_Splines|Creating_A_Simple_Mesh_Using_Splines]]\
      \ tutorial.\n\n==Preface ==\n\nI will only be introducing one new element into\
      \ spline modeling: '''Bezier lines'''. Bezier lines allow you to control the\
      \ shape of a line, which is exactly what we want to do to create rounded objects.\n\
      \nAlso, all of the cloning/edits I mention are done in the top view unless otherwise\
      \ stated.\n\n===What are these Bezier Lines you speak of? ===\n\nSee also [[Wikipedia:Bezier\
      \ curve]]\n\nYou've been working with them all along, just not knowingly. Circles\
      \ are a form of Bezier splines. If you ever clicked on the vertex of a circle\
      \ you would of noticed that two little green squares with a yellow line connecting\
      \ them would of appeared around the vertex. These are called '''handles'''.\
      \ By moving these handles you can change the shape of the curve on the spline.\n\
      \n==Setting it Up ==\n\nUse the same settings as stated in the Simple Mesh tutorial\
      \ (''16 Grid, Grid snap on'').\n\nLets start off by creating a circle with a\
      \ radius of 64 (Same radius as the pipe in the previous tutorial). Convert it\
      \ to an editable spline and go into element. Select the circle and clone it\
      \ over and up 256 Units (''256 units right, 256 units up''). Now rotate it 90\
      \ degrees. We have now created the beginning and end of the 90 degree pipe.\n\
      \nNow, lets create the splines to connect the two pieces. Since this is an even\
      \ 90 degree piece, this will be very easy. Draw 3 circles from the midpoint\
      \ of the existing circles(From the left circle go up until it is parallel with\
      \ the other circle, draw the new cirles from there) Create the circles so that\
      \ they line up with the existing circles. Take the circle in the middle and\
      \ clone it down so it lines up with the bottom of the circle, and move the circle\
      \ that you clone from up so it lines up with the top of the pipe beginning /\
      \ end. You should now have something like this:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_spine_rpipe_1.jpeg|center|Note\
      \ the extra part of the circles, they need to be removed to leave just a 90\
      \ degree section]]\n\nNow you'll need to shave off the extra parts of the circles.\
      \ First you should select the pipe beginning/end object and attatch all the\
      \ loose circles to it (''The surface tool only works on a single object'').\
      \ Now go into segment select mode and select all those extra loose segmenets\
      \ and delete them. Hmm it looks like a rounded pipe to me :). Lets make a '''Referenced'''\
      \ clone and apply the surface modifier so we can see our curved pipe.\n\n===Spicing\
      \ up the pipe ===\n\nRight now, the pipe is pretty boring, so lets add rounded\
      \ flanges on the end. This is a lot easier than it sounds. Remember, you don't\
      \ have to do anything to make the referenced surface update, it'll do it by\
      \ itself as you edit. You need to be in element edit mode(with the spline object\
      \ selected) while doing the following. \n\nLets start by cloning the end circle\
      \ over twice, 16 units each time. Now lets uniformly scale the circle upwards\
      \ by 120 (''Look at the XYZ fields at the bottom of the screen for the scale\
      \ factor''). You should now have this:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_spine_rpipe_2.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nThe next part is a little tricky. We need to look in the front view and draw\
      \ a circle using the edge creation method, and drag from left to right to connect\
      \ the two shorter circles. Now attatch the newly created circle. As you may\
      \ of noticed, the top of the is slightly taller then the circle we scaled by\
      \ 120 earlier. To remedy this, cut endpoint snapping on and drag the small circle's\
      \ vert to the top of the largest circle's vert. If done correctly they will\
      \ snap and line up exactly(''Cut endpoint snapping off when you aren't using\
      \ it''). Now is a good time to delete the extra lower half of the circle.\n\n\
      You may of noticed that the circle may not be in a shape you exactly like. You\
      \ can change the shape by moving the handles on the circle's verts. Play around\
      \ with them and you will get the shape you want. Mine turned out looking like\
      \ this:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_spine_rpipe_3.jpeg|center|Keeping the small piece\
      \ lined up is the hardest part, but EndPoint snapping makes it a lot easier]]\n\
      \nNow, clone the circle we just made to the other parts of the circle. (''3\
      \ times in all, the left, right, and bottom'') Remember to rotate it 90 degrees\
      \ each time to line it up, and if you have problems lining it up, use endpoint\
      \ snapping to snap the small piece like you did on the top. (''Select the top\
      \ vert at the top of the half-circle, drag it to the vert of the big circle'').\
      \ If everything went well, you should be able to look at your referenced mesh\
      \ and see the flange at the end of it. As you may of noticed, the concentration\
      \ of polygons on the flange is very high. Lets use a less polygon intensive\
      \ method on the other side.\n\nLets begin making our lower-poly flange by copying\
      \ the top circle end up 32 units. Next use create line tool to draw a line between\
      \ the top two verts of the two circles. \"But that doesn't look very round to\
      \ me, and when I click on the verts of the line I don't see any handles?\".\
      \ Right you are, we are about to do something about that. You need to select\
      \ both verts of JUST the line we created. To make this easier, under '''Selection'''\
      \ in the '''Editable Spline''' check '''Segment End'''. This allows you to click\
      \ on the segment and it selects the nearest vert that belongs to it. Hold control\
      \ and select both verts of the line. After doing so, hold control and right\
      \ click '''ON''' one of the verts. This will pop of a new menu. Go to '''Edit/Edit\
      \ Spline Menu->Bezier'''. This converts the verts from corner to Bezier. Now\
      \ you will be able to give the spline a nice curve by dragging the handles.\
      \ Mine ended up like this:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_spine_rpipe_4.jpeg|center|Handles\
      \ do not make the line go exactly to their position, they only make the line\
      \ 'lean' that way]]\n\nAll thats left to do is clone / rotate it like you did\
      \ for the other end. The entire scene ended up looking like this:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_spine_rpipe_5.jpeg|center|The\
      \ flange on the right side is much more reasonable to be used]]\n\nNotice how\
      \ the second spline method we used resulted in less polys, and fits better with\
      \ the polygon concentration of the rest of the object. Some would even suggest\
      \ adding in second circle in the middle of the bend so the bend would be smoother.\
      \ I'll leave that to you as a bonus exercise :) (''Hint, you'll have to divide\
      \ the long splines that make the bend'')\n\n==Wrapping it Up ==\n\nIn this tutorial\
      \ we created a curved pipe and added rounded flanges using the basics of Bezier\
      \ splines. I hope you learned much from this tutorial. Remember, using Max is\
      \ a learning experience. I learn something almost every time I use it. For example,\
      \ I never knew that you could convert Spline types using a menu until today.\
      \ (Holding Control, Shift, or Alt all pop up different right click menus)\n\n\
      Sorry if the tutorial was a little vauge in places. The subject is a little\
      \ hard to explain. As usual, I'm open to suggestions / comments  &rarr;[[Legacy:Dr.Nick|Dr.Nick]]\n\

      \  Given the required context, I actually think this would make sense as a subpage\
      \ for that modelling program, since it's probably not that useful (and potentially\
      \ rather confusing) for anybody using other software.  At the very least, there\
      \ should be some mention somewhere of what program this thing is assuming the\
      \ reader is using..\n\n[[Category:Legacy Tutorial|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
