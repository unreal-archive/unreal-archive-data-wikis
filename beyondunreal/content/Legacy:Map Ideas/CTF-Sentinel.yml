      <p>CTF-Sentinel has a layout similar to CTF-Face. Maybe a little more closed\
      \ in.</p>\n<p>There is a sentinel in the middle of the map that oversees a good\
      \ portion of the no-man-land in the middle. Also in the middle is a domination\
      \ point.</p>\n<p>The sentinel belongs to the team that is in control of the\
      \ domination point. In order to cap the flag, the carrier must run through the\
      \ sentinel's line of fire. (of course we aren't talking about an over-the-top\
      \ base defending sentinel, but a well-balanced one, like the ones that you have\
      \ to destroy as one of the objectives in AS-Mothership. But in this case, the\
      \ sentinel will be indestructible. Destroying it would take away the entire\
      \ point of the map. Also of course the sentinel will not take the place of players\
      \ trying to intercept the carrier. Control of the sentinel will be a secondary\
      \ objective.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coding_Requirements:\"\
