      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>first off the miltary sniper. Its a conventional bolt\
      \ action one shot weapon that requires you to draw back the bolt after each\
      \ shot. in Multiplayer though, you have to reload it twice after each shot IE\
      \ you fire the gun, you draw back the bolt and reload and then return the gun\
      \ to its firing position, but then it reloads again. not really a big problem\
      \ and not too frustrating, but its nice to be aware of anyway.</p>\n<p>occasionally,\
      \ with all guns, even after a proper reload the bullet count doesnt change.\
      \ just reload again to fix the problem.</p>\n<p>You find a problem simular to\
      \ the sniper reload bug with the cobra cannon. if you reload the gun with any\
      \ amount of bullets in it, it works fine. but if you run out of bullets while\
      \ firing, you have to go through the tedious reload procedure twice.</p>\n<p>Sometimes,\
      \ most likely in a streetwar, you pick up two 9mm SMGs that have 125/60 bullets\
      \ in the counter. It doesnt take a mathmatician to work out that if one smg\
      \ holds 36 bullets then 2 hold 72 and somethings a bit off if you have 125 bullets.Im\
      \ not entirely sure what causes this problem, but its probably something to\
      \ do with reloading or picking up extra ammo. Just reload to return the bullet\
      \ count to normal. (or you could keep firing all the bullets; you dont have\
      \ to reload as much = )This can happen in all of the SMGs and handguns.</p>\n\
      <p>A little thing i discovered by accident- the infinite ammo \"cheat\" for\
      \ SMGs. Take two micro vipers and fire them till you have 2/0 bullets in the\
      \ counter. Now, switch to 1 micro viper (by pressing alt-fire,usually right\
      \ mouse button) . The counter should display 1/1 bullets. Reload the single\
      \ micro viper and the counter should display 2/0 bullets. Now, switch back to\
      \ 2 micro vipers and viola! 4/0 bullets in the counter. if you keep doing this\
      \ you can end up very quickly with 100/0 bullets. You can do this is all of\
      \ the SMGs and handguns.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Singleplayer_Bugs\"\

      \ this problem on Chozo, but im sure it will happen on other maps too. Basically,\
      \ there is a set order of objectives and the level ends when they are all fulfilled.\
      \ Now, technically the order in which they are completed shouldnt really matter,\
      \ but seemingly it does. In Chozo, the objectives read-</p>\n<p>1: defend the\
      \ base/ eliminate remaining attackers</p>\n<p>2: Download the security code</p>\n\
      <p>3: Hack the enemy laser fences</p>\n<p>4: destroy the spawner</p>\n<p>Now\
      \ what i did after obective #1 was completed was to send two rat drones to destroy\
      \ the spawner. When i did i got the \"objective completed\" message. this is\
      \ the last objective, but becasue it was fulfilled before it was supposed to\
      \ be, it messes up the rest of the game. Even if i got the codes and hacked\
      \ the fences, nothing happened, The level just kept on running no matter what\
      \ i did. The lesson- if it says \"hack the fences\" before \"destroy the spawner\"\
      , DO IT!</p>\n<p>You also find a simular problem on multiplayer if the spawner\
      \ is destroyed before hacking a fence. Although this shouldnt be possible theres\
      \ bugs on some maps (Union *cough* *cough*) which allow this to happen.</p>\n\
      <p>I ran into a similar problem in The rock, and im totally clueless as to what\
      \ caused it. Bascically, the level got totally screwed up and stopped registering\
      \ completed objectives and when i got to the end of the tunnel where the boat\
      \ is, the level didnt end as it was supposed to but allowed me to drop off the\
      \ end of the tunnel and into the skybox terrain parts outside the level. The\
      \ drop should have killed me, but i ended up with -20 health. So, here i am,\
      \ outside the level in a part i was never supposed to be with - 20 health and\
      \ a screwed up objective manager. Time to restart the level i think.</p>\n<p>Still\
      \ more too add, so if you find any more bugs/fixes, feel free to add them here.</p>\n\
      <p>The horrid respawn bug</p>\n<p>During most of the game I got a horrid bug\
      \ everytime I respawned. For one, I had to press continuously on</p>\n<p>the\
      \ \"B\" key before the weapons list would finally show up. Now, after that,\
      \ I had to choose my weapons on</p>\n<p>and on and on until they finally showed\
      \ up in my hands. Add both things and you'll be able to guess how</p>\n<p>very\
      \ tedious all that was.</p>\n<p>The back to the desktop bug</p>\n<p>Yes, indeed.\
      \ I got thrown back to my desktop loads of times, always during action scenes\
      \ (and the game is</p>\n<p>precisely about action). Fortunately, the game would\
      \ do some sort of emmergence save most of the times it</p>\n<p>happened. But\
      \ not everytime.</p>\n<p>Thank you for letting me cooperate.</p>\n<p>Bukko -\
      \ don't use the rat drone!</p>\n<p>This isn't really a bug, just something I\
      \ believe wasn't clearly thought of and I think I should leave a</p>\n<p>word\
      \ of warning... In the Bukko level you can use a rat drone to destroy the spawn\
      \ machine inside the Nako</p>\n<p>Naki building. I did. Don't make the same\
      \ mistake! Afterwards, the machine can't be really fixed (or wasn't</p>\n<p>in\
      \ my game - it's so full of bugs I can't tell anymore), so that everytime you\
      \ die you'll come back there</p>\n<p>but it'll be impossible for you to choose\
      \ guns. Meaning you'll have to walk miles back to another spawner</p>\n<p>to\
      \ get the weapons you need - everytime! Very annoying.</p>\n<p>Killing Jonathan</p>\n\
      <p>Just one last thing. It's not a bug, more like a rat, but I think it can\
      \ prove useful. The easiest way to</p>\n<p>kill Jonathan in the last level,\
      \ although I haven't seen it mentioned like that anywhere, is to use rat</p>\n\
      <p>drones and complement them with a heavy weapon. After disconneting (or connecting,\
      \ whatever) the two tower</p>\n<p>devices and taking care of all the other meanies\
      \ around, approach the place where Jonathan without being</p>\n<p>seen (on the\
      \ left) and use rat drones to hit him about three or four times. Then, climb\
      \ up the stairs and</p>\n<p>start shooting. He'll die and you'll be able to\
      \ shoot the blueish light above his dead body, which is what</p>\n<p>you have\
      \ to do. Then you may die, respawn and startit over a few times until he finally\
      \ disappears with a</p>\n<p>bang.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time\
