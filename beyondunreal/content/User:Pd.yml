      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>This is my first and still ongoing <b>UT2004</b> modding\
      \ project. Its initial creators were <a href=\"/edit/Fluffy?redlink=1\" class=\"\
      new\" title=\"Fluffy (page does not exist)\">fluffy</a> and <a href=\"/edit/Jrubzjeknf?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Jrubzjeknf (page does not exist)\">Jrubzjeknf</a>, basically\
      \ an extension of UT2004RPG on top of DruidsRPG. Since I took over, I have been\
      \ merging all this into one package and have been fixing an astronomical amount\
      \ of bugs and performance problems.</p>\n<p>At this time, barely any of the\
      \ original UT2004RPG code is left. My plan is to make it zero. The ideas, however,\
      \ are basically still the same, because those worked quite well.</p>\n<p>TitanRPG\
      \ 1.60 has been released in October 2010, however, compared to now it is already\
      \ outdated again. The project has an official website <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\

      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Fluffy (page does not exist)\">fluffy</a>, I have implemented\
      \ the <b>Conquest</b> gamemode for <b>UT2004</b>. It's practically ONS in overtime.\
      \ The powercores drain from the start, however they're not attackable. The only\
      \ way to win is to hold more power nodes than the enemy for a longer time, until\
      \ the first core has drained down to zero. Also unlike ONS, there are no links\
      \ between the nodes. Any node is attackable at any time.</p>\n<p>See <a rel=\"\
      nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://bigbattleservers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=2384\"\
      >here</a> for the full story.</p>\n<p>No public release because the game type\
      \ proved to be pretty boring, even in some 24+ player test games.</p>\n<h4><span\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Raid\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>A game type where you have to clear a dungeon.</p>\n\
      <p>Basically like Invasion, just that each \"wave\" (they aren't actually waves,\
      \ I call them \"rooms\") takes place in different rooms of the map you're playing.\
      \ The monsters that spawn are also defined on the map rather than the gametype\
      \ config (config-side overrides are on the TODO list). Bosses are supported.\
      \ Monsters can also drop configurable rewards like health pickups and ammunition\
      \ by chance.</p>\n<p>Players spawn in the room they cleared last or in the initial\
      \ spawning room if the game just started. The game is won when all rooms have\
      \ been cleared, secret rooms that have not to be cleared to win are possible\
      \ (interesting for RPG).</p>\n<p>No release yet because I can't get a map done.\
      \ Maybe a demo map will suffice.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\
      VCTF4\">VCTF4</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/User:Pd?section=10\" title=\"Edit section: VCTF4\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Leaked\
      \ in the Epic Games forum already (much to my dismay), the VCTF4 gametype. It\
      \ builds upon CTF4 and adds vehicle support and - which was the major part of\
      \ the work - vehicle skins and projectile coloring. Since CTF4 is unfortunately\
      \ pretty buggy, I also attempt to fix a range of those bugs however possible\
      \ by subclassing, so I don't have to edit CTF4 itself.</p>\n<p>More on VCTF4\
      \ can be read <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://bigbattleservers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=3011\"\

      \ href=\"/edit/User:Pd?section=11\" title=\"Edit section: ONS4\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The next logical\
      \ step after VCTF4 would be ONS4. Node skins etc are done, but due to the amount\
      \ (not necessarily difficulty) of coding work required for that, it is in alpha\
      \ stage at best.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"UT3004\">UT3004</span><span\

      \ href=\"/edit/User:Pd?section=12\" title=\"Edit section: UT3004\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>This is a series\
      \ of little mod projects for <b>UT3</b>, reviving the things we loved about\
      \ UT2004. None of them are actually finished and therefore none are released\
      \ yet.</p>\n<p>The following mods are close to being done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Mine\
      \ Layer</b> - a UT2004-style parasite mine layer, with the original art converted\
      \ by <a href=\"/edit/Jeffrey?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Jeffrey (page\
      \ does not exist)\">Jeffrey</a> and <a href=\"/edit/Uno_chaos?redlink=1\" class=\"\
      new\" title=\"Uno chaos (page does not exist)\">uno_chaos</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Adrenaline\
      \ Combos</b> - a fully working UT2004-style adrenaline system and HUD and working\
      \ key combos (Speed, Booster, Invisible, Berserk), plus another optional mod\
      \ to spawn adrenaline pickups on random PathNodes on any map, with pickup art\
      \ done by <a href=\"/edit/Uno_chaos?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Uno chaos\
      \ (page does not exist)\">uno_chaos</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since I consider UT3\
      \ an utter failure from both a gamer and also partially from a developer perspective,\
      \ I have no plans to finish these mods. I might release them as beta at some\
      \ point so whomever is intertested can finish these.</p>\n<p>The following mods\
      \ are <i>cancelled</i>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Lightning Gun</b> - a UT2004-style\
      \ lightning gun.</li>\n<li><b>Grenade Launcher</b> - UT2004-style happy fun\
      \ balls.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"UT3RPG\">UT3RPG</span><span\

      \ href=\"/edit/User:Pd?section=13\" title=\"Edit section: UT3RPG\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>A UT3 RPG mod inspired\
      \ by TitanRPG (see above). Unlike BattleRPG, this is configurable and supports\
      \ custom weapons like the Mine Layer.</p>\n<p>However, again, since I consider\
      \ UT3 a failure, this mod was cancelled in alpha stage. No plans to finish it\

      \ have been helping maintaining several of the UT2004 servers since.\n\nBy now,\
      \ mainly thanks to the development of TitanRPG, I can call myself a UT2004 coding\
      \ generalist and I also possess a little deeper knowledge on UnrealEngine 2.5\
      \ thanks to my hobby of reverse engineering things. ;)\n\n==Contact==\n[http://bigbattleservers.com/forum/\
      \ #1 BIG BATTLE SERVERS - FORUM] - Find the red bold nickname that reads \"\
      pd_\".\n\n==UnrealEngine work==\nIn my time, I've covered many areas of UnrealEngine\
      \ (mainly 2.5) editing.\n\nYet, you might have never heard my name anywhere\
      \ before.\nThat's because I'm much too lazy to release things to the public.\n\
      If you want anything of the things below released so you can use it, please\
      \ kick my butt very hard.\n\n===Mapping===\nWhile I claim to have vast theoretical\
      \ mapping knowledge, I run short of creativity. ;)\nTherefore, there are only\
      \ a few VCTF maps that I actually released and only for my favorite server (although\
      \ some of them have found their ways to other servers):\n\n====Finished maps====\n\
      *'''VCTF-Oasis'''\n*'''VCTF-Cookehs''' (beta, never really finished because\
      \ it's not too great at all)\n*'''VCTF-CookehMountain'''\n*'''VCTF-Quaternity'''\n\
      *'''VCTF-ActionCity2''' (based on VCTF-ACTIONCITY, heavily pimped visuals and\
      \ altered balance, made from scratch)\n*'''VCTF-Schlachtfeld''' (with support\
      \ by [[Darkemule]])\n*'''VCTF-Forest''' (with support by [[Darkemule]], still\
      \ beta but basically finished)\n*'''VCTF-XtremeWall'''\n*'''VCTF4-QuaternarySpace'''\
      \ (conversion of VCTF-BinarySpace for VCTF4)\n*'''VCTF4-BlockFort''' (remake\
      \ of the Mario Kart 64 map for VCTF4)\n*'''VCTF4-Orb''' (currently beta as VCTF4-Orbital,\
      \ name will be changed to avoid confusion with CTF-Orbital)\n\n====Unfinished\
      \ maps====\n*'''VCTF-Moon''' (name?)\n*'''VCTF-SpaceWars''' (name?)\n*'''VCTF-TheLostWorld2010'''\
      \ (name? - based on VCTF-TheLostWorld2, heavily pimped visuals and altered balance,\
      \ made from scratch)\n*'''VCTF4-Oasis2'''\n\n===Modding===\nThere are more projects\
      \ in my portfolio than I'm listing here, but those are minor.\nHere's the bigger\
      \ ones:\n\n====TitanRPG====\nThis is my first and still ongoing '''UT2004'''\
      \ modding project. Its initial creators were [[fluffy]] and [[Jrubzjeknf]],\
      \ basically an extension of UT2004RPG on top of DruidsRPG. Since I took over,\
      \ I have been merging all this into one package and have been fixing an astronomical\
      \ amount of bugs and performance problems.\n\nAt this time, barely any of the\
      \ original UT2004RPG code is left. My plan is to make it zero. The ideas, however,\
      \ are basically still the same, because those worked quite well.\n\nTitanRPG\
      \ 1.60 has been released in October 2010, however, compared to now it is already\
      \ outdated again.\nThe project has an official website [http://titanrpg.pdinklag.de].\n\
      \n====Conquest====\nBased on an idea by [[fluffy]], I have implemented the '''Conquest'''\
      \ gamemode for '''UT2004'''. It's practically ONS in overtime. The powercores\
      \ drain from the start, however they're not attackable.\nThe only way to win\
      \ is to hold more power nodes than the enemy for a longer time, until the first\
      \ core has drained down to zero.\nAlso unlike ONS, there are no links between\
      \ the nodes. Any node is attackable at any time.\n\nSee [http://bigbattleservers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=2384\
      \ here] for the full story.\n\nNo public release because the game type proved\
      \ to be pretty boring, even in some 24+ player test games.\n\n====Raid====\n\
      A game type where you have to clear a dungeon.\n\nBasically like Invasion, just\
      \ that each \"wave\" (they aren't actually waves, I call them \"rooms\") takes\
      \ place in different rooms of the map you're playing. The monsters that spawn\
      \ are also defined on the map rather than the gametype config (config-side overrides\
      \ are on the TODO list). Bosses are supported. Monsters can also drop configurable\
      \ rewards like health pickups and ammunition by chance.\n\nPlayers spawn in\
      \ the room they cleared last or in the initial spawning room if the game just\
      \ started. The game is won when all rooms have been cleared, secret rooms that\
      \ have not to be cleared to win are possible (interesting for RPG).\n\nNo release\
      \ yet because I can't get a map done. Maybe a demo map will suffice.\n\n====VCTF4====\n\
      Leaked in the Epic Games forum already (much to my dismay), the VCTF4 gametype.\
      \ It builds upon CTF4 and adds vehicle support and - which was the major part\
      \ of the work - vehicle skins and projectile coloring. Since CTF4 is unfortunately\
      \ pretty buggy, I also attempt to fix a range of those bugs however possible\
      \ by subclassing, so I don't have to edit CTF4 itself.\n\nMore on VCTF4 can\
      \ be read [http://bigbattleservers.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=3011 here].\n\
      \n====ONS4====\nThe next logical step after VCTF4 would be ONS4. Node skins\
      \ etc are done, but due to the amount (not necessarily difficulty) of coding\
      \ work required for that, it is in alpha stage at best.\n\n====UT3004====\n\
      This is a series of little mod projects for '''UT3''', reviving the things we\
      \ loved about UT2004.\nNone of them are actually finished and therefore none\
      \ are released yet.\n\nThe following mods are close to being done:\n*'''Mine\
      \ Layer''' - a UT2004-style parasite mine layer, with the original art converted\
      \ by [[Jeffrey]] and [[uno_chaos]].\n*'''Adrenaline Combos''' - a fully working\
      \ UT2004-style adrenaline system and HUD and working key combos (Speed, Booster,\
      \ Invisible, Berserk), plus another optional mod to spawn adrenaline pickups\
      \ on random PathNodes on any map, with pickup art done by [[uno_chaos]].\n\n\
      Since I consider UT3 an utter failure from both a gamer and also partially from\
      \ a developer perspective, I have no plans to finish these mods. I might release\
      \ them as beta at some point so whomever is intertested can finish these.\n\n\
      The following mods are ''cancelled'':\n*'''Lightning Gun''' - a UT2004-style\
      \ lightning gun.\n*'''Grenade Launcher''' - UT2004-style happy fun balls.\n\n\
      ====UT3RPG====\nA UT3 RPG mod inspired by TitanRPG (see above). Unlike BattleRPG,\
      \ this is configurable and supports custom weapons like the Mine Layer.\n\n\
      However, again, since I consider UT3 a failure, this mod was cancelled in alpha\
      \ stage. No plans to finish it or release it in any form.\n\n===Server administration===\n\
      I've been helping maintaining the UT2004 portion of [http://bigbattleservers.com/\
      \ #1 BIG BATTLE SERVERS] for a while now.\nThanks to my few UT3 projects, I\
      \ also know how to run UT3 servers."
