      <p>Ever wonder why bots do what they do? Especially when you think they should\
      \ be doing something else? This mutator will allow you to explore the inner\
      \ workings of a bot's mind. This mutator lets you discover things like, are\
      \ they picking the right spots to defend? Why do they go there? How are my paths\
      \ working?</p>\n<p>The best way to use this mutator is as a spectator, otherwise\
      \ you'll be too busy shooting to make use of it. You can use it in the regular\
      \ flying-camera mode, or by switching to spy on individual bots. If you do the\
      \ flying-camera thing, then you'll get data on whatever bot you're looking at,\
      \ as an extension of the player name that always pops up when you look at someone.<br\

      <ul>\n<li><i>State</i> Every object in UnrealScript has states; bots have states\
      \ like Fallback, Retreat, Falling, and Dying.</li>\n<li><i>Move Target</i> This\
      \ is usually the nearest pathnode that the bot is moving towards, and it can\
      \ also be an item that the bot is about to pick up.</li>\n<li><i>Enemy</i> Whoever\
      \ the bot's designated target is.</li>\n<li><i>Orders</i> Defending, Attacking,\
      \ Following, etc.</li>\n<li><i>Real Orders</i> The actual orders that have been\
      \ given to a bot. This can sometimes be different from it's working orders.\
      \ For example, if it's told to defend, but there's nothing to defend, it may\
      \ decide to do something else for the time being.</li>\n<li><i>Order Object</i>\
      \ The thing or player the bot was told to defend, or follow, or whatever.</li>\n\
      <li><i>Goal</i> This text string is updated sporadically as a general indicator\
      \ of what the bot is doing. It often becomes obsolete long before it gets updated,\
      \ but it still can be useful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, other indications of potential\
      \ BOT navigation are given, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Red crosshairs</i>\
      \ Enemy</li>\n<li><i>Green box</i> Order Object - Remember this could be a player\
      \ or it could be a thing.</li>\n<li><i>Blue box</i> Move Target - This is usually\
      \ a pathnode, which you otherwise can't see. It may also be an item that the\
      \ bot wants to pick up, or the player that the bot is following.</li>\n<li><i>Blue\
      \ cross</i> Destination - The location that the bot is trying to reach. Usually\
      \ the location of the Move Target, unless the bot is doing Evasive/Tactical\
