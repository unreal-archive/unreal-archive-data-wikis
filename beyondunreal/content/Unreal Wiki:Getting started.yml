      \ account?]] on Wikipedia for more about account creation.\n\n==How to contribute==\n\
      :''Main Article: [[Project:Helping out]]''\nThese are some of the basic ways\
      \ that you can do to improve the site:\n\n* '''Fix errors''' such as grammar\
      \ or spelling mistakes. Doing a lot of small fixes can greatly improve the quality\
      \ of the site.\n* '''Improve the content''' by rewording sentences and paragraphs\
      \ so that they are easier to understand.\n* '''Create new content.''' There\
      \ are still many subjects that haven't been described adequately or haven't\
      \ been written about at all. If you're knowledgeable on a subject, you can aid\
      \ us in [[Help:Starting a new page|creating content]] for it.\n* '''Format pages.'''\
      \ If you're good with [[Help:Formatting|Wiki markup]], you can look for pages\
      \ that need to be improved visually.\n\n==Editing pages==\n:''Main Article:\
      \ [[Help:Editing pages]]''\nIf you have something to contribute, you should\
      \ add it.  Don't worry (too much) about making mistakes.  Mistakes on the wiki\
      \ are [[Project:Revert|pretty easy to fix]], and we would rather have editors\
      \ who contribute lots of information and make a few mistakes than have editors\
      \ who never add their information because they are too worried about not being\
      \ able to do it perfectly. Remember that perfection isn't required.  As you\
      \ get more comfortable with the wiki, you'll probably want to familiarize yourself\
      \ with the [[Project:Style guide|style guide]] and maybe even a few other [[Project:Policies\
      \ and guidelines|policies and guidelines]] (nobody wants to be a nublet forever!),\
      \ but you're likely to learn as much from the experience of actually editing\
      \ as from reading about it. \n\nTo edit a page, all you have to do is click\
      \ the [edit] button on the top of the screen, make your changes, preview them,\
      \ then click on the \"Save page\" button. Your contribution will automatically\
      \ appear on the article.  You can play around with the editing feature at our\
      \ [[Project:Sandbox|sandbox]] – the place you can edit freely without worrying\
      \ about messing things up.\n\n===Wiki markup===\n:''Main Article: [[Help:Formatting]]''\n\
      You can do many casual edits with little to no knowledge of the wiki markup.\
      \ However, if you want to become more serious about editing and be able to format\
      \ your edits so that they look better, you will need to learn some basic wiki\
      \ markup. We have a [[Help:Quick editing guide|quick editing guide]] which explains\
      \ the more simple commands, a more general help page on [[Help:Formatting|formatting]],\
      \ and you could also see Wikimedia's [[metawikipedia:Help:Editing|editing walkthrough]]\
      \ for more details.\n\n===Talk pages===\n:''Main Article: [[Help:Talk pages]]''\n\
      Discussion pages, also referred to as talk pages, are where editors discuss\
      \ how they can improve the main article.  Anyone can ask a question, answer\
      \ an existing question, or contribute to an existing discussion.  There are\
      \ two kinds of talk pages: Regular talk pages, which are used to discuss articles,\
      \ and user talk pages, which are used to talk with editors. The rules used on\
      \ discussion pages are slightly different from those on article pages.  '''In\
      \ particular, contributions to discussion pages should always be signed''' (contributions\
      \ to articles should never be signed).\n\n==Keep in mind==\n:''Main article:\
      \ [[Project:Policies and guidelines]]''\nBefore you dive in and start editing,\
      \ we do have a few things that you should keep in mind.\n\n===Content criteria===\n\
      :''Main article: [[Project:Style guide]]''\nEven though everyone can edit, this\
      \ does not mean that the site is a free-for-all. Content submitted should always\
      \ be informative, verifiable, professional, and legible, and content that does\
      \ not uphold to these criteria will likely be removed. You should also integrate\
      \ what you want to add into what we have instead of creating something separate\
      \ from the current content or even a duplicate page. As for your tone while\
      \ writing, make sure that it addresses the reader when necessary and not yourself.\n\
      \n===Conduct===\nWe promote an atmosphere of kindness and friendliness, which\
      \ is usually apparent when examining the community of the site. However, at\
      \ times there are sometimes disagreements and even heated disputes among editors,\
      \ but everyone here is expected to behave in a civil manner at all times.\n\n\
      The most important thing to do is to assume good faith with your fellow editors.\
      \ Don't assume that others are acting in spite or malice. If another editor\
      \ does something that is upsetting to you, leave a message on their talk page\
      \ or where appropriate and politely express your concerns. You may have avoided\
      \ a potentially embarrassing misunderstanding or a frivolous dispute.\n\nWikipedia\
      \ has an extensive collection of [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Etiquette|principles\
      \ of \"Wikiquette\"]], which are always a good idea to follow.\n\n==In conclusion==\n\
      You now know the most important things that you need to know to contribute to\
      \ the project. Do you feel like something is missing or not adequately explained?\
      \ Leave a message on the [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|discussion]] so that we can improve\
      \ it. You should also introduce yourself to some of our active members in the\
      \ project. Create a user page and/or user talk page, leave an introduction on\
      \ the [[Project:Community Portal|community portal]]."
