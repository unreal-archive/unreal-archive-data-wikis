      <p>UnrealEngine2's editor changed the behaviour of the <a href=\"/Legacy:Red_Builder_Brush\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Red Builder Brush\">red builder brush</a>, and it no longer\
      \ remembers its rotation from one build to the next. This I find annoying, though\
      \ I'm sure it's cut down on a lot of n00b posts in forums.</p>\n<p>But ever\
      \ since this, I've wanted to include a rotation parameter in my brushbuilders\
      \ to make up for this lost functionality.</p>\n<p>So I've added a rotation parameter\
      \ today. But not any old rotation. It's a <i>string</i> rather than a regular\
      \ rotator, and you can specify rotations in R<a href=\"/Legacy:UU\" title=\"\
      Legacy:UU\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UU</a> as normal, or in degrees, with a string\
      \ like \"90d\".</p>\n<p>What's even cooler is that the Cylinder builder overrides\
      \ the parsing function, and lets you specify an angle in terms of the number\
      \ of sides you've given for the cylinder.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      <p>Due to some new commitments I am soon taking on, I will not have as much\
