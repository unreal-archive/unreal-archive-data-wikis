      <p>The Unreal engine is one of the fastest 3D game engines around. More than\
      \ that, it's flexible and easy to adapt. More still, UnrealEd, the editing application,\
      \ is fast and powerful. Stand by, there's a 'but'. In their haste to unleash\
      \ Unreal games onto the world, the folks at Epic didn't take the time to write\
      \ much by way of documentation for the engine. We don't blame them – how would\
      \ it have sounded if they'd said \"UT is delayed by 2 months, while we write\
      \ up how to edit for it\"? We wouldn't have been amused. What they did write\
      \ is great (<a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealScript_Language_Reference\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealScript\
      \ Language Reference\">UnrealScript Language Reference</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:Mod_Authoring\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mod Authoring\">Mod Authoring</a>) but it's highly technical\
      \ and not for the faint-hearted.</p>\n<p>So the community at large muddles along,\
      \ and information is passed along in the many Unreal Editing forums across the\
      \ web, and also with a lot of guesswork. Since Unreal was released way back,\
      \ many tutorial sites have sprung up, and many mappers have put up information\
      \ about editing on their sites along with their creations.</p>\n<p>It's great...\
      \ as far as it goes. To look up a piece of information, you need a list of links\
      \ as long as your arm to stand any chance of finding what you're looking for.\
      \ Many of the great reference sites are no longer updated, and only partly relevant\
      \ to working with UT's UnrealEd 2. Many tutorials only cover part of what you\
      \ need to know, or they go over the basics... again.</p>\n<p>So, what's the\
      \ story here? You've heard it all before: \"new tutorial site\", \"ultimate\
      \ reference\", blah blah blah. Only this time, there really is a difference.\
      \ This site is a WikiWikiWeb, or Wiki for short. The Wiki system is a powerful\
      \ tool for open document creation. Upshot: any reader can instantly edit any\
      \ page on the site. You don't need to email an admin to recommend changes, you\
      \ don't need to submit new material for approval. What you add to the site will\
      \ be subject to peer approval, which means everybody, including you.</p>\n<p>Here's\
      \ how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the site as a reference. When you find:\n\
      <ul>\n<li>a page that could say more on a topic</li>\n<li>something that could\
      \ be explained more clearly</li>\n<li>a topic that isn't covered</li>\n<li>or\
      \ a good old-fashioned mistake</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>... just\
      \ change it, there and then. You don't need to commit your life to the site,\
      \ just a couple of minutes. Edit, save, you've made a contribution.</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>if you want to write material, great. Reference, tutorials, anything\
      \ you like. It's best if you find a suitable page to link new pages from, but\
      \ you can always link from <a href=\"/Legacy:Mapping_Lessons\" title=\"Legacy:Mapping\
      \ Lessons\">Mapping Lessons</a> or <a href=\"/Legacy:Inbox\" title=\"Legacy:Inbox\"\
      >Inbox</a> and sooner or later somebody will rearrange the site structure to\
      \ fit your material in.</li>\n<li>if you already have tutorials, you can import\
      \ them. In fact, you can import your whole tutorial site wholesale, and add\
      \ your site's header and page design to the available skins here. Just remember...\
      \ they may well get updated, improved and expanded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:New_Contributors_Quick_Start\" title=\"Legacy:New Contributors Quick\
      \ Start\">New Contributors Quick Start</a> page covers details you may want\
      \ to quickly browse before making any edits.</p>\n<p>That's it... enjoy.</p>\n\
