      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Logons are saved on a per-CVSROOT basis. The passwords are\
      \ stored (in encrypted form) in a file called .cvspass in your Windows user\
      \ directory (or whatever else you specified as your \"HOME directory\" in the\
      \ \"WinCvs\" tab of the \"Preferences\" dialog).</p>\n<p>I can't tell you which\
      \ password you have because I frankly don't know anymore, and the passwords\
      \ are encrypted. I can, however, give you an entirely new password if you send\
      \ me one (either in plain text or encrypted with \"crypt\", for instance via\
      \ <code>perl -e\"print crypt 'mypass', 'tq'\"</code>).</p>\n<p>I agree though\
      \ that WinCvs has a few bugs whose presence in a version that has seen a release\
      \ to the general public is hard to comprehend. (I absolutely do not understand\
      \ why it sorts file names in <i>reverse</i> alphabetical order by default, for\
      \ instance, and won't let me change that default beyond a single session.) Using\
      \ WinCvs deems me more convenient for most everyday tasks though than using\
      \ the commandline \"cvs\" tool. For one, it nicely highlights the files that\
      \ have been changed in a directory.</p>\n<p>If somebody knows an alternative\
      \ for Windows though I'd be happy to give it a try.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ The only .cvspass file on my system no longer contains anything about UnrealWiki.\
      \ Not sure how that came about. What baffles me is this: logons are on a per-directory\
      \ basis: each folder has a /cvs/root file with the address of the remote server.\
      \ But the Logon menu command – how does it <i>know</i> which server you're trying\
      \ to log into?&#160;:con:</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> WinCVS needs native\
      \ SSH support, using PuTTY sshagent is just a pain, or a way to prompt for a\

      \ I just don't want to put my password in plain text.</p>\n<p><b>Eldhrin:</b>\
