      <p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that it bugs me when people want to understand\

      >126654</a> is a sad example of this. (Apart from the fact that the thread's\
      \ initiator has, by now, posted <b>five</b> different threads on the same subject\
      \ in the Coding forum, and has ignored my request to stick to one thread with\
      \ a single subject and use <code>[code]...[/code]</code> for readability.)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Dante:</b> Yeap, I'm Bytekeeper in this thread&#160;;) The problem with\
      \ Uscript is, that most people think it's very easy, because it's a script-language.\
      \ So they start out reading a tutorial instead of reading the language reference.\
      \ If you understand the language, and you got the class-tree, he's problem is\
      \ very easy. But as he has no idea of what he's doing, he assumes imho to have\
      \ a pre-basic scriptlanguage with hardcoded spawn() and no objects or so ( just\
      \ guessing myself here too&#160;;) ) I mean <i>trial-and-error</i> is an approach\
      \ we all needed ( Not c&amp;p but you always learn from errors&#160;;) ) But\
      \ you're right, copy&amp;paste behaviour with exchanging one or two lines by\
      \ copy&amp;paste from another script&#160;:rolleyes: is something <i>those people</i>\
      \ have in common. And what really annoys me that they aware of that we <b>don't\
      \ need to help them</b>, do they think it's our job or what&#160;? I guess after\
      \ UT2k3 comes out, I need to c&amp;p \"RTFM\" very often.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Yes, you're right about trial-and-error, of course. I actually prefer it a\
      \ <i>lot</i> if people just try something out before they ask (same applies\
      \ to myself). What I actually mean is this particular sort of trial-and-error\
      \ where the guesses are <i>random</i> ones, not more or less educated ones.\
      \ – By the way, I personally found posting Unreal Wiki links a pretty good substitute\
      \ for RTFM. It's more helpful and gets the basic idea of RTFM across just as\
      \ well. &#160;:-D</p>\n<p><b>Dante:</b> You're right, of course&#160;:) But\
      \ I think even with a pointer to Unreal Wiki, they will continue. It's the lazyness\
      \ of reading manuals. They don't even recognize that they would be faster than\
      \ waiting for a reply on the forum...</p>\n<p><b>capt. k.:</b> It's not possible\
      \ that a guy who acts like a 14 year old, has a command of written English like\
      \ a 14 year old, and doesn't know anything more than a 14 year old could possibly\
      \ *be* 14 years old, is it?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Your point being?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> I learnt trig at school starting at 13. I have nothing against\
      \ young er coders. If you want to do stuff that hasn't yet been taught at school,\
      \ start with books, or better still, convince your school to bump you up a year.&#160;:D</p>\n\
      <p><b>capt. k.:</b> My point being that people who say they don't know trig\
      \ are probably saying that because they don't know trig. I'm not sure what it's\
      \ like out in everyone else's part of the world, but up my way trig isn't touched\
      \ till around 10th grade, and vectors aren't covered in anything short of college-level\
      \ courses. Maybe Tarquin's just gifted, I dunno. &#160;:)</p>\n<p>Not trying\
      \ to be contentious here – and I don't disagree, people should learn to RTFM\
      \ – but I don't think things like ignorance are usually anyone's fault.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> I will afree that my rant is ill-thought-out and badly-formed.\
      \ It's not a patch on Mych's rants which are sensible and clearly-laid out.\
      \ What I'm saying is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>don't know trig and don't want to do trig?\
      \ fine.</li>\n<li>don't know trig but want to do things that require it, and\
      \ therefore want to learn it? fine.</li>\n<li>don't know trig but want to do\
      \ things that require it, but <i>still don't want to learn it</i>?&#160;:rolleyes:</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Even as a 14-year-old, I knew (or at least I <i>think</i>\
      \ I knew) that random guesses are the most inefficient way to get something\
      \ done, and that the key to understanding other people is <i>listening</i> to\
      \ them. (I think around that age I started to learn assembler by reading a book\
      \ about it.) The guy in this thread I linked to seems just not to be reading\
      \ what other people write (or what the compiler tells him), and doesn't seem\
      \ to be willing to follow people's pointers for further reading. I see a distinct\
      \ difference between <i>ignorance</i> and <i>lack of knowledge</i>.</p>\n<p><b>capt.\
      \ k.:</b> Nah. Ignorance is ignorance.&#160;:) The distinction is what one choses\
      \ to do about it.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Maybe it's my German background.\
      \ <i>Unkenntnis</i> (lack of knowledge) states a mere fact, <i>Ignoranz</i>\
      \ (ignorance, I'd translate) implies a degree of bad will. In any case, \"what\
      \ one choses to do about it\" is exactly the difference I'm seeing between the\
      \ two.</p>\n<p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> Actually the way most text books treat trigonometry,\
      \ vectors, and matrices is in my opinion needlessly complicated.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ I'd agree with that, to some extent. I believe that those concepts are expressed\
      \ the way they are so that they more easily translate to other applications\
      \ in more advanced math courses though.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Well, sadly,\
      \ I'm only in grade 9 so I'm stuck with boring algebra. No trignometry for me\
      \ *sigh*</p>\n<p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> Probably, but what really happens is that\
      \ the student gives up on math totally. And many of the people that do make\
      \ the effort never really understand what they are doing. (In effect they collect\
      \ of bunch of recipes that work but they don't understand WHY)</p>\n<p><b>Dirk\
      \ Fist:</b> Maybe a trig-for-UT page&#160;? Showing all the wonderful simplifications\
      \ Epic has provided&#160;? Never use PI again! (except as a food&#160;;))</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> we have one.... somewhere&#160;:) ... <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealScript_Vector_Maths\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UnrealScript Vector Maths\">UnrealScript Vector Maths</a></p>\n\
      <p><b>Mortal Monkey:</b> I learned my trig thanks to UScript &amp; Wiki. The\
      \ maths they teach at school here almost appears to be intentionally boring.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I do have to agree somewhat about people not really understanding\
      \ what they're learning. A perfect example in my opinion is complex numbers.\
      \ -1 doesn't have a square root, by definition. Presumably, there's \"complex\
      \ numbers\" but I've yet to meet someone who can offer a plausable explanation\
      \ on what a complex number is. By that token, I don't think anyone really understands\
      \ what they are (well I do, a figment of your imagination&#160;:P) but people\
      \ have been taking them on faith since their inception. (Granted, they do wonders\
      \ for some mathematical problems, but that doesn't mean anyone understands them.)\
      \ A thug doesn't need to understand what makes a blade cut things in order to\
      \ stab someone.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Actually <i>I</i> understand them&#160;:)\
      \ -1 has a square root once you define one. Complex numbers just fall out from\
      \ that choice.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> So, in order for it to work, you have\
      \ to assign an arbitrary value? That sounds like Enron mathematics to me.&#160;:P</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> No... in the real number system, -1 has no root. So we say\
      \ \"suppose it HAS a root OUTSIDE the system\". let's CALL that root i. \"i\"\
      \ is not an \"arbitrary value\", it is a label.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Well,\
      \ I suppose so. But it's still just made up, right? Since there's no real value\
      \ that it could ever represent.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Your question is not\
      \ phrased in a way I can understand. Do you mean \"real\" as in \"real number\"\
      \ or \"reality\"? <i>i</i> is not a \"real number\", but it's a \"real\" number.\
      \ imaginary numbers are no more fictitious that negatives, for example.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Oh. Well, what I meant was real as in reality. As far as I\
      \ can see, imaginary numbers aren't really numbers, just a notation that represents\
      \ some equation or condition. I don't see any way that they could be used directly\
      \ for any sort of application without being converted back to the real number\
      \ system first.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> That could be said of all numbers. Think\
      \ of what \"-1\" means. The problem seems to be that you're not really sure\
      \ what you mean, and neither am I. There is nothing 'made up' about <i>i</i>,\
      \ at least no more than any other number.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Well, a real\
      \ number like -1 can be manipulated. Though in theory an imaginary number can\
      \ be manipulated too, the result will be undefined, so really an imaginary number\
      \ is just representing something for the sake of representing it in a different\
      \ form, since once it's there you can't do anything with it.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ What do you mean by 'manipulated'? And what do you mean by 'undefined'? You're\
      \ not making any sense. Are you trolling?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> No, I'm not\
      \ trolling, I'm just saying, as per the point that was made by Dirk Fist, that\
      \ I think complex numbers are an excessively overcomplicated method that violate\
      \ existing rules of mathematics, and as such I don't think that they can be\
      \ understood properly. Certainately, a person could use them for stuff, but\
      \ I don't think that makes them a valid mathematical construct.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ ok. But 1) they are not complicated b) they don't violate any rules 3) they\
      \ can be understoof properly 4) there really isn't any such thing as an invalid\
      \ mathematical construct. I think we'd better leave this discussion at that,\
      \ because I think you are confusing mathematics with arithmetic.</p>\n<p><b>Dirk\

      <p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> On the subject of complex numbers I don't understand em.\
      \ And I wonder if anyone else does either lets take a simple equation which\
      \ is used throwout vector math X*X + Y*Y = R*R the equation of a circle now\
      \ lets say that R*R = -5 what shape is it now? In how many dimensions&#160;?\
      \ Does equality have meaning for complex numbers&#160;? (ie R*R=B*B for multiple\
      \ values B which are demonstrably different&#160;?) Whats happens when R*R =\
      \ i&#160;? Square root comes from the definition of area, a negative area would\
      \ be a hole, saying that the width of the a square hole is a magnitude perpendicular\
      \ to normal numbers seems unnatural to me.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Don't mix\
      \ it up. The definitions e.g. for square root have been extended for complex\
      \ numbers because it was neccessary. Don't try to imagine objects with a complex\
      \ width or something, that will only cause futher confusion.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ Thanks Wormbo&#160;:) Good answer. In fact, \"Square root\" DOESN'T come from\
      \ the definition of area – that's engineer talk. Area just HAPPENS to nicely\
      \ fit with squares and square roots.</p>\n<p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> As far as I know\
      \ the first use of square roots as a concept is the pythagorean theorium <a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.ies.co.jp/math/java/geo/pythasvn/pythasvn.html\"\
      >http://www.ies.co.jp/math/java/geo/pythasvn/pythasvn.html</a> Hence the definition\
      \ of square root does come from the definition of area. As far as complex width\
      \ or other quantities, you say the definition was extended because it was neccessary,\
      \ therefore there are real world properties for which these numbers apply. It\
      \ is also obvious that rather than answer the question, you have responded by\
      \ essentially saying that it cannot be understood.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Again,\
      \ don't confuse the <i>application</i> of maths to the real world with the <i>abstract</i>\
      \ nature of maths. The notion of area may have originally inspired the notion\
      \ of multiplication, but not necessarilly. Multiplication is just repeated addition.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> I'm not confusing the <i>application</i> of maths with\
      \ the <i>abstraction</i>. My Question is NOT how do I use complex numbers, there\
      \ are plenty of formalulae out there for the multiplication, division etc. of\
      \ complex numbers. But so far no one here has demonstrated an understanding\
      \ of them in the <i>abstract</i>, Or for that matter has shown a need for them.\
      \ As far as I can tell they are essentially a thought experiment that has gotten\
      \ out of hand. Another non-euclidean method of handling negative roots is the\
      \ fact that a square root has indeterminate sign (hence ± in front of it) therefore\
      \ it is equally valid to say that the square of a value with indeterminate sign\
      \ has indeterminate sign. Under this interpretation the square root of -1 =\
      \ ±1.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Ok, Dirk and Foxpaw, you both need to understand\
      \ something: ALL of maths is a \"thought experiment\". It is a purely logical\
      \ discipline. It often happens to have useful applications. Until you can accept\
      \ this fact, things such as complex numebrs will indeed seem incomprehensible\
      \ to you. And no, it is not \"equalyl valid\" to say a square has an inderterminate\
      \ sign. That is completely wrong.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> I'd like to add that\
      \ complex numbers have quite some very useful applications as well. There are\
      \ cases where calculations with real numbers would actually be much more complex\
      \ than calculations with complex numbers. (Or something... o_O)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ yup, things like residue integration. Also, complex numbers are used to represent\
      \ stuff to do with quantum particules, IIRC. If you imagine real numbers as\
      \ a line, and complex numbers as a plane, it just means you have more \"elbow\
      \ room\" to do things in.&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Indeed, quantum mechanics\
      \ would be unthinkable without complex numbers – and without quantum mechanics,\
      \ modern semiconductor physics wouldn't be thinkable, and without modern semiconductor\
      \ physics, none of us would be able to discuss this matter on the Unreal Wiki...</p>\n\
      <p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> Since ALL maths is nothing more than a thought experiment\
      \ then viewing roots as having indeterminate sign IS equally valid. Much like\
      \ Non-euclidean geometry, in which some of the 'LAWS' are assumed to be wrong\
      \ and the resulting geometries are found to be equally valid, with real world\
      \ applications. As far as extending numbers to multiple dimensions that's what\
      \ vectors are for, also since in the end complex numbers are ALWAYS represented\
      \ as pairs of real numbers ANY application of complex numbers can be accomplished\
      \ EQUALLY well with real numbers. And still no one can say what the shape of\
      \ X*X + Y*Y = -5 is&#160;? Or how many dimensions that shape would occupy&#160;?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Dirk, you still don't get it. Complex numbers extend numbers\
      \ because parts of the numbers system are \"missing\" until you put them in:\
      \ the real numbers are not complete, exactly <i>because</i> -1 has no square\
      \ root. The notion of complex numbers follows on from the basic axioms of number\
      \ theory. You're right about non-euclidean geometry, but you're not really putting\
      \ things together properly: to avoid having complex numbers, you'd need to make\
      \ changes at a much lower level. And complex numbers are \"sort of\" like vectors\
      \ in one way, but really, they're not at all. Vectors don't solve problems about\
      \ numbers, they are a layer on top of them. Now I could really blow your mind\
      \ and tell you that you can have vectors defined <i>over</i> complex numbers....&#160;:D\
      \ I suggest you go and learn more about the subject before you generalize things\
      \ you don't seem to fully understand. Frankly, you're bugging me, you're being\
      \ n00bish and you're bordering on trolling. (And X*X + Y*Y = -5 is a 4-dimensional\
      \ shape, if you're defining X and Y to be in the domain of complex numbers.\
      \ 4-dimensional shapes are useful, don't knock em.)</p>\n<p><b>Ironblayde:</b>\
      \ Wow, I just found this page for the first time. One hell of a rant. I just\
      \ want to suggest to Dirk, that talking about complex numbers as being distinct\
      \ from real numbers isn't really accurate. Complex numbers aren't a completely\
      \ separate entity, but a generalization. They constitute a larger set of numbers\
      \ which <i>includes</i> the real numbers as a subset. (Any real number x is\
      \ the complex number c = x + 0i.) Saying that complex numbers are useless when\
      \ we already have real numbers is like saying that rational numbers are useless\
      \ because we already have integers. Also your analogy to non-Euclidean geometries\
      \ isn't really appropriate either. Non-Euclidean geometries arise from replacing\
      \ Euclid's parallel postulate with a slightly different version... but that\
      \ postulate (that given a line L and a point P not on L, there exists exactly\
      \ one line through P parallel to L) is a statement that <i>cannot be proven</i>.\
      \ Replacing such a thing with a different assumption is a little different than\
      \ just redefining a well-established term like a square root to mean what you\
      \ want it to mean.</p>\n<p>On the original topic (as if anyone remembers the\
      \ original topic by now&#160;:)), I agree completely. I'm new to UnrealEd so\
      \ I haven't seen people making the particular comments Tarquin referred to,\
      \ but I've seen plenty of people new to game programming in general say similar\
      \ things. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've tried and failed to talk\
      \ a would-be hobbyist programmer out of trying to code a 3D engine when he doesn't\
      \ even know what a pointer is.&#160;:rolleyes: Too many people out there worry\
      \ so much about expanding the <i>breadth</i> of their knowledge as quickly as\
      \ possible that they forget to be concerned with the <i>depth</i> of what they\
      \ know, and then they're surprised when the whole pile collapses at the first\
      \ sign of trouble.</p>\n<p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> If you will refer back you will\
      \ see I never claimed to understand them. Sorry for being Noobish. On the <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Quaternion\" title=\"Legacy:Quaternion\">Quaternion</a> page\
      \ quaternions are described as 4 dimensional complex numbers with two additional\
      \ roots for -1 (j and k). Additionally it states that the multiplication of\
      \ two quaternions is the combination of the rotations specified by the quaternions.\
      \ So how do you meaningfully multiply i*j, i*k, j*k&#160;? It is obvious that\
      \ i,j and k are perpendicular (otherwise they would disappear in the sum).</p>\n\
      <p><b>Ironblayde:</b> For multiplying the three imaginary units, i*j = -j*i\
      \ = k, j*k = -k*j = i, k*i = -i*k = j. So what you said was right; for example,\
      \ if you think about i, j, and k being unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes,\
      \ respectively, their cross products evaluate as above.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/Legacy:Quaternion\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Quaternion\">Quaternions</a> are a great application of complex\
      \ numbers that are, as far as I know, used pretty often in computer graphics.\
      \ In addition to not suffering from the problem of gimbal lock as the aforementioned\
      \ page points out, they're also well-suited for interpolating between two orientations,\
      \ e.g. getting a camera to follow a smooth path.</p>\n<p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> One\
      \ of the things that bugs me though is that if this was a four component vector\
      \ you would still have a cross product without the special treatment for the\
      \ <i>real</i> component. It is interesting that the cross product of parallel\
      \ vectors is zero (all terms cancel out) so using vector rules i*i = 0</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> remember: vectors and complex numbers are not at all the\
      \ same! Vector are <i>on top</i> of numbers: they are objects that can be multiplied\
      \ by numbers. Complex numbers are numbers extended to a larger space. There\
      \ are some similarities (depending on hos you look at them), but for things\
      \ like multiplication and products, it does not help at ALL to try to compare\
      \ them.</p>\n<p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> Actually complex numbers are just as much\
      \ <i>on top of</i> numbers as vectors. Since the alternative is that X*X + Y*Y\
      \ = -5 is an equation in two dimensions (X,Y) where the dimensions <i>just happen</i>\
      \ to be two dimensional. Also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/complex_number\"\
      \ class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:complex number\">Wikipedia:complex number</a>\
      \ lists complex numbers as a special case matrices which is a special case of\

      wikipedia:Linear algebra\">Wikipedia:Linear algebra</a></p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ Except that in the example above it would actually be <tt>(a + bi) * (a +\
      \ bi) + (d + ei) * (d + ei)</tt> (unless you prefer using j I guess).</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Dirk, the notion of vector space can be applied to many things.\
      \ You can choose to write negative numbers as an ordered pair of positives (a,b)\
      \ with b &gt; a if you like – that makes negative numbers vectors over the positives\
      \ (to a certain extent – the axioms fail because it's not a field). Stop thinking\
      \ of vectors as a physical concept; that is only one aplication of them. A vector\
      \ is an object that you can multiply by a number: that's what I mean by vectors\
      \ being \"over\" numbers. Many things can be considered as vectors, not just\
      \ spatial vectors used in applied maths. The analogy between complex numbers\
      \ and vectors breaks down when you consider multiplicaiton. At this point, you\
      \ have to think of complex numbers as just an enlargement of numbers rather\
      \ than sitting over them.</p>\n<p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> X*X + Y*Y = -5 is an equation\
      \ in two unkowns it only becomes four unkowns if you CONVERT the complex numbers\
      \ to pairs of ordinary numbers in which case it becomes the equation a*a+2*a*b*i-b*b+d*d+2*e*d*i-e*e\
      \ = -5 which can be seperated into the pair of equations (a*a+d*d) - (b*b+e*e)\
      \ = -5 and a*b+e*d = 0 now at this point a, b,d or e could be complex, which\
      \ makes the dimensions of this equation potentially infinite.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ WHAT??? You can't do that! When you decompose a complex # into two reals,\
      \ they are REALs. You can't then say \"oh, they might be complex\". Come on.\
      \ It's stuff like this that makes me think you're just trolling. If you're this\
      \ confused about how maths works, go ask a teacher or get a book. You could\
      \ go read <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra\"\
      \ class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Fundamental theorem of algebra\">Wikipedia:Fundamental\
      \ theorem of algebra</a> but it'll probably worry yyou even more ...&#160;:D</p>\n\
      <p><b>Dirk Fist:</b> So your saying that once you decompose them into reals\
      \ the square root of -1 no longer has a solution&#160;?</p>\n<p><b>Darwedu:</b>\
      \ No. Complex numbers don't stop existing, but you know a,b,d and e are NOT\
      \ complex. You divided the complex equation into two real equations, and both\

      <p><b>Mortal Monkey:</b> So is ±5&#160;!= 5 then?</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b> ±\
      5 is two numbers as in the root of x^2=25. It can also bea range of numbers,\
      \ which is used in error/precision notation.</p>\n<p><b>Mortal Monkey:</b> An\
      \ example:</p>\n<p>Let's say X = 5². We would then know that sqrt(X) = 5, not\
      \ ±5, because 5 is positive.<br />\nNow let's also assume X = Z². We don't know\
      \ wether Z is positive or negative, therefore sqrt(X) = ±Z.<br />\nNow what\
      \ happens if someone else later tells us that Z = 5?<br />\n5 = sqrt(X) = ±\
      5</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I don't think that SQRT(5²) is 5. To my knowledge,\
      \ the \"solution\" would be the complete set of numbers that satisfy the equation.\
      \ So it would still be ±5. Or so says my Calculus professor.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ \"square root\" is a 2-valued function, so yes, the answer is ±5, or just\
      \ \"5 and -5\". But \"SQRT\" in computing is by convention \"the positive of\
      \ the two square roots\", so it's just 5. Likewise the root sign – that also\
      \ means the positive one, which is why you have to write ±√x in formalae to\
      \ mean both roots. See <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/square_root\"\

      \ connection seems to be acting up, wikipedia keeps giving me 404s. Anyway,\
      \ how does a power function work? Because (±5)² does not produce {25, 25}, does\
      \ it?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I <i>believe</i> that it does, though since one\

      <p>Note the date on the revision prior to yours.</p>\n<p><b>EricBlade:</b> Wow,\
      \ I never saw this page before&#160;:D In my school system, Trig was 11th or\
      \ 12th grade material, and vectors were things that you didn't get until college.\
      \ I also managed to fail Trig twice in high school, and again in my one year\
      \ in college, I think because simply put, no one had at all a convincing reason\
      \ as to what one would ever actually use the stuff for. Since I've been thinking\
      \ about that over the last couple weeks, as I've been learning some of the more\
      \ useful vector functions, I actually called my high school math teacher, and\
      \ asked him to give me an example where in the real world, someone would actually\
      \ use Trig .. the only thing he could come up with was rocketry and aeronautics.\
      \ On that note, I still haven't seen where I would use Trig anywhere in here\
      \ (although that might be because I don't -know- trig), but I am learning the\
      \ ways of using vectors. yay! \"Oh no, not another learning experience!\"</p>\n\

      \ attention in algebra and geometry, then trig is algebra + geometry.</p>\n\
      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> I just finished High School a little over a month ago and\
      \ I've come out with a few things to discuss, I suppose.</p>\n<p>I've been learning\
      \ Trignometry ever since Grade 1, just not all at once. I feel as far as maths\
      \ (and probably even sciences go) they really neglect its complexity for anyone\
      \ under College level maths. Because I've been working with UnrealScript since\
      \ my later years in Elementary (I think!?) I've been blessed with the knowledge\
      \ of what a matrix is, what a vector is and most of the terminology involved.\
      \ Matrices are only ever touched in one math class for about 2 weeks to a month\
      \ and they rarely go in-depth as to why things are the way they are. From grade\
      \ 9 and on I've tried to ask a lot of questions, at my classmates dismay, that\
      \ tried to give clarity to those deeper issues but the teachers tries extremely\
      \ hard to not give me a very good answer for fear of confusing the class or\
      \ me or perhaps they never even had a good way to explain it because it would\
      \ require a University level of math history. They stay away from the complex\
      \ issues surrounding math and its applications and while in the general scheme\
      \ of things it lets the majority who apply themselves get good grades and it\
      \ even lets some of the people who don't apply themselves at all get decent\
      \ grades. Anyways, the point is I don't think we put much faith in the young\
      \ in understanding anything remotely complex. In Calculus and C30, I wanted\
      \ to know how a lot of things would work with the actual addition of the Z-axis.\
      \ In, I believe B30, some people didn't even know that there was a Z-axis involved\
      \ and a question that I asked the teacher he actually just told me to come talk\
      \ to him after class because he said it would throw the entire class off. In\
      \ Grade 4, we learned Multiplication. What we actually did was memorize a multiplication\
      \ chart and while it probably did us some good to know what things multiplied\
      \ to instead of understand the actual theory behind it, I feel it would have\
      \ prepared us more if he did less memorizing and more learning. I understand\
      \ that its sometimes good to generalize and dumb things down to ensure that\
      \ everyone understands it, and even some people who don't have the brain for\
      \ mathematics and \"out of bounds\" thinking struggle with the most basic stuff,\
      \ I feel we should more than just introduce certain aspects of math to students.</p>\n\
      <p>Don't get me wrong there are 'special' programs for these 'higher' kinds\
      \ of math such as the International Baccelaureate (or however you spell it)\
      \ programs but those are seen as programs only for \"smart\" people. What I\
      \ saw more that came out that program was people who were I'd hate to say it,\
      \ either extremely snobby thinking that they are better than anyone who isn't\
      \ in the program, or were extremely helpful (and also confusing to those being\
      \ helped on some occasions) to people in need. The snobby aspect was seen mostly\
      \ though and I think its needless. The math that they are taught isn't too far\
      \ over the math that everyone else took and if one was confused with what they\
      \ were being taught, it would only be because they didn't go indepth in the\
      \ topics that they covered through Elementary and High School. My calculus teacher\
      \ was an IB teacher himself and he taught us pretty much the same way he did\
      \ his IB courses where he would go through a few sheets of paper a bit with\
      \ us and go through some examples and some questions he would answer about as\
      \ he was teaching us but a lot of the time if he felt the answer took some class\
      \ out he would get us to come him, but the point is with that is that the questions\
      \ and answer were usually not above the class and he made time to answer these\
      \ questions. We were left to figure things out pretty much on our own instead\
      \ of having our had held the entire way through our learning experience. Some\
      \ things I said probably overlapped negatively with other things I said but\
      \ this is more of a rant so my thoughts on it are probably not too well thought\
      \ out.</p>\n<p>When I started to work a bit with the actual vectors in UScript\
      \ I did a lot of guesswork even after reading a little material on the subject.\
      \ I understand that it isn't the job of Elementary or High School teachers to\
      \ prepare their students for 3d object manipulation and other such things but,\
      \ it would have been nice to learn about geometry in not 2 but 3 dimensions\
      \ at least introductorily. Perhaps they should cover other advanced topics very\
      \ briefly in math/science classes (we got the 2 dimensions treatment in Physics\
      \ 20 and 30...) which will lead up to optional 'advanced' classes such as Calculus\
      \ that would go over, indepth, those advanced topics. It could just be that\
      \ UScript vectors are set up wierdly, that I'm not sure about, but it was slightly\
      \ confusing walking around in the world of vectors for the first time. And rotators...\
      \ I was FAR too afraid to touch those at that point. And about the arguments\
      \ about picking up a book and reading it, for at least me, asking a teacher\
      \ about a good math book for that sort of stuff was like going to... um... A\
      \ CIA Agent and asking them how to do some of their advanced stuff, whatever\
      \ that may be, that they do. The teacher hesitated, or laughed, maybe even tried\
      \ to suggest a book but wasn't really sure they would. I don't think there were\
      \ (mind you I never REALLY looked) any 'advanced' math books in our library\
      \ and if we did the terminology used would probably have thrown me off. I even\
      \ had the privelage of 'helping' my cousin in University for a bit with vectors\
      \ but didn't turn out too well because her assignments were due faster then\
      \ I could understand her textbook and work out the questions. The terminology\
      \ was just so different from what I was used to and the way they worked with\
      \ Matrices was so 'odd'. Going down to the actual library was sort of out of\
      \ bounds for me too because the Librarians would most likely not know about\
      \ that stuff and what books would be great to learn this or that. I wouldn't\
      \ know where to start. I think thats all I'll say about that for right now.\
      \ Sorry if it sounds a bit off-topic but after reading a bit of this page I\
      \ got the urge to write my views on the Educational system with regards to math...\
      \ which slightly touches on Trignometry and a students understanding of it...</p>\n\

    text: "It's funny that no-one ever says \"I want to code [[Legacy:UnrealScript|UnrealScript]],\
      \ but I don't know how to read yet\".\n\nSo why do people want to work with\
      \ geometry in UnrealScript and in UnrealEd before they understand basic trigonometry?\n\
      \nIt's quite possible to work with UnrealScript and not get involved with vectors\
      \ and trig. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that it bugs me when people\
      \ want to understand vectors, rotators, and angles, but '''still''' say things\
      \ like \"it's got something to do with that horrible trig stuff I didn't pay\
      \ any attention to at school, right?\". \n\nWell, it '''is''' that trig stuff.\
      \ Go away and learn it. Pay more attention in maths lessons, or get books on\
      \ it. It's not rocket science (well, okay, it ''is'' used for rocket science).\
      \ \n\nOkay, just to be nice: [[Wikipedia:Trigonometry]]\n\n----\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Unfortunately, \"I don't know how to read yet\" apparently ''does'' apply\
      \ to a couple of programming [[Legacy:Newbie|newbie]]s as well.  Those are the\
      \ people that program by trial-and-error (copy-paste, maybe randomly replace\
      \ a couple of symbols, then try to recompile), get an error message and post\
      \ something along the lines of \"I get the error message 'type mismatch in parameter\
      \ 1', what does it mean?\" and never bother to read the error message, let alone\
      \ any ''documentation'' that could tell them how to fix it.  [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?threadid=126654\
      \ 126654] is a sad example of this.  (Apart from the fact that the thread's\
      \ initiator has, by now, posted '''five''' different threads on the same subject\
      \ in the Coding forum, and has ignored my request to stick to one thread with\
      \ a single subject and use <code>[code]...[/code]</code> for readability.)\n\
      \n'''Dante:''' Yeap, I'm Bytekeeper in this thread ;) The problem with Uscript\
      \ is, that most people think it's very easy, because it's a script-language.\
      \ So they start out reading a tutorial instead of reading the language reference.\
      \ If you understand the language, and you got the class-tree, he's problem is\
      \ very easy. But as he has no idea of what he's doing, he assumes imho to have\
      \ a pre-basic scriptlanguage with hardcoded spawn() and no objects or so ( just\
      \ guessing myself here too ;) ) I mean ''trial-and-error'' is an approach we\
      \ all needed ( Not c&p but you always learn from errors ;) ) But you're right,\
      \ copy&paste behaviour with exchanging one or two lines by copy&paste from another\
      \ script :rolleyes: is something ''those people'' have in common. And what really\
      \ annoys me that they aware of that we '''don't need to help them''', do they\
      \ think it's our job or what ? I guess after UT2k3 comes out, I need to c&p\
      \ \"RTFM\" very often.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Yes, you're right about trial-and-error,\
      \ of course.  I actually prefer it a ''lot'' if people just try something out\
      \ before they ask (same applies to myself).  What I actually mean is this particular\
      \ sort of trial-and-error where the guesses are ''random'' ones, not more or\
      \ less educated ones. &ndash; By the way, I personally found posting Unreal\
      \ Wiki links a pretty good substitute for RTFM.  It's more helpful and gets\
      \ the basic idea of RTFM across just as well.  :-D\n\n'''Dante:''' You're right,\
      \ of course :) But I think even with a pointer to Unreal Wiki, they will continue.\
      \ It's the lazyness of reading manuals. They don't even recognize that they\
      \ would be faster than waiting for a reply on the forum...\n\n'''capt. k.:'''\
      \  It's not possible that a guy who acts like a 14 year old, has a command of\
      \ written English like a 14 year old, and doesn't know anything more than a\

      \ point being?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I learnt trig at school starting at 13. I have\
      \ nothing against young er coders. If you want to do stuff that hasn't yet been\
      \ taught at school, start with books, or better still, convince your school\
      \ to bump you up a year. :D\n\n'''capt. k.:'''  My point being that people who\
      \ say they don't know trig are probably saying that because they don't know\
      \ trig.  I'm not sure what it's like out in everyone else's part of the world,\
      \ but up my way trig isn't touched till around 10th grade, and vectors aren't\
      \ covered in anything short of college-level courses.  Maybe Tarquin's just\
      \ gifted, I dunno.  :)\n\nNot trying to be contentious here &ndash; and I don't\
      \ disagree, people should learn to RTFM &ndash; but I don't think things like\
      \ ignorance are usually anyone's fault.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I will afree that\
      \ my rant is ill-thought-out and badly-formed. It's not a patch on Mych's rants\
      \ which are sensible and clearly-laid out. What I'm saying is:\n* don't know\
      \ trig and don't want to do trig? fine.\n* don't know trig but want to do things\
      \ that require it, and therefore want to learn it? fine.\n* don't know trig\
      \ but want to do things that require it, but ''still don't want to learn it''?\
      \ :rolleyes:\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Even as a 14-year-old, I knew (or at least I\
      \ ''think'' I knew) that random guesses are the most inefficient way to get\
      \ something done, and that the key to understanding other people is ''listening''\
      \ to them.  (I think around that age I started to learn assembler by reading\
      \ a book about it.)  The guy in this thread I linked to seems just not to be\
      \ reading what other people write (or what the compiler tells him), and doesn't\
      \ seem to be willing to follow people's pointers for further reading.  I see\
      \ a distinct difference between ''ignorance'' and ''lack of knowledge''.\n\n\
      '''capt. k.:'''  Nah.  Ignorance is ignorance. :)  The distinction is what one\
      \ choses to do about it.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Maybe it's my German background.\
      \  ''Unkenntnis'' (lack of knowledge) states a mere fact, ''Ignoranz'' (ignorance,\
      \ I'd translate) implies a degree of bad will.  In any case, \"what one choses\
      \ to do about it\" is exactly the difference I'm seeing between the two.\n\n\
      '''Dirk Fist:''' Actually the way most text books treat trigonometry, vectors,\
      \ and matrices is in my opinion needlessly complicated.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I'd\
      \ agree with that, to some extent. I believe that those concepts are expressed\
      \ the way they are so that they more easily translate to other applications\
      \ in more advanced math courses though.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Well, sadly, I'm\
      \ only in grade 9 so I'm stuck with boring algebra.  No trignometry for me *sigh*\
      \ \n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' Probably, but what really happens is that the student\
      \ gives up on math totally. And many of the people that do make the effort never\
      \ really understand what they are doing. (In effect they collect of bunch of\
      \ recipes that work but they don't understand WHY)\n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' Maybe\
      \ a trig-for-UT page ? Showing all the wonderful simplifications Epic has provided\
      \ ? Never use PI again! (except as a food ;))\n\n'''Tarquin:''' we have one....\
      \ somewhere :) ... [[Legacy:UnrealScript Vector Maths|UnrealScript Vector Maths]]\n\
      \n'''Mortal Monkey:''' I learned my trig thanks to UScript & Wiki. The maths\
      \ they teach at school here almost appears to be intentionally boring. \n\n\
      '''Foxpaw:''' I do have to agree somewhat about people not really understanding\
      \ what they're learning. A perfect example in my opinion is complex numbers.\
      \ -1 doesn't have a square root, by definition. Presumably, there's \"complex\
      \ numbers\" but I've yet to meet someone who can offer a plausable explanation\
      \ on what a complex number is. By that token, I don't think anyone really understands\
      \ what they are (well I do, a figment of your imagination :P) but people have\
      \ been taking them on faith since their inception. (Granted, they do wonders\
      \ for some mathematical problems, but that doesn't mean anyone understands them.)\
      \ A thug doesn't need to understand what makes a blade cut things in order to\
      \ stab someone.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Actually ''I'' understand them :) -1 has a\
      \ square root once you define one. Complex numbers just fall out from that choice.\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' So, in order for it to work, you have to assign an arbitrary\
      \ value? That sounds like Enron mathematics to me. :P\n\n'''Tarquin:''' No...\
      \ in the real number system, -1 has no root. So we say \"suppose it HAS a root\
      \ OUTSIDE the system\". let's CALL that root i. \"i\" is not an \"arbitrary\
      \ value\", it is a label. \n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Well, I suppose so. But it's still\
      \ just made up, right? Since there's no real value that it could ever represent.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' Your question is not phrased in a way I can understand. Do\
      \ you mean \"real\" as in \"real number\" or \"reality\"? ''i'' is not a \"\
      real number\", but it's a \"real\" number. imaginary numbers are no more fictitious\
      \ that negatives, for example.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Oh. Well, what I meant was real\
      \ as in reality. As far as I can see, imaginary numbers aren't really numbers,\
      \ just a notation that represents some equation or condition. I don't see any\
      \ way that they could be used directly for any sort of application without being\
      \ converted back to the real number system first. \n\n'''Tarquin:''' That could\
      \ be said of all numbers. Think of what \"-1\" means. The problem seems to be\
      \ that you're not really sure what you mean, and neither am I. There is nothing\
      \ 'made up' about ''i'', at least no more than any other number. \n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ Well, a real number like -1 can be manipulated. Though in theory an imaginary\
      \ number can be manipulated too, the result will be undefined, so really an\
      \ imaginary number is just representing something for the sake of representing\
      \ it in a different form, since once it's there you can't do anything with it.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' What do you mean by 'manipulated'? And what do you mean by\
      \ 'undefined'? You're not making any sense. Are you trolling?\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ No, I'm not trolling, I'm just saying, as per the point that was made by Dirk\
      \ Fist, that I think complex numbers are an excessively overcomplicated method\
      \ that violate existing rules of mathematics, and as such I don't think that\
      \ they can be understood properly. Certainately, a person could use them for\
      \ stuff, but I don't think that makes them a valid mathematical construct.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' ok. But 1) they are not complicated b) they don't violate any\
      \ rules 3) they can be understoof properly 4) there really isn't any such thing\
      \ as an invalid mathematical construct. I think we'd better leave this discussion\
      \ at that, because I think you are confusing mathematics with arithmetic.\n\n\
      '''Dirk Fist:'''\n\n<uscript>\n          a=b         ; pick ANY two equal numbers\n\
      \        a*a=a*b       ; multiply both sides by a \n    a*a-b*b=a*b-b*b   ;\
      \ subtract b squared from both sides\n (a+b)(a-b)=b(a-b)    ; factor both sides\
      \ \n       a+b =b         ; remove common factor \n       b+b =b         ; replace\
      \ a with b \n         2 =1         ; what happens if b==1 \n</uscript>\n\nthere\
      \ is no such thing as an invalid mathematical construct.\n\n'''DeepQantas:'''\
      \ (a-b) equals zero. Hasn't anyone told you what happens when you divide something\
      \ with zero? ;)\n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' I think that was my point ;D, division by\
      \ zero is inherently undefined you can't fix it by saying they're is some magic\
      \ number K such that K=1/0 \n\nNow can you tell me the flaw in Godel's theory\
      \ ? (Hint : try his reasoning on the set of 3 digit numbers)\n\n'''DeepQantas:'''\
      \ I would, but I wasn't even in the bar where Godel was theorizing... :P\n\n\
      Oh, about those imaginary numbers. The point isn't about just blindly counting\
      \ square roots of negative numbers. That's just a nifty bonus that comes from\
      \ the fact that i*i happened to be -1... I also understand that imaginary numbers\
      \ were developed for, and have a real world use in some high level electronis\
      \ stuff.\n\nAnyone remember about this more specifically?\n\n'''Bob_The_Beheader:'''\
      \ I'm assuming you ment \"electronics.\" Maybe complex numbers are used in analog\
      \ electronics, Like for radios and such, but I've never seen it. I'm positive\
      \ they arn't used in digital electronics.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' When I said 'construct'\
      \ I assumed foxpaw meant it the sense of 'concept', not 'procedure'.\n\n'''Wormbo:'''\
      \ Complex numbers are just a handy extension of the set of real numbers make\
      \ certain things easier. Hey, take a kid who just learned how to add numbers\
      \ and tell him or her that you know a number that can be ''added'' to e.g. 5\
      \ and the result will be ''less than 5''. It's basically the same thing. You\
      \ simply didn't know the whole thing. In fact, you'll never know the whole thing.\
      \ Just ook at [[Legacy:Quaternion|quaternion]]s. ;) \n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Well,\
      \ I think that agrees with Dirk Fists original comment - the child in question\
      \ clearly doesn't understand addition, he or she has only learned a \"recipe\"\
      \ for the addition of numbers - in this case an incomplete one.\n\n'''TwelveBaud:'''\
      \ I know what 2D vectors are. I know what trigonometry is as related to periodic\
      \ graphs, triangles, and a unit circle. E.g. sine, cosine, tangent. This is\
      \ after I've taken all math courses offered in my school system prior to Calc\
      \ BC. Including the programming and CS ones. So why is it I still don't know\
      \ how to to any sort of that stuff in UT, even after trying to find the wiki\
      \ page?\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' You might find what you're looking for on [[Legacy:Vector|Vector]]\
      \ or [[Legacy:UnrealScript Vector Maths|UnrealScript Vector Maths]].\n\n'''Dirk\
      \ Fist:''' On the subject of complex numbers I don't understand em. And I wonder\
      \ if anyone else does either lets take a simple equation which is used throwout\
      \ vector math  X*X + Y*Y = R*R  the equation of a circle now lets say that R*R\
      \ = -5 what shape is it now? In how many dimensions ? Does equality have meaning\
      \ for complex numbers ? (ie R*R=B*B for multiple values B which are demonstrably\
      \ different ?) Whats happens when R*R = i ? Square root comes from the definition\
      \ of area, a negative area would be a hole, saying that the width of the a square\
      \ hole is a magnitude perpendicular to normal numbers seems unnatural to me.\
      \ \n\n'''Wormbo:''' Don't mix it up. The definitions e.g. for square root have\
      \ been extended for complex numbers because it was neccessary. Don't try to\
      \ imagine objects with a complex width or something, that will only cause futher\
      \ confusion.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Thanks Wormbo :) Good answer. In fact, \"Square\
      \ root\" DOESN'T come from the definition of area &ndash; that's engineer talk.\
      \ Area just HAPPENS to nicely fit with squares and square roots.\n\n'''Dirk\
      \ Fist:''' As far as I know the first use of square roots as a concept is the\
      \ pythagorean theorium  http://www.ies.co.jp/math/java/geo/pythasvn/pythasvn.html\
      \ Hence the definition of square root does come from the definition of area.\
      \ As far as complex width or other quantities, you say the definition was extended\
      \ because it was neccessary, therefore there are real world properties for which\
      \ these numbers apply. It is also obvious that rather than answer the question,\
      \ you have responded by essentially saying that it cannot be understood.  \n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' Again, don't confuse the ''application'' of maths to the real\
      \ world with the ''abstract'' nature of maths. The notion of area may have originally\
      \ inspired the notion of multiplication, but not necessarilly. Multiplication\
      \ is just repeated addition. \n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' I'm not confusing the ''application''\
      \ of maths with the ''abstraction''. My Question is NOT how do I use complex\
      \ numbers, there are plenty of formalulae out there for the multiplication,\
      \ division etc. of complex numbers. But so far no one here has demonstrated\
      \ an understanding of them in the ''abstract'', Or for that matter has shown\
      \ a need for them. As far as I can tell they are essentially a thought experiment\
      \ that has gotten out of hand. Another non-euclidean method of handling negative\
      \ roots is the fact that a square root has indeterminate sign (hence &plusmn;\
      \ in front of it) therefore it is equally valid to say that the square of a\
      \ value with indeterminate sign has indeterminate sign. Under this interpretation\
      \ the square root of -1 = &plusmn;1. \n\n'''Tarquin:''' Ok, Dirk and Foxpaw,\
      \ you both need to understand something: ALL of maths is a \"thought experiment\"\
      . It is a purely logical discipline. It often happens to have useful applications.\
      \ Until you can accept this fact, things such as complex numebrs will indeed\
      \ seem incomprehensible to you. And no, it is not \"equalyl valid\" to say a\
      \ square has an inderterminate sign. That is completely wrong.\n\n'''Wormbo:'''\
      \ I'd like to add that complex numbers have quite some very useful applications\
      \ as well. There are cases where calculations with real numbers would actually\
      \ be much more complex than calculations with complex numbers. (Or something...\
      \ o_O)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' yup, things like residue integration. Also, complex\
      \ numbers are used to represent stuff to do with quantum particules, IIRC. If\
      \ you imagine real numbers as a line, and complex numbers as a plane, it just\
      \ means you have more \"elbow room\" to do things in. :D\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Indeed, quantum mechanics would be unthinkable without complex numbers &ndash;\
      \ and without quantum mechanics, modern semiconductor physics wouldn't be thinkable,\
      \ and without modern semiconductor physics, none of us would be able to discuss\
      \ this matter on the Unreal Wiki...\n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' Since ALL maths is nothing\
      \ more than a thought experiment then viewing roots as having indeterminate\
      \ sign IS equally valid. Much like Non-euclidean geometry, in which some of\
      \ the 'LAWS' are assumed to be wrong and the resulting geometries are found\
      \ to be equally valid, with real world applications.  As far as extending numbers\
      \ to multiple dimensions that's what vectors are for, also since in the end\
      \ complex numbers are ALWAYS represented as pairs of real numbers ANY application\
      \ of complex numbers can be accomplished EQUALLY well with real numbers. And\
      \ still no one can say what the shape of X*X + Y*Y = -5 is ? Or how many dimensions\
      \ that shape would occupy ?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Dirk, you still don't get it.\
      \ Complex numbers extend numbers because parts of the numbers system are \"\
      missing\" until you put them in: the real numbers are not complete, exactly\
      \ ''because'' -1 has no square root. The notion of complex numbers follows on\
      \ from the basic axioms of number theory. You're right about non-euclidean geometry,\
      \ but you're not really putting things together properly: to avoid having complex\
      \ numbers, you'd need to make changes at a much lower level. And complex numbers\
      \ are \"sort of\" like vectors in one way, but really, they're not at all. Vectors\
      \ don't solve problems about numbers, they are a layer on top of them. Now I\
      \ could really blow your mind and tell you that you can have vectors defined\
      \ ''over'' complex numbers.... :D I suggest you go and learn more about the\
      \ subject before you generalize things you don't seem to fully understand. Frankly,\
      \ you're bugging me, you're being n00bish and you're bordering on trolling.\
      \ (And X*X + Y*Y = -5 is a 4-dimensional shape, if you're defining X and Y to\
      \ be in the domain of complex numbers. 4-dimensional shapes are useful, don't\
      \ knock em.)\n\n'''Ironblayde:''' Wow, I just found this page for the first\
      \ time. One hell of a rant. I just want to suggest to Dirk, that talking about\
      \ complex numbers as being distinct from real numbers isn't really accurate.\
      \ Complex numbers aren't a completely separate entity, but a generalization.\
      \ They constitute a larger set of numbers which ''includes'' the real numbers\
      \ as a subset. (Any real number x is the complex number c = x + 0i.) Saying\
      \ that complex numbers are useless when we already have real numbers is like\
      \ saying that rational numbers are useless because we already have integers.\
      \ Also your analogy to non-Euclidean geometries isn't really appropriate either.\
      \ Non-Euclidean geometries arise from replacing Euclid's parallel postulate\
      \ with a slightly different version... but that postulate (that given a line\
      \ L and a point P not on L, there exists exactly one line through P parallel\
      \ to L) is a statement that ''cannot be proven''. Replacing such a thing with\
      \ a different assumption is a little different than just redefining a well-established\
      \ term like a square root to mean what you want it to mean.\n\nOn the original\
      \ topic (as if anyone remembers the original topic by now :)), I agree completely.\
      \ I'm new to UnrealEd so I haven't seen people making the particular comments\
      \ Tarquin referred to, but I've seen plenty of people new to game programming\
      \ in general say similar things. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've tried\
      \ and failed to talk a would-be hobbyist programmer out of trying to code a\
      \ 3D engine when he doesn't even know what a pointer is. :rolleyes: Too many\
      \ people out there worry so much about expanding the ''breadth'' of their knowledge\
      \ as quickly as possible that they forget to be concerned with the ''depth''\
      \ of what they know, and then they're surprised when the whole pile collapses\
      \ at the first sign of trouble.\n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' If you will refer back you\
      \ will see I never claimed to understand them. Sorry for being Noobish. On the\
      \ [[Legacy:Quaternion|Quaternion]] page quaternions are described as 4 dimensional\
      \ complex numbers with two additional roots for -1 (j and k). Additionally it\
      \ states that the multiplication of two quaternions is the combination of the\
      \ rotations specified by the quaternions. So how do you meaningfully multiply\
      \ i*j, i*k, j*k ? It is obvious that i,j and k are perpendicular (otherwise\
      \ they would disappear in the sum). \n\n'''Ironblayde:''' For multiplying the\
      \ three imaginary units, i*j = -j*i = k, j*k = -k*j = i, k*i = -i*k = j. So\
      \ what you said was right; for example, if you think about i, j, and k being\
      \ unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes, respectively, their cross products\
      \ evaluate as above.\n\n[[Legacy:Quaternion|Quaternion]]s are a great application\
      \ of complex numbers that are, as far as I know, used pretty often in computer\
      \ graphics. In addition to not suffering from the problem of gimbal lock as\
      \ the aforementioned page points out, they're also well-suited for interpolating\
      \ between two orientations, e.g. getting a camera to follow a smooth path.\n\
      \n'''Dirk Fist:''' One of the things that bugs me though is that if this was\
      \ a four component vector you would still have a cross product without the special\
      \ treatment for the ''real'' component. It is interesting that the cross product\
      \ of parallel vectors is zero (all terms cancel out) so using vector rules i*i\
      \ = 0 \n\n'''Tarquin:''' remember: vectors and complex numbers are not at all\
      \ the same! Vector are ''on top'' of numbers: they are objects that can be multiplied\
      \ by numbers. Complex numbers are numbers extended to a larger space. There\
      \ are some similarities (depending on hos you look at them), but for things\
      \ like multiplication and products, it does not help at ALL to try to compare\
      \ them.\n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' Actually complex numbers are just as much ''on top\
      \ of'' numbers as vectors. Since the alternative is that X*X + Y*Y = -5 is an\
      \ equation in two dimensions (X,Y) where the dimensions ''just happen'' to be\
      \ two dimensional. Also [[Wikipedia:complex number]] lists complex numbers as\
      \ a special case matrices  which is a special case of [[Wikipedia:Linear algebra]]\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' Except that in the example above it would actually be <tt>(a\
      \ + bi) * (a + bi) + (d + ei) * (d + ei)</tt> (unless you prefer using j I guess).\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' Dirk, the notion of vector space can be applied to many things.\
      \ You can choose to write negative numbers as an ordered pair of positives (a,b)\
      \ with b > a if you like &ndash; that makes negative numbers vectors over the\
      \ positives (to a certain extent &ndash; the axioms fail because it's not a\
      \ field). Stop thinking of vectors as a physical concept; that is only one aplication\
      \ of them. A vector is an object that you can multiply by a number: that's what\
      \ I mean by vectors being \"over\" numbers. Many things can be considered as\
      \ vectors, not just spatial vectors used in applied maths. The analogy between\
      \ complex numbers and vectors breaks down when you consider multiplicaiton.\
      \ At this point, you have to think of complex numbers as just an enlargement\
      \ of numbers rather than sitting over them.\n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' X*X + Y*Y =\
      \ -5 is an equation in two unkowns it only becomes four unkowns if you CONVERT\
      \ the complex numbers to pairs of ordinary numbers in which case it becomes\
      \ the equation a*a+2*a*b*i-b*b+d*d+2*e*d*i-e*e = -5 which can be seperated into\
      \ the pair of equations (a*a+d*d) - (b*b+e*e) = -5 and a*b+e*d = 0 now at this\
      \ point a, b,d or e could be complex, which makes the dimensions of this equation\
      \ potentially infinite. \n\n'''Tarquin:''' WHAT??? You can't do that! When you\
      \ decompose a complex # into two reals, they are REALs. You can't then say \"\
      oh, they might be complex\". Come on. It's stuff like this that makes me think\
      \ you're just trolling. If you're this confused about how maths works, go ask\
      \ a teacher or get a book. You could go read [[Wikipedia:Fundamental theorem\
      \ of algebra]] but it'll probably worry yyou even more ... :D\n\n'''Dirk Fist:'''\
      \ So your saying that once you decompose them into reals the square root of\
      \ -1 no longer has a solution ? \n\n'''Darwedu:''' No. Complex numbers don't\
      \ stop existing, but you know a,b,d and e are NOT complex. You divided the complex\
      \ equation into two real equations, and both real equations DON'T have complex\
      \ coefficients.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Go read something like http://library.thinkquest.org/20991/alg2/cn.html\
      \ and STOP TROLLING, Dirk.\n\n'''Mortal Monkey:''' So is ±5 != 5 then?\n\n'''AlphaOne:'''\
      \ ±5 is two numbers as in the root of x^2=25. It can also bea range of numbers,\
      \ which is used in error/precision notation.\n\n'''Mortal Monkey:''' An example:\n\
      \nLet's say X = 5². We would then know that sqrt(X) = 5, not ±5, because 5 is\
      \ positive. <br />Now let's also assume X = Z². We don't know wether Z is positive\
      \ or negative, therefore sqrt(X) = ±Z. <br />Now what happens if someone else\
      \ later tells us that Z = 5? <br />5 = sqrt(X) = ±5\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I don't\
      \ think that SQRT(5²) is 5. To my knowledge, the \"solution\" would be the complete\
      \ set of numbers that satisfy the equation. So it would still be ±5. Or so says\
      \ my Calculus professor.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' \"square root\" is a 2-valued function,\
      \ so yes, the answer is ±5, or just \"5 and -5\". But \"SQRT\" in computing\
      \ is by convention \"the positive of the two square roots\", so it's just 5.\
      \ Likewise the root sign &ndash; that also means the positive one, which is\
      \ why you have to write ±√x in formalae to mean both roots. See [[Wikipedia:square\
      \ root]].\n\n'''Mortal Monkey:''' You are, ofcourse, both correct. Therefore,\
      \ It is my conclusion that you cannot use common sense in mathmatics.\n\nPS:\
      \ My connection seems to be acting up, wikipedia keeps giving me 404s. Anyway,\
      \ how does a power function work? Because (±5)² does not produce {25, 25}, does\
      \ it?\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I ''believe'' that it does, though since one of the 25s\
      \ is redundant it could be reduced to just 25. Though I think that if it were\
      \ ±5 cubed, the solution set would be ±125\n\n'''Tarquin:''' \"±5\" isn't a\
      \ number you can then do further calculations, without keeping in mind that\
      \ you're really dealing with two possibilities. Do the stupid questions never\
      \ cease?\n\n'''Mortal Monkey:''' Is the moon made of cheese?\n\n'''WheatPuppet:'''\
      \ I'm really tempted to add a \"Refactor_Me\" to the bottom of the page. Don't\
      \ make me do it! ;)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Please do. The whole complex number debate\
      \ just irritates me. Wipe it!\n\n'''dataangel:''' Dude, it gets worse. It's\
      \ not necessarily that these people didn't pay attention in math. In my trig\
      \ class all we learned about matrices was that a^-1*b can gives you a solution\
      \ to a system of 3 equations. That's as deep as it ever got, and that's still\
      \ all I know (although I'm learning). But it can get way worse. Highschool math\
      \ teachers are often seriously lacking.\n\n'''Recondite''' Lol, makes me feel\

      \ was horrible. Noone ever really explained what f(x) meant in reasonable terms\

      \n'''dataangel:''' I'd definitely be willing to help. [http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Trigonometry]\

      \ saw this page before :D  In my school system, Trig was 11th or 12th grade\
      \ material, and vectors were things that you didn't get until college.  I also\
      \ managed to fail Trig twice in high school, and again in my one year in college,\
      \ I think because simply put, no one had at all a convincing reason as to what\
      \ one would ever actually use the stuff for.  Since I've been thinking about\
      \ that over the last couple weeks, as I've been learning some of the more useful\
      \ vector functions, I actually called my high school math teacher, and asked\
      \ him to give me an example where in the real world, someone would actually\
      \ use Trig .. the only thing he could come up with was rocketry and aeronautics.\
      \  On that note, I still haven't seen where I would use Trig anywhere in here\

      \ otherwise laboriously have to \"work around\" without even noticing that you're\
      \ \"working around\" something (\"My, that's a complicated problem!\") by having\
      \ only less-qualified tools at your disposal.  I'm not surprised the teacher\
      \ couldn't come up with a \"real-life example\"; that's like asking where one\
      \ might ''ever'' see the color \"BlanchedAlmond\" [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colornames.asp]\

      \ labor and perhaps even money, and you might end up living in a crooked hut\
      \ because you just couldn't think of a way to tackle a problem others would\
      \ find simple and straightforward to solve with the ''right tools''.\n\n'''Tgusagalpa:'''\

      \  If you paid attention in algebra and geometry, then trig is algebra + geometry.\n\
      \n'''MythOpus:''' I just finished High School a little over a month ago and\
      \ I've come out with a few things to discuss, I suppose.  \n\nI've been learning\
      \ Trignometry ever since Grade 1, just not all at once.  I feel as far as maths\
      \ (and probably even sciences go) they really neglect its complexity for anyone\
      \ under College level maths.  Because I've been working with UnrealScript since\
      \ my later years in Elementary (I think!?) I've been blessed with the knowledge\
      \ of what a matrix is, what a vector is and most of the terminology involved.\
      \  Matrices are only ever touched in one math class for about 2 weeks to a month\
      \ and they rarely go in-depth as to why things are the way they are.  From grade\
      \ 9 and on I've tried to ask a lot of questions, at my classmates dismay, that\
      \ tried to give clarity to those deeper issues but the teachers tries extremely\
      \ hard to not give me a very good answer for fear of confusing the class or\
      \ me or perhaps they never even had a good way to explain it because it would\
      \ require a University level of math history.  They stay away from the complex\
      \ issues surrounding math and its applications and while in the general scheme\
      \ of things it lets the majority who apply themselves get good grades and it\
      \ even lets some of the people who don't apply themselves at all get decent\
      \ grades.  Anyways, the point is I don't think we put much faith in the young\
      \ in understanding anything remotely complex.  In Calculus and C30, I wanted\
      \ to know how a lot of things would work with the actual addition of the Z-axis.\
      \  In, I believe B30, some people didn't even know that there was a Z-axis involved\
      \ and a question that I asked the teacher he actually just told me to come talk\
      \ to him after class because he said it would throw the entire class off.  In\
      \ Grade 4, we learned Multiplication.  What we actually did was memorize a multiplication\
      \ chart and while it probably did us some good to know what things multiplied\
      \ to instead of understand the actual theory behind it, I feel it would have\
      \ prepared us more if he did less memorizing and more learning.  I understand\
      \ that its sometimes good to generalize and dumb things down to ensure that\
      \ everyone understands it, and even some people who don't have the brain for\
      \ mathematics and \"out of bounds\" thinking struggle with the most basic stuff,\
      \ I feel we should more than just introduce certain aspects of math to students.\n\
      \nDon't get me wrong there are 'special' programs for these 'higher' kinds of\
      \ math such as the International Baccelaureate (or however you spell it) programs\
      \ but those are seen as programs only for \"smart\" people.  What I saw more\
      \ that came out that program was people who were I'd hate to say it, either\
      \ extremely snobby thinking that they are better than anyone who isn't in the\
      \ program, or were extremely helpful (and also confusing to those being helped\
      \ on some occasions) to people in need.  The snobby aspect was seen mostly though\
      \ and I think its needless.  The math that they are taught isn't too far over\
      \ the math that everyone else took and if one was confused with what they were\
      \ being taught, it would only be because they didn't go indepth in the topics\
      \ that they covered through Elementary and High School.  My calculus teacher\
      \ was an IB teacher himself and he taught us pretty much the same way he did\
      \ his IB courses where he would go through a few sheets of paper a bit with\
      \ us and go through some examples and some questions he would answer about as\
      \ he was teaching us but a lot of the time if he felt the answer took some class\
      \ out he would get us to come him, but the point is with that is that the questions\
      \ and answer were usually not above the class and he made time to answer these\
      \ questions.  We were left to figure things out pretty much on our own instead\
      \ of having our had held the entire way through our learning experience.  Some\
      \ things I said probably overlapped negatively with other things I said but\
      \ this is more of a rant so my thoughts on it are probably not too well thought\
      \ out.\n\nWhen I started to work a bit with the actual vectors in UScript I\
      \ did a lot of guesswork even after reading a little material on the subject.\
      \  I understand that it isn't the job of Elementary or High School teachers\
      \ to prepare their students for 3d object manipulation and other such things\
      \ but, it would have been nice to learn about geometry in not 2 but 3 dimensions\
      \ at least introductorily.  Perhaps they should cover other advanced topics\
      \ very briefly in math/science classes (we got the 2 dimensions treatment in\
      \ Physics 20 and 30...) which will lead up to optional 'advanced' classes such\
      \ as Calculus that would go over, indepth, those advanced topics.  It could\
      \ just be that UScript vectors are set up wierdly, that I'm not sure about,\
      \ but it was slightly confusing walking around in the world of vectors for the\
      \ first time.  And rotators... I was FAR too afraid to touch those at that point.\
      \  And about the arguments about picking up a book and reading it, for at least\
      \ me, asking a teacher about a good math book for that sort of stuff was like\
      \ going to... um...  A CIA Agent and asking them how to do some of their advanced\
      \ stuff, whatever that may be, that they do.  The teacher hesitated, or laughed,\
      \ maybe even tried to suggest a book but wasn't really sure they would.  I don't\
      \ think there were (mind you I never REALLY looked) any 'advanced' math books\
      \ in our library and if we did the terminology used would probably have thrown\
      \ me off.  I even had the privelage of 'helping' my cousin in University for\
      \ a bit with vectors but didn't turn out too well because her assignments were\
      \ due faster then I could understand her textbook and work out the questions.\
      \  The terminology was just so different from what I was used to and the way\
      \ they worked with Matrices was so 'odd'.  Going down to the actual library\
      \ was sort of out of bounds for me too because the Librarians would most likely\
      \ not know about that stuff and what books would be great to learn this or that.\
      \  I wouldn't know where to start.  I think thats all I'll say about that for\
      \ right now.  Sorry if it sounds a bit off-topic but after reading a bit of\
      \ this page I got the urge to write my views on the Educational system with\
      \ regards to math... which slightly touches on Trignometry and a students understanding\
      \ of it...\n\n[[Category:Legacy Text Mangling Alert|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n[[Category:Legacy\
