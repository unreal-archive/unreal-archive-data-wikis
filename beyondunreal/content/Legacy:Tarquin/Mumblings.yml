      \ post their tutorials on the Wiki as their first choice is probably because\
      \ they are only remotely acquainted with it; usually the people writing tutorials\
      \ have much less inclination to visit a site like the Unreal Wiki to <i>obtain</i>\
      \ information. It would be interesting though to directly ask Rachel, for example,\

      \ The straightforward way to extract information usually works best.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ You know me too well, Mych! time for another round of plastic surgery&#160;;)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Do write that email asking Rachel though. Would be interesting\
      \ to read what she replies.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> *points to Mych* you're\
      \ the diplomatic one&#160;:) any thoughts on how to encourage more WikiGardening\
      \ &amp; less lurkage? I'm hoping Wiki tags will encourage people a bit ... what\
      \ about a \"Request for import\" wikitag, eg on <a href=\"/Legacy:AssaultPath\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:AssaultPath\">AssaultPath</a>? what do you think?</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ With reference to the contributor to lurkage ratio - my thoughts on this are\
      \ as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many websites allow you to actually change\
      \ the content on a page? Almost none (the Wiki's are the only ones I know of).\
      \ This coupled with people's natural ability to avoid reading information presented\
      \ to them means that a fair number of people simply don't know they can contribute.</li>\n\
      <li>There's too much \"repesct\" on the Wiki for each other's contributions.\
      \ If I write a piece on the Wiki and someone finds an error, the error will\
      \ very rarely be fixed. Instead they'll put a thread in the page pointing to\
      \ the error. This leads to the threadage problem we have. So much of IT is about\
      \ IP that the very idea of being able to change whatever you want is an almost\
      \ alien concept.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd>As an aside, why not release a \"press\
      \ release\" asking for feedback on why people don't contribute? There was one\
      \ guy on the Devastation forum who said that he'd not found the Wiki much use\
      \ because the information on it assumed too much knowledge. I did ask him why\
      \ he didn't become a contributor but he avoided the question. Given that the\
      \ Devastation modding community (as tiny as it is) seems to be very new to the\
      \ Unreal Engine there could be an opportunity to get a handle on the \"basic\
      \ info\" we appear to be lacking. I'll probably make a post (or two) in the\
      \ Dev. forums to give people a prod and see what gives.\n<dl>\n<dd><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ I made the post and you can see it here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\

      \ how useful it is particularly - but I'm not really sure what I was expecting.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>GRAF!K:</b> Yes, I agree, Tarquin. The wiki is in\
      \ a bit of a fix. But perhaps the way we're approaching the problem is part\
      \ of the problem: For example: If your home was half torn apart by a hurricane,\
      \ would you replace each 2x4, pipe, etc. as necessary? or would a new house\
      \ be in order? Perhaps we should rebuild the wiki (off a seperate link from\
      \ the home).</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> If it's a nice house, yeah&#160;:) I'm\
      \ feeling more positive about it now. The clean-up is going well&#160;:D even\
      \ if only a relatively small number of people are helping.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ There was no hurricane in the Unreal Wiki – just a lot of people who didn't\
      \ dot their \"i\"s and cross their \"t\"s for an extended length of time. If\
      \ we started over with no change in our approach, the very same would happen.</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>It is <b>not</b> a good idea to create a page just to put a statement\
      \ on it that it should be created with some <i>real</i> information.</li>\n\
      <li>It is <b>not</b> a good idea to put a hint \"Refactor this!\" on a page.\
      \ Either do it yourself or leave it alone.</li>\n<li>It is <b>not</b> a good\
      \ idea to add a bit of information as a comment. Make sure that the information\
      \ is <i>correct</i>, then add it in the document itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And,\
      \ lastly, my pet peeve, additions that look like their author was in an incredible\
      \ hurry – unable to start a sentence with a capital letter, unable to close\
      \ it with a punctuation mark, and probably with one or two typos thrown in for\
      \ good measure.</p>\n<p><b>GRAF!K:</b> Sorry Mych. You're right, I was in an\
      \ incredible hurry - I wasn't on my own computer and was kicked off as I frantically\
      \ attempted to finish my sentence.&#160;;-)</p>\n<p>That page was intended to\
      \ be much longer once I got back online, and (in the event my suggestion became\
      \ a reality) hold the new, reworked index.</p>\n<p>As for the hurricane bit,\
      \ when UT2003 released, IMO that was a considerable 'hurricane' that hit the\
      \ wiki. Things were not seperated between UT and 2K3 as well as they could have\
      \ been.</p>\n<p>Question: Is it okay to refactor Developer Journals? Or are\
      \ they considered more of a 'hideout'?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I'm really happy\
      \ with some of the work done lately. The rewrite of <a href=\"/Legacy:Zoning\"\

      <p>(2 September 2002)</p>\n<p>Arg! I've just realised why this whole endeavour\
      \ will always in some way be running water uphill. Some time ago I read something\
      \ about \"how to post noob questions\". I think it was linked to from one of\
      \ the BuF forums. There was the usual:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>phrase your questions\
      \ clearly</li>\n<li>give some indication that you've tried to solve the problem\
      \ yourself – that you don't just want a free ride</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there\
      \ was also a bit about why the knowledgeable hang out in forums answering questions\
      \ in the first place – status. If you <i>have</i> knowledge, giving it to others\
      \ is a form of benevolent power. However, once you've given it all away, you\
      \ no longer have the power or the status. (this is a well-known factor in complex\
      \ government bureaucracies. Take the scene in <i>The 12 tasks of Asterix</i>,\
      \ for example.)</p>\n<p>So you either need an influx of newbies who are in <i>awe</i>\
      \ at your knowledge, or you need to ensure that you're always a step ahead.</p>\n\
      <p>What bugged me into starting the place was that after so many years of Unreal\
      \ editing, with hundreds of people gaining working knowledge of the engine,\
      \ finding information was still often a matter of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hey, how do\
      \ I do X?</li>\n<li>er, try A.</li>\n<li>no, that don't work</li>\n<li>try B!</li>\n\
      <li>hey, this is a great tute.</li>\n<li>that's the last version of UEd. Try\
      \ this tute.</li>\n<li>I followed the tute but it doesn't work. help!</li>\n\
      <li>well, send me the map and I'll try to fix it</li>\n<li>thank you, u r a\
      \ god!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You'd think that after x years, it would <i>all</i> have\
      \ been said, <i>somewhere</i>. But why? That would mean that no-one would hold\
      \ the keys to the information.</p>\n<p>Having said that, there are a LOT of\
      \ experts writing on this wiki: people who realise that <i>knowledge</i> is\
      \ not the same thing as <i>intelligence</i> and <i>talent</i>. No matter how\
      \ much of your knowledge you share, if you have talent and intelligence you\
      \ still have the status, should you want it.</p>\n<p><b>Kuhal:</b> Why does\
      \ one donate to a worthy charity? There is no reward other than the knowledge\
      \ that you have done a good thing. Perhaps a smile or thankyou from the person/body\
      \ you donated to. It's not (usually) as if donations directly save lives in\
      \ the sense that an trauma room doctor saves lives.</p>\n<p>Although I'm a newcomer,\
      \ I've come to enjoy reading the recent updates (and especially topics like\
      \ this) so if nothing else. it's a nice place to hang out. Better than 99% of\
      \ forums because there's no boring flame tolerated.</p>\n<p>I've started embedding\
      \ links to topics in here as I've seen you and Mychael and others doing so I\
      \ believe your efforts are not going to waste! You <b>are</b> pushing water\
      \ uphill, only there is a hell of a lot <b>more</b> water now than before you\
      \ started because through your efforts and the efforts of the contributors,\
      \ people are coming up to speed faster than ever before. Less beginners are\
      \ giving up early because of the wealth of experience expressed in pages like\

      \ So, at the beginning, it might be good for you to link over there. However,\
      \ as time moves on, users may write tutorials over here that are much more in-depth\
      \ than the UDN ones, as there are hundreds more people working on this kind\

      \ will be comprehensive enough to answer all the questions, and there will always\
      \ be some people who want to go it alone with their tutorials. The single biggest\
      \ advantage the Wiki has over all of them is that it changes, adapts, and grows\
      \ on a daily basis. There is <i>always</i> new information on the Wiki to look\
      \ at, and the random page feature is a blast. The only possible danger to the\

      \ thought would be mere coincidence. They may also be out of date...''\n\n==Epic\
      \ hires==\n\n(12 feb 2005)\n\nOk, so is it me, or am I pretty well qualified\
      \ for this job?\n\n{{innerbox| Epic Games has an immediate opening for a full-time\
      \ manager of all technical support and documentation for the Unreal Engine.\
      \  This full-time position requires a combination of technical, writing, organizational,\
      \ and managerial skills.  Tasks will include interfacing with engine licensees\
      \ to determine documentation needs, surveying and maintaining our external documentation\
      \ website (http://udn.epicgames.com), and working with programmers and content\
      \ developers to create new documentation.  Depending on workload, this position\
      \ may also involve supervision and maintenance of other Epic websites, including\
      \ http://www.epicgames.com  and http://www.unreal.com .\n\n}}\n\nUnfortunately,\
      \ it's on the other side of the Atlantic, I'm busy with something else up to\
      \ the end of the year, and I'm not sure I can or want to go live in the states.\
      \ hmm....\n\n==Over the hill ==\n\n(2 April 2003)\n\nI think we're past it guys.\
      \ I'm quite worried about it. I think we are now on part 13 of the [[MeatBall:WikiLifeCycle]]:\n\
      \n: 13: [[Wiki:WikiSuccessCanInhibitNewWriters]] -> stagnation of contribution\n\
      \nOur problems are:\n* too much damn [[MeatBall:ThreadMode]]\n* too much damn\
      \ mess\n* too many pages say \"to be updated for UT2003\"\n* we have a bad lurkage-to-writing\
      \ ratio\n* we have a LOUSY writing-to-tidying ratio\n* the \"must-read\" tutorials\
      \ are on other sides &ndash; writers like Hourences and Rachel don't come here\n\
      \nAll in all, I'm starting to think that ''this is it''. I asked for help in\
      \ cleaning the place up, and a few people said \"yeah great\" but not many people\
      \ actually ''did'' something. I realised I dind't exactly give clear instructions\
      \ and hoped people would make their own decisions. So I've made a clear list\
      \ on [[Legacy:UnrealWiki To Do|UnrealWiki To Do]]. But ''that'' feels more like\
      \ the action of a [[MeatBall:GodKing]], which I don't want to be.\n\n: How is\
      \ asking people to do something abusing your power as system administrator?\
      \ That is the total antithesis of being a god king. &ndash; SunirShah\n\nWikis\
      \ don't run themselves, guys. We badly need some [[MeatBall:BarnRaising]], or\
      \ we're going under.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I would be more concerned if you wouldn't\
      \ be writing something along those lines every six months or so (see entries\
      \ below on this page).  :-)\n\nWhy some people still don't post their tutorials\
      \ on the Wiki as their first choice is probably because they are only remotely\
      \ acquainted with it; usually the people writing tutorials have much less inclination\
      \ to visit a site like the Unreal Wiki to ''obtain'' information.  It would\
      \ be interesting though to directly ask Rachel, for example, why she chose to\
      \ post her tutorials on a read-only site instead of the Wiki.  The straightforward\
      \ way to extract information usually works best.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' You know\
      \ me too well, Mych! time for another round of plastic surgery ;)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Do write that email asking Rachel though.  Would be interesting to read what\
      \ she replies.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' *points to Mych* you're the diplomatic one\
      \ :) any thoughts on how to encourage more WikiGardening & less lurkage? I'm\
      \ hoping Wiki tags will encourage people a bit ... what about a \"Request for\
      \ import\" wikitag, eg on [[Legacy:AssaultPath|AssaultPath]]? what do you think?\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' With reference to the contributor to lurkage ratio - my\
      \ thoughts on this are as follows.\n* How many websites allow you to actually\
      \ change the content on a page?  Almost none (the Wiki's are the only ones I\
      \ know of).  This coupled with people's natural ability to avoid reading information\
      \ presented to them means that a fair number of people simply don't know they\
      \ can contribute.\n* There's too much \"repesct\" on the Wiki for each other's\
      \ contributions.  If I write a piece on the Wiki and someone finds an error,\
      \ the error will very rarely be fixed.  Instead they'll put a thread in the\
      \ page pointing to the error.  This leads to the threadage problem we have.\
      \  So much of IT is about IP that the very idea of being able to change whatever\
      \ you want is an almost alien concept.\n: As an aside, why not release a \"\
      press release\" asking for feedback on why people don't contribute?  There was\
      \ one guy on the Devastation forum who said that he'd not found the Wiki much\
      \ use because the information on it assumed too much knowledge.  I did ask him\
      \ why he didn't become a contributor but he avoided the question.  Given that\
      \ the Devastation modding community (as tiny as it is) seems to be very new\
      \ to the Unreal Engine there could be an opportunity to get a handle on the\
      \ \"basic info\" we appear to be lacking.  I'll probably make a post (or two)\
      \ in the Dev. forums to give people a prod and see what gives.\n::'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ I made the post and you can see it here: http://www.devastationgame.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1497.\
      \  Don't know how useful it is particularly - but I'm not really sure what I\
      \ was expecting.\n\n'''GRAF!K:''' Yes, I agree, Tarquin. The wiki is in a bit\
      \ of a fix. But perhaps the way we're approaching the problem is part of the\
      \ problem: For example: If your home was half torn apart by a hurricane, would\
      \ you replace each 2x4, pipe, etc. as necessary? or would a new house be in\
      \ order? Perhaps we should rebuild the wiki (off a seperate link from the home).\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' If it's a nice house, yeah :) I'm feeling more positive about\
      \ it now. The clean-up is going well :D even if only a relatively small number\
      \ of people are helping. \n\n'''Mychaeel:''' There was no hurricane in the Unreal\
      \ Wiki &ndash; just a lot of people who didn't dot their \"i\"s and cross their\
      \ \"t\"s for an extended length of time.  If we started over with no change\
      \ in our approach, the very same would happen.\n* It is '''not''' a good idea\
      \ to create a page just to put a statement on it that it should be created with\
      \ some ''real'' information.\n* It is '''not''' a good idea to put a hint \"\
      Refactor this!\" on a page.  Either do it yourself or leave it alone.\n* It\
      \ is '''not''' a good idea to add a bit of information as a comment.  Make sure\
      \ that the information is ''correct'', then add it in the document itself.\n\
      \nAnd, lastly, my pet peeve, additions that look like their author was in an\
      \ incredible hurry &ndash; unable to start a sentence with a capital letter,\
      \ unable to close it with a punctuation mark, and probably with one or two typos\
      \ thrown in for good measure.\n\n'''GRAF!K:''' Sorry Mych. You're right, I was\
      \ in an incredible hurry - I wasn't on my own computer and was kicked off as\
      \ I frantically attempted to finish my sentence. ;-)\n\nThat page was intended\
      \ to be much longer once I got back online, and (in the event my suggestion\
      \ became a reality) hold the new, reworked index.\n\nAs for the hurricane bit,\
      \ when UT2003 released, IMO that was a considerable 'hurricane' that hit the\
      \ wiki. Things were not seperated between UT and 2K3 as well as they could have\
      \ been. \n\nQuestion: Is it okay to refactor Developer Journals? Or are they\
      \ considered more of a 'hideout'? \n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'm really happy with some\
      \ of the work done lately. The rewrite of [[Legacy:Zoning|Zoning]] & the refactoring\
      \ of stuff into [[Legacy:Map Optimization|Map Optimization]] for example: they\
      \ read like proper pages, with good explanations, links etc. [[Legacy:UnrealScript\
      \ Lessons|UnrealScript Lessons]] is sharpening up too. I'm still a bit disappointed\
      \ that so few people are helping out with the cleanup. I don't think the people\
      \ who already are helping should do more &ndash; we need more people to do a\
      \ little bit.\n\n==Who am I kidding? ==\n\n(2 September 2002)\n\nArg! I've just\
      \ realised why this whole endeavour will always in some way be running water\
      \ uphill. Some time ago I read something about \"how to post noob questions\"\
      . I think it was linked to from one of the BuF forums. There was the usual:\n\
      * phrase your questions clearly\n* give some indication that you've tried to\
      \ solve the problem yourself &ndash; that you don't just want a free ride\n\n\
      And there was also a bit about why the knowledgeable hang out in forums answering\
      \ questions in the first place &ndash; status. If you ''have'' knowledge, giving\
      \ it to others is a form of benevolent power. However, once you've given it\
      \ all away, you no longer have the power or the status. (this is a well-known\
      \ factor in complex government bureaucracies. Take the scene in ''The 12 tasks\
      \ of Asterix'', for example.)\n\nSo you either need an influx of newbies who\
      \ are in ''awe'' at your knowledge, or you need to ensure that you're always\
      \ a step ahead.\n\nWhat bugged me into starting the place was that after so\
      \ many years of Unreal editing, with hundreds of people gaining working knowledge\
      \ of the engine, finding information was still often a matter of:\n* hey, how\
      \ do I do X?\n* er, try A.\n* no, that don't work\n* try B!\n* hey, this is\
      \ a great tute.\n* that's the last version of UEd. Try this tute.\n* I followed\
      \ the tute but it doesn't work. help!\n* well, send me the map and I'll try\
      \ to fix it\n* thank you, u r a god!\n\nYou'd think that after x years, it would\
      \ ''all'' have been said, ''somewhere''. But why? That would mean that no-one\
      \ would hold the keys to the information. \n\nHaving said that, there are a\
      \ LOT of experts writing on this wiki: people who realise that ''knowledge''\
      \ is not the same thing as ''intelligence'' and ''talent''. No matter how much\
      \ of your knowledge you share, if you have talent and intelligence you still\
      \ have the status, should you want it.\n\n'''Kuhal:''' Why does one donate to\
      \ a worthy charity?  There is no reward other than the knowledge that you have\
      \ done a good thing.  Perhaps a smile or thankyou from the person/body you donated\
      \ to.  It's not (usually) as if donations directly save lives in the sense that\
      \ an trauma room doctor saves lives.  \n\nAlthough I'm a newcomer, I've come\
      \ to enjoy reading the recent updates (and especially topics like this) so if\
      \ nothing else. it's a nice place to hang out.  Better than 99% of forums because\
      \ there's no boring flame tolerated.  \n\nI've started embedding links to topics\
      \ in here as I've seen you and Mychael and others doing so I believe your efforts\
      \ are not going to waste!  You '''are''' pushing water uphill, only there is\
      \ a hell of a lot '''more''' water now than before you started because through\
      \ your efforts and the efforts of the contributors, people are coming up to\
      \ speed faster than ever before.  Less beginners are giving up early because\
      \ of the wealth of experience expressed in pages like these...  (Man I am in\
      \ a rant mood today - lol)\n\n==Future of the Site ==\n\n: '''22 June 2002'''\n\
      \nThis is probably just inspired by low blood sugar, but I'm having doubts about\
      \ the future of the site. I was pondering whether to email [[Legacy:Fordy|Fordy]]\
      \ to ask him if we can import his list of new engine features ( http://www.planetunreal.com/fordy/newutengine.htm\
      \ ) to [[Legacy:New Features In UT200X|New Features In UT200X]], so we can hit\
      \ the ground running amd quickly cover new things once we get our hands on the\
      \ new Ed...\n\nBut if UT2K3 ships with a full manual, the UDN is opened up to\
      \ the general public AND there's a book published too, I'm wondering if we're\
      \ still useful.\n\n:'''Hugh:''' I think that linking both way could be a good\
      \ thing - the people who write the tutorials over there (myself included) have\
      \ been using the tools for months, and for a while after UT2003 (for example)\
      \ comes out, they will be the most mature tutorials around. So, at the beginning,\
      \ it might be good for you to link over there. However, as time moves on, users\
      \ may write tutorials over here that are much more in-depth than the UDN ones,\
      \ as there are hundreds more people working on this kind of thing. At that stage,\
      \ the situateion would reverse, and UDN may start linking over here.\n\n:'''Dma:'''\
      \  You'll have a fit when you see the class tree.\n\n::'''Tarquin:'''  Why's\
      \ that?\n\n::'''Mychaeel:'''  Not necessarily... but we'll definitely have to\
      \ introduce namespaces or something like that, as discussed in the forum before.\
      \  ([[UT2003:Bot]], for instance, still exists as a class, but it's now a subclass\
      \ of Actor >> Controller >> AI and has a very different meaning than the trusty\
      \ old [[UT:Bot]]...)\n\n::'''Dma:'''  For one thing... The location of [[Legacy:Texture\
      \ (UT)|Texture (UT)]] in UT2K3 (now a subclass of Material).  Also... THEY HAVE\
      \ DEPRECATED THE DECAL CLASS! IT IS HORRIBLE!  HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! GIVE US BACK\
      \ OUR POCKMARKS!\n:::'''Dma:'''  Oh wait.  Decals seem to be replaced by something\
      \ called \"Projectors\".\n\n::::'''Hugh:'''  I think I was about to say something\
      \ about that... Projectors are really powerful. They do pretty much what their\
      \ name says - think of having a slide projector floating in mid-air somewhere\
      \ in your level, projecting a texture onto a wall/floor/whatever. One very nice\
      \ use I've seen for a projector was to make a shadow of a tree on the ground.\n\
      \n:'''Mychaeel:'''  If there was any doubt to that, no more than three publications\
      \ would ever be written on any subject.  :-p\n\n:: '''Tarquin:'''  any colour,\
      \ as long as it's black. Good point though. I think I was starting to worry\
      \ about the middleman syndrome; caught between the Official \"all you'll ever\
      \ need\" sources and the \"homegrown nature's way\" homepages... I suppose the\
      \ positive spin on that is that the Unreal Wiki is '''''both''''' open and homegrown\
      \ AND a comprehensive resource.\n\nOn the other hand, those 3 resources aren't\
      \ going to stop people from writing their own tutorials. Why? Well, the Wiki\
      \ is a fairly complete resource, yet people are still writing tutorials elsewhere.\n\
      \nSigh. It's Charybdis and Scylla. I'm off to eat chocolate.\n\n:'''EntropicLqd'''\
      \ - There will always be people who won't want to buy the book (I bet it'll\
      \ be at least the price of the game).  I doubt the manual that ships with UT2K3\
      \ will be comprehensive enough to answer all the questions, and there will always\
      \ be some people who want to go it alone with their tutorials.  The single biggest\
      \ advantage the Wiki has over all of them is that it changes, adapts, and grows\
      \ on a daily basis.  There is ''always'' new information on the Wiki to look\
      \ at, and the random page feature is a blast.  The only possible danger to the\
      \ Wiki is if it is percieved as breaking copyright with information contained\
      \ within the book.  But then all tutorials would probably fall under that category.\n\
      \n----\n\nT, stop whining. You're the leader. I've learnt that whining gets\
      \ you nowhere because it tells people that things are really just that bad.\
      \ Who wants to work on a project that is falling apart? You know, [[Wiki:FixBrokenWindows]].\
      \ If you stay positive, things will be positive. If you have a problem, follow\
      \ through and do something about it. Don't forget you're the [[MeatBall:RoleModel]].\
      \ &ndash; [[MeatBall:SunirShah]]\n\n: Ouch. consider me slapped, Sunir. I should\
      \ probably just delete this entire page. - T\n\n'''Tarquin:''' [[Legacy:SavannahLion|SavannahLion]]\
      \ has been asking me for advice on setting up a wiki for halflife. So I think\
      \ this page should stay, if only to give other wikihosts an idea of the tribulations...\n\
      \n'''GRAF!K:''' How did you reset the list of edits to this page?\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ I didn't. USeMod cleans up old versions after a while\n\n'''TwelveBaud:'''\
      \ Just put a plea on the wiki home for people to research stuff and clickey\
      \ on the quezzies. I see some UMenu stuff in the Actor Browser; I look on the\
