      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> You can also simply go through the UT200x menu and select\
      \ Host A Game -&gt; DedicatedServer. Then, launch UT200x again and select Join\
      \ A Game -&gt; Your machine (or using <a href=\"/Legacy:Console_Commands\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Console Commands\">Console Commands</a>, \"map 127.0.0.1\"). Does this\
      \ cause a lot of overhead on the Server?</p>\n<p><b>Switch`:</b> Server will\
      \ be affected by resource-hungry apps (ie client, wotgreal, anything) running\
      \ on the same or higher priority. Put server on high priority to avoid that.\
      \ If your hardware is good enough to run a server and your mods arent buggy\
      \ server will use only a small part of the cpu. When starting another client\
      \ put the currently running ones on low priority temporarily to speed up loading\
      \ significantly.</p>\n<p><b>HunterKiller:</b> Have you noticed that UT2004 is\
      \ not allowing to be launched multiple times? At least from the same folder,\
      \ running on Windows XP, whenever I try to start another copy, the running game\
      \ gets focus. I am trying to test a listen server.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ Right. <i>ListenServer</i> means your local machine wants to both be a server\
      \ and a client machine. It won't allow multiple sessions. That's why this Basic\
      \ Procedure talks about running it as a <b>DedicatedServer</b>, which means\
      \ it will only act as a server. At that time, you can run a client session on\
      \ the same machine.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Some things need to be tested on\
      \ a listen server as well, because having a local player on the server can cause\
      \ problems that don't appear in standalone or client/server games.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ Point well taken. So in that case, HK would have to run his ListenServer with\
      \ more than one machine to test, correct?</p>\n<p><b>OlympusMons:</b> Dunno\
      \ if this would work but if you dont have a lan or internet server handy perhaps\
      \ you could try running a copy from 2 different user profiles.</p>\n<p><b>XxDangerxX:</b>\
      \ Is there a way to do this on UT99? I wouldn't want to have to buy an old laptop\
