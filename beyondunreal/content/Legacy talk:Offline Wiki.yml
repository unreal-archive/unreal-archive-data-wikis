      \ various platforms' limitations (no more than 32 characters on the Mac, case-insensitivity\

      \ Sunir got me thinking (over at <a href=\"/Legacy:Project_Copyright/Discussion\"\

      \ some reason several files that only differ in the capitalization of their\
      \ file name are in the \"shared\" directory (for instance, InterWiki-Wikipedia.png\
      \ and InterWiki-Wikipedia.PNG). When extracting the archive under Windows that\

      \ Agreed. We should adopt a standard on only lower-case file types (a.jpg, not\

      \ I take it it was an accident. Hope tarquin sees it. That's why I put that\

      \ Seen. It's because Photoshop puts CAPS extensions, and I forget to change\

      <p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> I thought that you can't have mixed-case in file extensions.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> File extensions are just part of a file name separated from\

      \ not until I found it that I felt like \"mastering unreal\". The offline wiki\
      \ is another cute detail, especially for 56krs like me, or netecofreaks; like\
      \ me&#160;;-) Could I suggest using a solid compression algo, like RAR or Bzip2?\
      \ Documents with repetitive text like headers and sidebars are the ideal meat\
      \ for them. I just tryed it: todays wiki (29,444,530 bytes) shrinks to 42% (12,706,692\
      \ bytes) when zipped; but it gets down to 26% (7,937,234 bytes) using solid\
      \ RAR! That's almost 5 MB less. Even if you made the archive self extracting,\
      \ it would be a lot lighter. Keep up the good work, and count me in, even if\
      \ I spend most of my wiki time on the offline version!</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ We're limited by the compression software that's available on the server.\
      \ We have zip and bzip2 there, but no RAR compression utility (or I'm just bad\
      \ at guessing names). If you could point me to one that runs under Linux, I'll\
      \ ask the BeyondUnreal admins to install it.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> unrar\
      \ is free, rar isn't.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> btw here are some stats:</p>\n\
      <pre>34226176 in total\n12728922 test.zip\n8134137  test.tar.bz2\n8966783  test.tar.gz\n\
      \n</pre>\n<p>bzip2 generates a high system load, gzip doesn't. So I think using\
      \ tar gzip is the best solution.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Sounds like a good\
      \ idea. Is .tgz widely enough supported by Windows archivers to allow us to\
      \ completely scratch the .zip version in favor of a .tgz one?</p>\n<p><b>Mysterial:</b>\
      \ WinZip and WinRAR support it and they're the two most widely used archivers.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Chema:</b> Usually bandwith is more precious ('myyyy preshiouuus'&#160;;-)\
      \ ) than some extra cpu cycles, but bzip2 is indeeded not widely supported in\
      \ Windows: just by WinRAR and, well, bzip2.exe, to my knowledge (WinZip barely\
      \ provides tgz support – just decompression, couse zip provides \"similar functionality\"\
      . haha).</p>\n<p>Well, you could provide both formats, but that means even more\
      \ cycles. But even better would be to have weekly snapshots, that would weight\
      \ a few hundred KBs in tgz. A simple \"find . -ctime 7\" would do the trick;\
      \ well, if your usual script is that simple too.</p>\n<p>But I see there is\
      \ still the zip pack. If I can help writing the stuff, just tell me so (with\
      \ a brief, err, debriefing: sh or perl? target for cron?).</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte\
      \ TDS:</b> I don't know if weekly snapshots are such a good idea, because it\
      \ would require you to download the snapshot everyweek, you can't mis a single\
      \ week or you will have to download the full snapshot again. And the offline\
      \ wiki is only intresting for users without broadband.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Adding support for RAR is a matter of (1) having a RAR compressor for Linux\
      \ and (2) adding a single line of code to the current Offline Wiki (Perl) script.\
      \ My concern is more for BeyondUnreal's bandwidth than the users' in this case;\
      \ right now a single 13 MB-file is uploaded to all mirrors once a day, and each\
      \ compression format we'd provide in addition to that would add to that load\
      \ (multiplied by the number of mirrors, naturally).</p>\n<p><b>Chema:</b> Err,\
      \ you got me wrong: I was talking about bzip2 format, not RAR. Anyway, yes,\
      \ I think that having 2 formats its not elegant (not 'perlish'&#160;;-) ), thats\
      \ why I think the weekly snapshot is much better.</p>\n<p>In response to El\
      \ Muerte, you don't have to get the snapshot every week: I think they should\
      \ be really tiny (100-500KB at most, in tgz? well, not counting when I upload\
      \ my vactaion pics!), and several of them could be stored on the Offline Wiki\
      \ page. So you just need to check your last update, and get the newer snapshots.</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> what about this: \"snapshot on request\" you can select\
      \ the timeframe of the snapshot and then a archive will be created on the fly\
      \ and feeded realtime to your browser&#160;;)</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Hmm...\
      \ maybe that's not even so far off. Executing the Offline Wiki script takes\
      \ several minutes to complete, but that's mostly due to several thousand pages\
      \ that have to be read and formatted. Actually packing a subset of pages into\
      \ a downloadable archive file takes much less time. – However, the problem remains\
      \ that file downloads shouldn't be served directly from a BeyondUnreal-hosted\
      \ site.</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> Gehn, the offline wiki file size does change\
      \ frequently due to constant edits. Thanks for the update.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Offline Wiki is up and running again after it went down April 29, 2004, and\
      \ nobody bothered telling me/us... according to hal from BeyondUnreal, the Perl\
      \ script building the Offline Wiki has been throwing warning messages for quite\
      \ a while, but they chose to ignore them rather than to tell us about them.\
      \ &#160;:-/</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I had no idea...</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b>\
      \ I've put up an readonly mirror of the UnrealWiki <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external text\" href=\"http://unreal.student.utwente.nl/wiki/\">here</a>, it\
      \ uses this offline wiki for it's content. Quite some things don't work (like\
      \ search), and the page naming isn't 1on1, but at least we'll have a fallback\
      \ when BU goes offline again.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> it's broken, the current\
      \ archive is from november 5</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Techno_JF:</b> Just so it's\
      \ clear, the offline wiki hasn't been updated in a while. I don't know if that's\
      \ by accident or by design, but I think people should be aware of it either\
      \ way. I just downloaded it, and the date on the pages said \"Sat, November\
      \ 5, 2005\". For reference, today's date is February 21, 2006.</p>\n<p><b>HC\
      \ Denton:</b> Is someone going to fix this? The offline wiki is a nice thing\
      \ because it ensures you have access to all docs even if the wiki goes down\

      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> It's down to BU admins. You can contact them yourself&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>feid:</b> so you can do nothing at all, i mean whats the point for this\
      \ page if nothing is updated, it pretty much useless when new information get\

      \ to remener it by, in the future.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Basically, no, I\

      \ 26% (7,937,234 bytes) using solid RAR!  That's almost 5 MB less.  Even if\
      \ you made the archive self extracting, it would be a lot lighter.  Keep up\
      \ the good work, and count me in, even if I spend most of my wiki time on the\
      \ offline version!\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' We're limited by the compression software\
      \ that's available on the server.  We have zip and bzip2 there, but no RAR compression\
      \ utility (or I'm just bad at guessing names).  If you could point me to one\
      \ that runs under Linux, I'll ask the BeyondUnreal admins to install it.\n\n\
      '''El Muerte TDS:''' unrar is free, rar isn't.\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' btw here\
      \ are some stats:\n 34226176 in total\n 12728922 test.zip\n 8134137  test.tar.bz2\n\
      \ 8966783  test.tar.gz\n \n\nbzip2 generates a high system load, gzip doesn't.\
      \ So I think using tar gzip is the best solution.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Sounds\
      \ like a good idea.  Is .tgz widely enough supported by Windows archivers to\
      \ allow us to completely scratch the .zip version in favor of a .tgz one?\n\n\
      '''Mysterial:''' WinZip and WinRAR support it and they're the two most widely\
      \ used archivers.\n\n'''Chema:''' Usually bandwith is more precious ('myyyy\
      \ preshiouuus' ;-) ) than some extra cpu cycles, but bzip2 is indeeded not widely\
      \ supported in Windows: just by WinRAR and, well, bzip2.exe, to my knowledge\
      \ (WinZip barely provides tgz support &ndash; just decompression, couse zip\
      \ provides \"similar functionality\". haha).\n\nWell, you could provide both\
      \ formats, but that means even more cycles.  But even better would be to have\
      \ weekly snapshots, that would weight a few hundred KBs in tgz.  A simple \"\
      find . -ctime 7\" would do the trick; well, if your usual script is that simple\
      \ too.\n\nBut I see there is still the zip pack.  If I can help writing the\
      \ stuff, just tell me so (with a brief, err, debriefing: sh or perl? target\
      \ for cron?).\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' I don't know if weekly snapshots are such\
      \ a good idea, because it would require you to download  the snapshot everyweek,\
      \ you can't mis a single week or you will have to download the full snapshot\
      \ again. And the offline wiki is only intresting for users without broadband.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Adding support for RAR is a matter of (1) having a RAR compressor\
      \ for Linux and (2) adding a single line of code to the current Offline Wiki\
      \ (Perl) script.  My concern is more for BeyondUnreal's bandwidth than the users'\
      \ in this case; right now a single 13 MB-file is uploaded to all mirrors once\
      \ a day, and each compression format we'd provide in addition to that would\
      \ add to that load (multiplied by the number of mirrors, naturally).\n\n'''Chema:'''\
      \ Err, you got me wrong: I was talking about bzip2 format, not RAR.  Anyway,\
      \ yes, I think that having 2 formats its not elegant (not 'perlish' ;-) ), thats\
      \ why I think the weekly snapshot is much better.\n\nIn response to El Muerte,\
      \ you don't have to get the snapshot every week: I think they should be really\
      \ tiny (100-500KB at most, in tgz? well, not counting when I upload my vactaion\
      \ pics!), and several of them could be stored on the Offline Wiki page.  So\
      \ you just need to check your last update, and get the newer snapshots.\n\n\
      '''El Muerte TDS:''' what about this: \"snapshot on request\" you can select\
      \ the timeframe of the snapshot and then a archive will be created on the fly\
      \ and feeded realtime to your browser ;)\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Hmm... maybe that's\
      \ not even so far off.  Executing the Offline Wiki script takes several minutes\
      \ to complete, but that's mostly due to several thousand pages that have to\
      \ be read and formatted.  Actually packing a subset of pages into a downloadable\
      \ archive file takes much less time. &ndash; However, the problem remains that\
      \ file downloads shouldn't be served directly from a BeyondUnreal-hosted site.\n\
      \n'''GRAF1K:''' Gehn, the offline wiki file size does change frequently due\
      \ to constant edits. Thanks for the update.\n\n----\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Offline\
      \ Wiki is up and running again after it went down April 29, 2004, and nobody\
      \ bothered telling me/us... according to hal from BeyondUnreal, the Perl script\
      \ building the Offline Wiki has been throwing warning messages for quite a while,\
      \ but they chose to ignore them rather than to tell us about them.  :-/\n\n\
      '''Tarquin:''' I had no idea... \n\n----\n\n'''El Muerte:''' I've put up an\
      \ readonly mirror of the UnrealWiki [http://unreal.student.utwente.nl/wiki/\
      \ here], it uses this offline wiki for it's content. Quite some things don't\
      \ work (like search), and the page naming isn't 1on1, but at least we'll have\
      \ a fallback when BU goes offline again.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' it's broken, the\
      \ current archive is from november 5\n\n----\n\n'''Techno_JF:''' Just so it's\
      \ clear, the offline wiki hasn't been updated in a while.  I don't know if that's\
      \ by accident or by design, but I think people should be aware of it either\
      \ way.  I just downloaded it, and the date on the pages said \"Sat, November\
      \ 5, 2005\".  For reference, today's date is February 21, 2006.\n\n'''HC Denton:'''\
      \ Is someone going to fix this? The offline wiki is a nice thing because it\
      \ ensures you have access to all docs even if the wiki goes down temporarily..\n\
      \n'''FEID:''' i noticed the same problem the offline wiki isn't working and\
      \ \n\ncan't get recent Added Pages!!!  \n\n----\n\n'''fyfe:''' Almost a year\
      \ now and the offline wiki is still offline. Is it dead for good, or is it just\
      \ a glitch the higher ups haven't noticed :p\n\n'''Tarquin:''' It's down to\
      \ BU admins. You can contact them yourself :)\n\n'''feid:''' so you can do nothing\
      \ at all, i mean whats the point for this page if nothing is updated, it pretty\
      \ much useless when new information get published, and what about when our precious\
      \ wiki is gone, i want somthing to remener it by, in the future.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Basically, no, I can't do anything. BU's server must be doing something wrong.\n\
      \n'''fyfe:''' Sent an e-mail to qapete, but I never got a response.\n\n'''fyfe:'''\
      \ Got a e-mail from qapete, it's now fixed :)\n\n'''fyfe:''' But it doesn't\
      \ look like it's hit the mirrors yet :(\n\n'''fyfe:''' The mirrors have caught\
      \ up now :D\n\n----\n\n'''Meindratheal:''' When will this next get updated?\
      \ I (and a lot of others, I guess) could do with a more up-to-date version so\
      \ I can read up on everything at home :)\n\n----\n\n===Blocking offline readers===\n\
      \n'''fyfe:''' Not sure if you've got anything like this implemented, but if\
      \ you wanted to block the casual user from strip mining the wiki with an offline\

      \ on\n\n# Send offline readers to offlinewiki.html\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}\
