      \ taken over, etc), but I'll probably get those worked out tomorrow. Screen\

      <p>The layout is coming together pretty good on paper. The basement is the most\
      \ dramatically changed from the original. One of the harder parts has been fitting\
      \ the basement inside the castle while keeping the flag paths pretty much equal.\
      \ So far two of the outside-to-inside connections have been eliminated: bowser\
      \ &gt; roof and waterfall &lt;&gt; basement. They've been replaced with door\
      \ to 2nd floor &lt;&gt; roof and a tunnel connecting one team's basement to\
      \ the waterfall on the far side of the other castle. The door connecting the\
      \ basement to the moat area has also been swung around to the other side of\
      \ the castle to make that path a little more dangerous. In general I'm trying\
      \ to encourage travel through the front door or at least the lobby (and then\
