      \ of Modeler, [Like MAX], can be a little confusing. There are several different\
      \ areas. Some of them stay the same and some change when a different tool section\
      \ is accessed (see below).</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Menus_and_Editors\"\

      <dd>Contains commands for saving, loading, and importing exporting files. Commands\
      \ useful to you, besides the save and load, are the import/export commands.\
      \ Lightwave is capable of importing and exporting 3ds files. 3ds is the format\
      \ used most when transferring between modelling programs and Unreal. More information\

      \ to change your surfaces, which are the textures that you apply to your model.\
      \ It has advanced tools to change the different aspects of your textures, such\
      \ as color, transparency, reflection, and bump mapping to name a few. The surface\
      \ editor will be fully explained [To the best of my knowledge] here: <a href=\"\

      \ the images you have imported into your sessions. These images are usually\
      \ images that you have attached to your model's surfaces. Using the image editor\
      \ you can control several different aspects of the image such as frame rate\
      \ for animated images, and brightness/contrast for all images. All tools will\
      \ be described here: <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Lightwave/Image_Editor?redlink=1\"\

      <dd>The presets button allows you to view all the preset textures available\
      \ in the texture directory. Simply choose what texture group you want, and it\
      \ will show you all the textures in that group. Using the surface editor, you\
      \ can then double click on a texture in the presets, and apply it to a surface\
      \ in the surface editor.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ to actually make your designs. It contains buttons for basic shapes, such\
      \ as the box and ball. Using these 'primitives' together, you can create a bigger,\
      \ and more complete model.</dt>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Modify&#160;</dt>\n<dd><a\

      Legacy:Lightwave/Modify Tools (page does not exist)\">Lightwave/Modify Tools</a></dd>\n\
      <dt>| This section has tools that allow you to 'modify' your model. Some examples\
      \ are move, rotate, and size (or scale). Using these tools allows you to change\
      \ the way your model looks without adding more primitives.</dt>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\

      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Lightwave/Multiply Tools (page does not exist)\"\
      >Lightwave/Multiply Tools</a></dd>\n<dt>| Multiply contains tools to multiply\
      \ vertexes and faces. There are several different ways to do this from mirroring,\
      \ which creates an exact copy, to bevel and extruding. Each tool multiplies\
      \ vertexes and faces in a different way.</dt>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Construct&#160;</dt>\n\

      \ title=\"Legacy:Lightwave/Construct Tools (page does not exist)\">Lightwave/Construct\
      \ Tools</a></dd>\n<dt>| The tools in section section allow you to perform specialized\
      \ actions to add or remove polygons. Such examples are triple, which makes every\
      \ selected polygon into a 3 vertex polygon. This is useful for game editting\
      \ because models need to be constructed from 3 vertex polygons. Another tool\
      \ is subdivide which doesn't change the look of the model, but adds polygons\
      \ to a polygon to allow better form.</dt>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Detail&#160;</dt>\n\

      \ Tools</a></dd>\n<dt>| The Detail section allows you to control apsects of\
      \ detail. This is where you control polygon surface information to attach skinning\
      \ groups, and other tools for changing vertexes and skelegons.</dt>\n</dl>\n\

      \ the display of Modeler. There are tools to allow you to change how you look\
      \ at your model, tools that allow you to change the viewports in many ways,\
      \ including their arrangement. [You can have just 2 viewports, for example].\
      \ The object visibility tools are here as well, they allow you to hide and unhide\
      \ areas of your model.</dt>\n</dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Model_Paging_Buttons\"\

      \ This button allows you to switch between different files that have been loaded.\
      \ When a different file is loaded, all the models for that file are put into\
      \ the pages.</p>\n<p>[[Image:Legacy_Lightwave-ModelPages.jpeg|]] The blue arrow\
      \ buttons allow you to flip through the pages. Each page can hold 10 objects.\
      \ The tile that is fully yellow, is the selected model. If only the bottom is\
      \ selected, that means you will see that model in the background. You will not\

    text: "==Lightwave Modeler Interface==\n\nAt first glance, the organization of\
      \ Modeler, [Like MAX], can be a little confusing.  There are several different\
      \ areas.  Some of them stay the same and some change when a different tool section\
      \ is accessed (see below).\n\n===The Menus and Editors===\n\nThese are the buttons\
      \ located in the very top left corner of the modeller.  They allow you to access\
      \ file information, modeler preferences, and the various advanced editors that\
      \ comes with Lightwave.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Lightwave-FileButtons.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \n; File : Contains commands for saving, loading, and importing exporting files.\
      \  Commands useful to you, besides the save and load, are the import/export\
      \ commands.  Lightwave is capable of importing and exporting 3ds files.  3ds\
      \ is the format used most when transferring between modelling programs and Unreal.\
      \  More information about the different options in the file menu will be available\
      \ in a page called [[Legacy:Lightwave/Menus|Lightwave/Menus]]\n;| [[Legacy:Lightwave/Importing\
      \ 3DS|Lightwave/Importing 3DS]]\n;| [[Legacy:Lightwave/Exporting 3DS|Lightwave/Exporting\
      \ 3DS]]\n\n; Modeler : Contains commands that allow you to change the modeler.\
      \  These include options to change the color, the config files, and other such\
      \ options.  It also allows you to add and edit plugins.  A more descriptive\
      \ page will be made for this menu item.  [[Legacy:Lightwave/Menus|Lightwave/Menus]]\n\
      \n; Surface Editor : The surface editor allows you to change your surfaces,\
      \ which are the textures that you apply to your model.  It has advanced tools\
      \ to change the different aspects of your textures, such as color, transparency,\
      \ reflection, and bump mapping to name a few.  The surface editor will be fully\
      \ explained [To the best of my knowledge] here: [[Legacy:Lightwave/Surface Editor|Lightwave/Surface\
      \ Editor]] but not yet. :)\n\n; Image Editor : The image editor controls all\
      \ the images you have imported into your sessions.  These images are usually\
      \ images that you have attached to your model's surfaces.  Using the image editor\
      \ you can control several different aspects of the image such as frame rate\
      \ for animated images, and brightness/contrast for all images.  All tools will\
      \ be described here: [[Legacy:Lightwave/Image Editor|Lightwave/Image Editor]]\
      \ but not yet. :)\n\n; Presets : The presets button allows you to view all the\
      \ preset textures available in the texture directory.  Simply choose what texture\
      \ group you want, and it will show you all the textures in that group.  Using\
      \ the surface editor, you can then double click on a texture in the presets,\
      \ and apply it to a surface in the surface editor.\n\n===The Tool Sections===\n\
      \nThe Lightwave Modeler tools are divided into 7 sections.  These sections are\
      \ shown in the picture below.  When you click on a tab, the list of buttons\
      \ for that section appear on the left.  The buttons at the bottom, are not section\
      \ specific.  Because there are so many buttons in each section, each will have\
      \ it's own page describing the function of each button.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Lightwave-Layout.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \n; Create : [[Legacy:Lightwave/Create Tools|Lightwave/Create Tools]]\n;| The\
      \ create section is used to actually make your designs.  It contains buttons\
      \ for basic shapes, such as the box and ball.  Using these 'primitives' together,\
      \ you can create a bigger, and more complete model.\n\n; Modify : [[Legacy:Lightwave/Modify\
      \ Tools|Lightwave/Modify Tools]]\n;| This section has tools that allow you to\
      \ 'modify' your model.  Some examples are move, rotate, and size (or scale).\
      \  Using these tools allows you to change the way your model looks without adding\
      \ more primitives. \n\n; Multiply : [[Legacy:Lightwave/Multiply Tools|Lightwave/Multiply\
      \ Tools]]\n;| Multiply contains tools to multiply vertexes and faces.  There\
      \ are several different ways to do this from mirroring, which creates an exact\
      \ copy, to bevel and extruding.  Each tool multiplies vertexes and faces in\
      \ a different way.\n\n; Construct : [[Legacy:Lightwave/Construct Tools|Lightwave/Construct\
      \ Tools]]\n;| The tools in section section allow you to perform specialized\
      \ actions to add or remove polygons.  Such examples are triple, which makes\
      \ every selected polygon into a 3 vertex polygon.  This is useful for game editting\
      \ because models need to be constructed from 3 vertex polygons.  Another tool\
      \ is subdivide which doesn't change the look of the model, but adds polygons\
      \ to a polygon to allow better form.\n\n; Detail : [[Legacy:Lightwave/Detail\
      \ Tools|Lightwave/Detail Tools]]\n;| The Detail section allows you to control\
      \ apsects of detail.  This is where you control polygon surface information\
      \ to attach skinning groups, and other tools for changing vertexes and skelegons.\n\
      \n; Map : [[Legacy:Lightwave/Map Tools|Lightwave/Map Tools]]\n;| Contains tools\
      \ for working with UV maps, weight maps, vertex color maps, and other such things.\
      \  My knowledge of this section is almost non-existent so the explanation of\
      \ this section won't come till later.\n\n; Display : [[Legacy:Lightwave/Display\
      \ Tools|Lightwave/Display Tools]]\n;| The section has tools that control the\
      \ display of Modeler.  There are tools to allow you to change how you look at\
      \ your model, tools that allow you to change the viewports in many ways, including\
      \ their arrangement. [You can have just 2 viewports, for example].  The object\
      \ visibility tools are here as well, they allow you to hide and unhide areas\
      \ of your model.\n\n===The Model Paging Buttons===\n\nThese buttons deal with\
      \ viewing your different models.  Each one of these buttons allows you to either\
      \ view different parts of your model, or view different files that you have\
      \ loaded.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Lightwave-FileChooser.jpeg|]] This button allows\
      \ you to switch between different files that have been loaded.  When a different\
      \ file is loaded, all the models for that file are put into the pages.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Lightwave-ModelPages.jpeg|]]\
      \ The blue arrow buttons allow you to flip through the pages.  Each page can\
      \ hold 10 objects.  The tile that is fully yellow, is the selected model.  If\
      \ only the bottom is selected, that means you will see that model in the background.\
      \  You will not see points or polygon information.  It appears as a black wireframe.\n\
      \n[[Image:Legacy_Lightwave-PagingExample.jpeg|center|The main model is shown\
      \ with face and wireframe information, the second model is shown only as a black\
      \ wireframe.]]\n\nYou may select more then 1 model by holding shift and clicking.\
      \  The same goes with the bottom selections.  Any tile that has a small triangle\
      \ at the top, has information in it, even if it's just one vertex.\n\n'''Vailias:'''\
      \ Also the number keys (NOT numpad numbers) allow you direct access to the layers.\
      \ Shift+number = Makes layer visible and editable In addition to any current\
      \ layers. Alt+number puts that layer in background (wireframe). Shift+Alt+number\
      \ adds background (uneditable wireframe) layers.\n \n\n===Viewport Controls===\n\
      \nThe next area that we're going to look at is the veiwport control buttons.\
      \  These are the buttons located above each viewport, and they allow for some\
      \ easy customization.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Lightwave-ViewportButtons.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \n; Viewport Angle : The first button is a combo box and display the different\
      \ angles for which you can view your models.  There are 9 options to choose\
      \ from, and the options that display your model in a 2D view, show the planes\
      \ that the graph uses in that view.\n\n; Viewport Render Style : The button\
      \ with just a down arrow is the Render Style list.  This list [Also a combo\
      \ box] contains the different rendering options.  Some options show just the\
      \ wireframe, others show the polygons, and others show the model with the surface\
      \ information applied.  In order to understand each one, you should try them\
      \ out yourself and use whichever one you prefer the best.  Some of them, though,\
      \ are better for certain situations.\n\n; Pan, Rotate, and Zoom : These buttons\
      \ should be self explanatory.  They allow you to change the view of the camera.\
      \  You can move it with the pan button, and zoom in and out with the zoom button.\
      \  The rotate button only works on the perspective Angle.  These button don't\
      \ actually change your model, they just change the view.\n\n===Bottom Toolbar===\n\
      \nThe bottom toolbar contains tools for different selection methods, cut/copy/paste\
      \ tools, and others.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Lightwave-BottomToolbar.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nThe Points button allows you to select just points (vertices).  The Polygons\
      \ button allows you to select faces.  The volume modes allow you to make a 3d\
      \ volume, and then selects points or polygons lying inside or outside that volume.\
      \  (There are two volume modes, one which counts things that lie on the border\
      \ as being \"inside\", and one which counts them as \"outside\".)\n\nThe modes\
      \ drop down determines the point at which certain actions (such as rotating,\
      \ bending, and stretching) happen; for example, \"Action Center: Origin\" will\
      \ always rotate around the coodinate (0,0,0), while \"Action Center: Pivot\"\
      \ will always rotate around the current layer's pivot point.\n\nThen you have\
      \ your copy/paste buttons.  These buttons work on the currently selected points\
      \ or polygons.  They function the same as any other program uses them.  The\
      \ \"more\" drop down contains any buttons that don't have room to display.\n\
      \nThe buttons on the far right determine what type of vertex map you are working\
      \ with at the moment (and thus, control the type of maps that are being listed\
      \ in the drop-down box to their right).  In order, the buttons are: '''W'''eight,\
      \ UV '''T'''exture, '''M'''orph, and in the most recent versions of the program,\
      \ Vertex '''C'''olor and Point '''S'''elections as well.\n\n==Related Topics==\n\
      * [[Legacy:Lightwave|Lightwave Main]]\n\n==Comments==\n\n'''Mosquito:''' Please\
      \ don't create any of the pages for the empty links on this page.  I'm not sure\
      \ if I actually want those pages yet.\n\n'''Vailias:''' Oops. Didn't read this\
      \ far before adding the 3ds import/export pages. The Export one could be rather\
      \ helpfully though. There are a few Potholes in that operation that need to\
      \ be pointed out.\n\n'''Gregor:''' I'd suggest renaming this page to \"Lightwave/Lightwave\
      \ Interface\" or \"UI\" or some such.  \"Lightwave Layout\" means something\
      \ very specific to Lightwave users.  This page isn't very clear on which version\
      \ of the program it refers to ... the interface gets tweaked a bit with each\
      \ new version.  Finally, the spelling is \"Modeler\", not \"Modeller\", so I\
      \ have fixed that in a few places.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Modeling|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
