      <p>UV mapping is the process of applying a texture to an object. When creating\
      \ static meshes for Unreal Tournament levels, UV maps are usually created (using\
      \ the Map-&gt;New UV Map option) for one of two purposes:</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
      mw-headline\" id=\"Applying_materials_or_skins_to_an_object\">Applying materials\
      \ or skins to an object</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Applying materials or skins to an object\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A surface with the\
      \ name of an existing Unreal Tournament material (such as the concrete texture\
      \ 'bas02ha' from the Humanoid Architecture texture set, for example) is applied\
      \ to various polygons in the object, and the texture scaling is adjusted by\
      \ selecting particular parameters in the 'Make UV' property box, or by manually\
      \ stretching the polygons in a UV view, for example, until the texture has the\
      \ correct proportion and scaling. In this case polygons may overlap in the UV\
      \ space/view, or may extend outside the unit UV coordinate space.</p>\n<p>Alternatively,\
      \ the UV map may be created such that there are no overlapping polygons in the\
      \ UV space (for example using the atlas projection of the 'Make UV' tool in\
      \ Lightwave 8+), so that a 'skin' texture can be created and overlaid over the\
      \ object. If the object is a human head, for example, the skin could be a hand-drawing\
      \ of the eyes, mouth, nose, hair, which would be overlaid over the relevant\
      \ parts of the object by careful manipulation of the UV mapping.</p>\n<p>Both\
      \ types of mapping may be used within the same UV map, with the skinning approach\
      \ used for one surface type, and the material stretching/alignment used for\
      \ other surface types, for example.</p>\n<p>Global surface mapping properties\
      \ can be set in the surface properties of a surface, but the Unreal Tournament\
      \ editor ignores these in favour of explicitly defined UV maps (it uses the\
      \ first-defined UV map?).</p>\n<p>The tutorial below explains how to create\
      \ a simple skin for an object in the Lightwave modeller program.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Creating a light map for an object\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A mapping of polygons to the\
      \ UV space is chosen (usually via the atlas 'Make UV' option in Lightwave 8+)\
      \ such that there are no overlapping polygons in the UV space, and all of the\
      \ polygons are spaced uniformly within the unit (0,0,1,1) UV space. The UV mapping\
      \ is independent of, and usually additional to, any UV maps which map on existing\
      \ materials or skins. The light map UV map exists to allow light maps to be\
      \ created by <a href=\"/Legacy:Rendering_Lightmaps_In_Lightwave\" title=\"Legacy:Rendering\
      \ Lightmaps In Lightwave\">Rendering lightmaps in Lightwave</a> and then applying\
      \ the rendered lightmaps to static meshes within the Unreal Tournament editor.\
      \ Light maps are normally overlaid on static meshes using the <a href=\"/Legacy:UV2Texture\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UV2Texture\">UV2Texture</a> display property; light map UV\
      \ maps must normally be given the name 'UV2' (hence the name 'UV2Texture' and\
      \ for reasons relating to compatibility with 3D Max).</p>\n<p>Often, an object\
      \ is defined in Lightwave with both a material/skin texture mapping UV map (called,\
      \ say, 'UV1') and a lightmap UV (called 'UV2', as discussed further in <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:UV2Texture\" title=\"Legacy:UV2Texture\">UV2Texture</a>), so that fine\
      \ texture detail can be provided without requiring a correspondingly high resolution\
      \ for the lightmap.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"UV_skinning_tutorial\"\

      \ is a breeze thanks to the additions to Lightwave 7.0. The mapping tool tab\
      \ contains most of the tools you'll need for all your UV mapping needs. In this\
      \ tutorial, I'm using Photoshop however because Lightwave supports many different\
      \ image formats, you can really use any image editor, even Windows Paint.</p>\n\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>For this tutorial, I will be using a simple premade\
      \ object. You can download this object here if you wish. In this tutorial, we\
      \ will be using the <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Lightwave/Image_Editor?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Lightwave/Image Editor (page does not exist)\"\

      \ The buttons to access them are at the top left, however, by pressing CTRL+F3\
      \ you can get the surface editor and CTRL+F4 gives you the image editor.</p>\n\
      <p>The first thing we want to do is create the templates for our model. The\
      \ templates give us an area where we can tell where the face begins and ends.\
      \ It is a 2 dimensional image of the wireframe underneath the face.</p>\n<h3><span\

      <p><i>Coming Soon...</i></p>\n<p>After you've read this section, you should\
      \ see something similar to this:</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"\
      floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-Mine.jpeg\" class=\"image\"\
      ><img alt=\"Legacy LW-UVMapping-Mine.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_LW-UVMapping-Mine.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"332\" height=\"330\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>Although you can literally\
      \ jam every polygon onto the UV Map it's sloppy and I don't recommend it. I'm\
      \ going to create a UV map for every side. Since we're looking at this model\
      \ from the top, I've color coded the different sides accordingly.</p>\n<table>\n\
      <tr>\n<td>Top and Bottom Side Panels</td>\n<td>Z Axis</td>\n<td>Blue</td>\n\
      </tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Left and Right Side Panels</td>\n<td>X Axis</td>\n<td>Green</td>\n\
      </tr>\n</table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Disconnecting_the_Groups\"\
      >Disconnecting the Groups</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Lightwave/UV_Mapping?section=8\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Disconnecting the Groups\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Now the next thing we need to do, is separate these\
      \ sections from the model. We need to do this so that we can line all of the\
      \ faces up right. I'll explain why later.</p>\n<p>The best way to do this is\
      \ to open up the polygon statistics window using the 'W' key. Scroll down to\
      \ <i>Surface</i>. It should be the 3rd item from the bottom. Select Side_Side_Panels,\
      \ and press the + sign. This should select all the polygons in that group. Now\
      \ just quickly press 'X' then press 'V'. This cut's the selected polygons from\
      \ the model and pastes them back in but it also disconnects them from the rest\
      \ of the model, which is what we want. Do this for the Top/Bottom_Side_Panels\
      \ group as well.</p>\n<p>Now we're ready to make our template.</p>\n<h2><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Making_the_Template\">Making the Template</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Lightwave/UV_Mapping?section=9\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Making the Template\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>Now that we have the model divided into sections, and those sections disconnected\
      \ from the rest of the model, we can now safely create our templates. In the\
      \ top left viewport, click on the 'View Angle' button and scroll down to 'UV\
      \ Texture'.</p>\n<p>So what you want to do is select one of your groups, again\
      \ you can use the polygon statistic window for this. Select the Side_Side_Panels\
      \ group. Now click on the Map tool tab at the top, and then click on <i>New\
      \ UV Map</i>. A dialog appears similar to the one below.</p>\n<div class=\"\
      center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy LW-UVMapping-NewMap.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"430\" height=\"282\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>Because the right and\
      \ left sides of our model are on the X axis, let's name this map XAxis_Map.\
      \ And make sure that the X Axis button is press. If you choose either of the\
      \ other buttons, it will render the mesh differently. Although you can still\
      \ move and resize the mesh, setting it to X now, will eliminate most of the\
      \ hassle. Now click ok.</p>\n<p>You should now see the selected polygons in\
      \ the top left viewport. Since Lightwave tries to cover the entire area with\
      \ the polygons, you'll see that they are quite out of shape:</p>\n<div class=\"\
      center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap2.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy LW-UVMapping-NewMap2.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap2.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"132\" height=\"134\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>This is really easy\
      \ to fix using simple mesh modify tools. First, go to the Modify tool tab and\
      \ select the 'Stretch' tool (h). Then click and drag in the top left viewport\
      \ until the mesh looks similar to your model. We do this so that it's easy to\
      \ see how big the polygon faces are when we're coloring over the template.</p>\n\
      <div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap3.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy LW-UVMapping-NewMap3.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap3.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"132\" height=\"134\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>It looks a litte better,\
      \ but there's still something wrong. The top portion is begin overlapped by\
      \ the bottom portion. We can't leave it like this because the texture on the\
      \ top portion will be messed up so we have to move it. At the bottom, press\
      \ the 'Polygons' selection tool. Deselect all the lower portion polygons and\
      \ leave the top ones selected. Then using the move tool (t), move the selection\
      \ up so that it doesn't touch the lower section at all:</p>\n<div class=\"center\"\
      >\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap4.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy LW-UVMapping-NewMap4.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap4.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"132\" height=\"134\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>There. This should create\
      \ a perfect template we can use to draw a texture. Next we'll copy this, and\
      \ paste it into our image editor (Photoshop).</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Now, to copy this into Photoshop, we're going to use\
      \ the Print Screen button. It should be located near the top right corner of\
      \ your keyboard. Press it once and it should copy everything you see onto the\
      \ clipboard.</p>\n<p>Now open Photoshop (or whatever image editor your using).\
      \ In Photoshop, you must create a new document, so do that now. Photoshop automatically\
      \ detects the size of the image on the clipboard and sets the dimensions for\
      \ you. Press CTRL+V to paste the image.</p>\n<p>Now there are several ways to\
      \ go about getting what we want, and what we want is the smal grid in the top\
      \ left layout view. It has our templates right there. You can either select\
      \ it with the select tool (M) or move it to the top left corner and adjust the\
      \ dimensions of the image. The easiest way is to select it, then copy it using\
      \ CTRL+C.</p>\n<p>Now, create a new image, again Photoshop puts the dimensions\
      \ in for the clipboard item. Paste it in using CTRL+V. Ok you now should have\
      \ a template that looks exactly like the grid in Lightwave. Using thise template\
      \ you can create a texture. Anything inside the mesh line is what is going to\
      \ appear on that part of the mesh.</p>\n<p>Since this is just a tutorial, let's\
      \ do some quick drawing:</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"\

      \ you go over the lines, only what is inside the lines is going to appear on\
      \ the model. And since I want to get this done and I'm lazy, I'm only going\
      \ to paint the top portion of the mine. Ok so now you need to save this image\
      \ as any of the formats listed below:</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ Let's go back into Lightwave now. Click on the surface editor button or press\
      \ CTRL+F3. On the left side, you should see the list of your groups. Select\
      \ the Side_Side_Panels. Now making sure that you're in the basic tab, click\
      \ on the <i>Texture</i> button beside the color. The Texture button is the button\
      \ with a little T.</p>\n<p>This is the texture window. For projection choose\
      \ UV, for UV Map choose XAxis_Sides, and for Image choose 'Load Image', and\
      \ choose the image you just saved. Now go to the top left viewport, and change\
      \ the angle to 'Perspective', and change the render type to 'Texture'. You should\
      \ now see your texture applied to the right and left sides of the model!</p>\n\

      \ our top/bottom sides. Since we've already got everything setup, this should\
      \ be a breeze. Using the Polygon Statistics (W), select the Top/Bottom_Side_Panels\
      \ group. Make sure nothing else is selected and click the 'New UV Map' button.</p>\n\
      <p>Call this one 'ZAxis_Map' and set it's axis to Z. Press ok and you should\
      \ see your selected faces in the top left viewport. Now to make things really\

      \ and choose the image you just saved.</p>\n<p>Scale your model using the modify\
      \ tools until it fits the template. If you want find control, use the 'Drag'\
      \ tool (CTRL+T). This allows you to move the points into perfect positions.\
      \ Now you'll notice that even though the model is lined up, it still doesn't\
      \ show on the model.</p>\n<p>Go back into the surface editor, and choose your\
      \ Top/Bottom_Side_Panels group. Click the texture button next to color. Same\
      \ thing as last time; Set Projection to UV, set UV Map to ZAxis_Map, and set\

    text: "==Overview==\n\nUV mapping is the process of applying a texture to an object.\
      \ When creating static meshes for Unreal Tournament levels, UV maps are usually\
      \ created (using the Map->New UV Map option) for one of two purposes:\n\n===Applying\
      \ materials or skins to an object===\n\nA surface with the name of an existing\
      \ Unreal Tournament material (such as the concrete texture 'bas02ha' from the\
      \ Humanoid Architecture texture set, for example) is applied to various polygons\
      \ in the object, and the texture scaling is adjusted by selecting particular\
      \ parameters in the 'Make UV' property box, or by manually stretching the polygons\
      \ in a UV view, for example, until the texture has the correct proportion and\
      \ scaling. In this case polygons may overlap in the UV space/view, or may extend\
      \ outside the unit UV coordinate space.\n\nAlternatively, the UV map may be\
      \ created such that there are no overlapping polygons in the UV space (for example\
      \ using the atlas projection of the 'Make UV' tool in Lightwave 8+), so that\
      \ a 'skin' texture can be created and overlaid over the object. If the object\
      \ is a human head, for example, the skin could be a hand-drawing of the eyes,\
      \ mouth, nose, hair, which would be overlaid over the relevant parts of the\
      \ object by careful manipulation of the UV mapping.\n\nBoth types of mapping\
      \ may be used within the same UV map, with the skinning approach used for one\
      \ surface type, and the material stretching/alignment used for other surface\
      \ types, for example.\n\nGlobal surface mapping properties can be set in the\
      \ surface properties of a surface, but the Unreal Tournament editor ignores\
      \ these in favour of explicitly defined UV maps (it uses the first-defined UV\
      \ map?).\n\nThe tutorial below explains how to create a simple skin for an object\
      \ in the Lightwave modeller program.\n\n===Creating a light map for an object===\n\
      \nA mapping of polygons to the UV space is chosen (usually via the atlas 'Make\
      \ UV' option in Lightwave 8+) such that there are no overlapping polygons in\
      \ the UV space, and all of the polygons are spaced uniformly within the unit\
      \ (0,0,1,1) UV space. The UV mapping is independent of, and usually additional\
      \ to, any UV maps which map on existing materials or skins. The light map UV\
      \ map exists to allow light maps to be created by [[Legacy:Rendering Lightmaps\
      \ In Lightwave|Rendering lightmaps in Lightwave]] and then applying the rendered\
      \ lightmaps to static meshes within the Unreal Tournament editor. Light maps\
      \ are normally overlaid on static meshes using the [[Legacy:UV2Texture|UV2Texture]]\
      \ display property; light map UV maps must normally be given the name 'UV2'\
      \ (hence the name 'UV2Texture' and for reasons relating to compatibility with\
      \ 3D Max).\n\nOften, an object is defined in Lightwave with both a material/skin\
      \ texture mapping UV map (called, say, 'UV1') and a lightmap UV (called 'UV2',\
      \ as discussed further in [[Legacy:UV2Texture|UV2Texture]]), so that fine texture\
      \ detail can be provided without requiring a correspondingly high resolution\
      \ for the lightmap.\n\n==UV skinning tutorial==\n\n''Work in Progress''\n\n\
      UV Mapping in Lightwave is a breeze thanks to the additions to Lightwave 7.0.\
      \  The mapping tool tab contains most of the tools you'll need for all your\
      \ UV mapping needs.  In this tutorial, I'm using Photoshop however because Lightwave\
      \ supports many different image formats, you can really use any image editor,\
      \ even Windows Paint.\n\n===Prerequisites===\n\n* Lightwave 7.0 (or greater)\n\
      * A Lightwave model (download mine)\n* Image Editor (Photoshop Recommended)\n\
      \n==Model Preparation==\n\nFor this tutorial, I will be using a simple premade\
      \ object.  You can download this object here if you wish.  In this tutorial,\
      \ we will be using the [[Legacy:Lightwave/Image Editor|Image Editor]] and the\
      \ [[Legacy:Lightwave/Surface Editor|Surface Editor]] a lot so you may want to\
      \ familiarize yourself with them.  The buttons to access them are at the top\
      \ left, however, by pressing CTRL+F3 you can get the surface editor and CTRL+F4\
      \ gives you the image editor.\n\nThe first thing we want to do is create the\
      \ templates for our model.  The templates give us an area where we can tell\
      \ where the face begins and ends.  It is a 2 dimensional image of the wireframe\
      \ underneath the face.\n\n===Grouping the Polygons===\n\n''Coming Soon...''\n\
      \nAfter you've read this section, you should see something similar to this:\n\
      \n[[Image:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-Mine.jpeg|center|]]\n\nAlthough you can literally\
      \ jam every polygon onto the UV Map it's sloppy and I don't recommend it.  I'm\
      \ going to create a UV map for every side.  Since we're looking at this model\
      \ from the top, I've color coded the different sides accordingly.\n\n{|\n\n\
      |-\n|Top and Bottom Side Panels\n|Z Axis\n|Blue\n|-\n|Left and Right Side Panels\n\
      |X Axis\n|Green\n|}\n\n===Disconnecting the Groups===\n\nNow the next thing\
      \ we need to do, is separate these sections from the model.  We need to do this\
      \ so that we can line all of the faces up right.  I'll explain why later.\n\n\
      The best way to do this is to open up the polygon statistics window using the\
      \ 'W' key.  Scroll down to ''Surface''.  It should be the 3rd item from the\
      \ bottom. Select Side_Side_Panels, and press the + sign.  This should select\
      \ all the polygons in that group.  Now just quickly press 'X' then press 'V'.\
      \  This cut's the selected polygons from the model and pastes them back in but\
      \ it also disconnects them from the rest of the model, which is what we want.\
      \  Do this for the Top/Bottom_Side_Panels group as well.\n\nNow we're ready\
      \ to make our template.\n\n==Making the Template==\n\nNow that we have the model\
      \ divided into sections, and those sections disconnected from the rest of the\
      \ model, we can now safely create our templates.  In the top left viewport,\
      \ click on the 'View Angle' button and scroll down to 'UV Texture'.\n\nSo what\
      \ you want to do is select one of your groups, again you can use the polygon\
      \ statistic window for this.  Select the Side_Side_Panels group.  Now click\
      \ on the Map tool tab at the top, and then click on ''New UV Map''.  A dialog\
      \ appears similar to the one below.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nBecause the right and left sides of our model are on the X axis, let's name\
      \ this map XAxis_Map.  And make sure that the X Axis button is press.  If you\
      \ choose either of the other buttons, it will render the mesh differently. \
      \ Although you can still move and resize the mesh, setting it to X now, will\
      \ eliminate most of the hassle.  Now click ok.\n\nYou should now see the selected\
      \ polygons in the top left viewport.  Since Lightwave tries to cover the entire\
      \ area with the polygons, you'll see that they are quite out of shape:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap2.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nThis is really easy to fix using simple mesh modify tools.  First, go to the\
      \ Modify tool tab and select the 'Stretch' tool (h).  Then click and drag in\
      \ the top left viewport until the mesh looks similar to your model.  We do this\
      \ so that it's easy to see how big the polygon faces are when we're coloring\
      \ over the template.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap3.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nIt looks a litte better, but there's still something wrong.  The top portion\
      \ is begin overlapped by the bottom portion.  We can't leave it like this because\
      \ the texture on the top portion will be messed up so we have to move it.  At\
      \ the bottom, press the 'Polygons' selection tool.  Deselect all the lower portion\
      \ polygons and leave the top ones selected.  Then using the move tool (t), move\
      \ the selection up so that it doesn't touch the lower section at all:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-NewMap4.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nThere.  This should create a perfect template we can use to draw a texture.\
      \  Next we'll copy this, and paste it into our image editor (Photoshop).\n\n\
      ==Creating the Texture==\n\nNow, to copy this into Photoshop, we're going to\
      \ use the Print Screen button.  It should be located near the top right corner\
      \ of your keyboard.  Press it once and it should copy everything you see onto\
      \ the clipboard.\n\nNow open Photoshop (or whatever image editor your using).\
      \  In Photoshop, you must create a new document, so do that now.  Photoshop\
      \ automatically detects the size of the image on the clipboard and sets the\
      \ dimensions for you.  Press CTRL+V to paste the image.\n\nNow there are several\
      \ ways to go about getting what we want, and what we want is the smal grid in\
      \ the top left layout view.  It has our templates right there.  You can either\
      \ select it with the select tool (M) or move it to the top left corner and adjust\
      \ the dimensions of the image.  The easiest way is to select it, then copy it\
      \ using CTRL+C.\n\nNow, create a new image, again Photoshop puts the dimensions\
      \ in for the clipboard item.  Paste it in using CTRL+V.  Ok you now should have\
      \ a template that looks exactly like the grid in Lightwave.  Using thise template\
      \ you can create a texture.  Anything inside the mesh line is what is going\
      \ to appear on that part of the mesh.\n\nSince this is just a tutorial, let's\
      \ do some quick drawing:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-Texture1.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nIt doesn't matter if you go over the lines, only what is inside the lines\
      \ is going to appear on the model.  And since I want to get this done and I'm\
      \ lazy, I'm only going to paint the top portion of the mine.  Ok so now you\
      \ need to save this image as any of the formats listed below:\n\n====Supported\
      \ Image Formats====\n\n{|\n\n|-\n|BMP\n|Bitmap\n|-\n|JPG/JPEG\n|JPEG\n|-\n|PSD\n\
      |Photoshop PSD\n|-\n|TGA\n|Targa\n|}\n\n''More coming...''\n\nI like Bitmap\
      \ because it is very portable between programs.  So save it as something like\
      \ XAxis_Panel.bmp.\n\n==Applying the Texture==\n\nNow we're ready to put the\
      \ texture onto our mesh.  Let's go back into Lightwave now.  Click on the surface\
      \ editor button or press CTRL+F3.  On the left side, you should see the list\
      \ of your groups.  Select the Side_Side_Panels.  Now making sure that you're\
      \ in the basic tab, click on the ''Texture'' button beside the color.  The Texture\
      \ button is the button with a little T.\n\nThis is the texture window.  For\
      \ projection choose UV, for UV Map choose XAxis_Sides, and for Image choose\
      \ 'Load Image', and choose the image you just saved.  Now go to the top left\
      \ viewport, and change the angle to 'Perspective', and change the render type\
      \ to 'Texture'.  You should now see your texture applied to the right and left\
      \ sides of the model!\n\n[[Image:Legacy_LW-UVMapping-AppliedTexture.jpeg|center|]]\n\
      \nThis is all good but we still need to texture our top/bottom sides.  Since\
      \ we've already got everything setup, this should be a breeze.  Using the Polygon\
      \ Statistics (W), select the Top/Bottom_Side_Panels group.  Make sure nothing\
      \ else is selected and click the 'New UV Map' button.\n\nCall this one 'ZAxis_Map'\
      \ and set it's axis to Z.  Press ok and you should see your selected faces in\
      \ the top left viewport.  Now to make things really easy, click on the render\
      \ options button (the one wiith just a down arrow) and choose the image you\
      \ just saved.\n\nScale your model using the modify tools until it fits the template.\
      \  If you want find control, use the 'Drag' tool (CTRL+T).  This allows you\
      \ to move the points into perfect positions.  Now you'll notice that even though\
      \ the model is lined up, it still doesn't show on the model.\n\nGo back into\
      \ the surface editor, and choose your Top/Bottom_Side_Panels group.  Click the\
      \ texture button next to color.  Same thing as last time; Set Projection to\
      \ UV, set UV Map to ZAxis_Map, and set image to your image.  Press 'Use Texture',\
      \ close the surface editor and all the sides of your model should now have the\
      \ texture.\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''Amen:''' Wouldn't lightwave's anchor UV Map\
