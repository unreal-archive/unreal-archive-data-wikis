      \ does just that. Captures the Object's UV map(s). One thing of note is that\
      \ the UV data is only available for export if at least one surface referances\
      \ that map. (see the <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Lightwave/Surface_Editor?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Lightwave/Surface Editor (page does not exist)\"\
      >Lightwave/Surface Editor</a> section for more information directly regarding\
      \ that.)</p>\n<p><b>Apply Rotation Check Box:</b> Alters the object's rotation\
      \ upon export. This is necessarry since each 3d modeling application has its\
      \ own coordinant system, and up vector. The default value orients the object\
      \ correctly in 3ds max. <b>Apply Custom Rotation</b> allows you to specify the\
      \ angular offset.</p>\n<p><b>TIP:</b> If going to maya from Lightwave, use 3ds\
      \ format, and turn off the rotation settings, just besure to use a z-up world\
      \ in maya (set in your perferances). The object will be oriented properly.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Scale Object:</b> Scales the object by the typed in factor.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b>\
      \ When traveling from program to program you will find that scale seems to jump\
      \ about alot. The reason is Default units. Lightwave defaults to meters. So\
      \ a human is 2 units tall. If you transfer to Max that human will be 2 Units\
      \ tall (as far as I know max is still unspecified units). In maya it will be\
      \ 2 CM tall. This is a serious issue since your human in the Unreal Universe\
      \ needs to be about 96 units(unreal units) tall (the reason maya to UT modeling\
      \ uses CM as a default unit). So to get a properly scaled model(for UT) into\
      \ another program you need to scale by a factor of about 50 (48 works too).</p>\n\
      <p><b>Final Caveat:</b> Lightwave's UV maps will not (normally) transfer properly\
      \ useing this plugin. The reason is a limitation of the 3ds format not supporting\
      \ discontinuous uv coordinants. The solution is to \"break\" your object before\
      \ You export it. The default hotkey for that is ctrl+u. It separates each polygon\
      \ into its own entity (ie they dont share points). This makes the smoothing\
      \ go away, but the UV coords will transfer. FYI Max does this automatically\
      \ when exporting to 3ds format also, it simply recombines the verticies when\
      \ loading its own formats, so most max users don't notice the differance.</p>\n\
