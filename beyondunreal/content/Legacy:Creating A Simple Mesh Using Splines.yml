      \ Max, so things like applying materials and UVW mapping will not be covered\
      \ here → there are other pages for that.</p>\n<p>If you have never worked with\
      \ splines before, hopefully after reading this article you will think totally\
      \ differently about how you model. Splines have features such as easy level\
      \ of detail adjustment without having to handle meshes on a per-face basis.\
      \ Splines are basically a bunch of lines that can be shaped to create a 'skeleton'\
      \ (Officially known as a Spline Network) of an object. You then apply the surface\
      \ modifier to this skeleton to get an actual object.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Getting Started\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In this tutorial we will be creating a T-Section pipe.\
      \ The principles used to create this object can be generally be applied to almost\
      \ everything you can think of.</p>\n<p>To get started, first we need to set\
      \ our grid to a power of two, 8 or 16 is a good number, I also suggest cutting\
      \ gridsnap on. Next draw a circle with the radius of 64 in the left view. After\
      \ doing so, convert it to an editable spline. Go to the modify tab and select\
      \ element. Select the circle we just created and clone(shift+drag) it over 128\
      \ units Do this 2 more times until you end up with the following:</p>\n<div\
      \ class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_spline_pipe_1.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\" title=\"Starting to make our 'skeleton'\"><img alt=\"Starting\
      \ to make our 'skeleton'\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_spline_pipe_1.jpeg\" width=\"\
      538\" height=\"386\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>This has created the main body\
      \ of our pipe. You're probably wondering how a bunch of circles is going to\
      \ help us make a pipe but you will soon see&#160;:)</p>\n<p>Select a circle\
      \ (in the top view) and clone it. We now need to rotate it 90 degrees (have\
      \ Angle snapping on) so we can create the connecting pipe. After doing so, position\
      \ it between the middle two circles. Now clone it down 128 Units. We now need\
      \ to go into Segment mode and select the top two segments of a circle (In the\
      \ top view) and copy it to the middle of the long pipe(It will be 64 units from\
      \ either existing circle). You should end up with something like this:</p>\n\
      <div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_spline_pipe_2.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\" title=\"See all those X's? We're about to play connect the\
      \ dots between them\"><img alt=\"See all those X's? We're about to play connect\
      \ the dots between them\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_spline_pipe_2.jpeg\" width=\"\
      538\" height=\"386\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>The reason we did this is so that\
      \ the other pipe will have something to connect to. The thing about splines\
      \ is that all spline vertexes must be connect via another spline. Gaps will\
      \ cause the surface not to be created.</p>\n<p>Now that we have all of our curved\
      \ splines made, we can make the splines (lines in this case) that connect them\
      \ all. You MUST cut endpoint snapping on for this to work correctly. Go through\
      \ connecting all of the verts that are parallel to each other (It'll make sense\
      \ once you do it a while) using the new line option under the editable spline\
      \ modifier. <i>NOTE→The order in which you create the spline determines which\
      \ way the normals will point by default. Try to make them all run in the same\
      \ direction</i></p>\n<p>A neat thing about splines is that you can create a\
      \ reference copy of the base spline skeleton and edit the surface it creates\
      \ in real time. To do it, all you have to do is select the editable spline (The\
      \ entire object, with no selection modes active) clone it to a new location,\
      \ and when Max pops the <b>Clone Options</b> Dialog up, select <b>Reference</b>.\
      \ Now apply the Surface Modifier and hopefully a meshed version of your pipe\
      \ will show up. Also, make sure <b>Remove Interior Patches</b> is checked, and\
      \ check <b>Flip Normals</b> if the object is inside-out. Right now is a good\
      \ time to adjust the resolution by changing the 'Patch Topology Steps' (Higher\
      \ is more polys).</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"\
      /File:Legacy_spline_pipe_3.jpeg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Finished spline 'skeleton'\
      \ and referenced surface\"><img alt=\"Finished spline 'skeleton' and referenced\
      \ surface\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_spline_pipe_3.jpeg\" width=\"538\" height=\"\
      386\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>If you didn't end up with this, make sure that\
      \ you didn't miss any verts while adding lines, and that they are all lined\
      \ up (Having endpoint snap on should of prevented this though). This is the\
      \ number one step that where you will run into problems. I have noticed that\
      \ sometimes a mesh just refuses to be created. In that case, just re-make your\
      \ lines (Not the circles). The nice thing about having the referenced copy is\
      \ that you can watch the mesh being re-generated as you create (or move!) the\
      \ lines. A matter of fact, you could of created this reference copy from the\
      \ very beginning and watched the mesh be created as you placed all of the splines.</p>\n\
