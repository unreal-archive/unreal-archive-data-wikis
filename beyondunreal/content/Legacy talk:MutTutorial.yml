    text: "<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I don't understand what this is trying to show, or why\
      \ there is no text on that page, only script. Secondly, in your script comments\
      \ there are a number of questions you've left, and a few misconceptions. I suggest\
      \ you get wait for feedback on it first before adding it to the chain of lessons.</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Imagine you are completely new to Unreal Script. Is this\
      \ page going to actually help you in <a href=\"/Legacy:Setting_Up_UnrealScript\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Setting Up UnrealScript\">Setting Up UnrealScript</a> or how\
      \ to <a href=\"/Legacy:Set_Up_Package_Folders\" title=\"Legacy:Set Up Package\
      \ Folders\">Set Up Package Folders</a>. There's no set of pre-requisites mentioned\
      \ anywhere or even any real explanation of what is going on (note to self -\
      \ must add them to my tut. page). To my mind the worst thing about the tutorial\
      \ is that you've assumed that someone has downloaded your code. Try and fit\
      \ your tutorial into a similar structure to the other tutorials on the Wiki.\
      \ At least that way all of the tutorials will be in a similar form. Also one\
      \ of your stated commands will not work under Windows XP, and one of them is\
      \ redundant - but maybe I'm just being picky in my old age.</p>\n<p><b>Mr.bob</b>\
      \ Uhhhhhhhhhh... what are pre-requisites (I mean in ucode context). Also that\
      \ is kind of weird because I just used this mut in windows xp and it compiled\
      \ and then worked flawlessly. Also what does redundant mean. About the prompt\
      \ command I think you are talking about, I'm surprised it didn't work. Maybe\
      \ I misspelled it but when I type \"prompt $1 into command line in windows XP\
      \ it gives me a blank prompt which is what I want. Finally there is a smiley\
      \ I've been wanting to try out...<br />\n&#160;:stupid:</p>\n<p>Oh ya, most\
      \ importantly this tutorial was not meant for reading, it was meant for downloading\
      \ as folders a .uc file and a .int file. However that didn't seem to work out.\
      \ In response to Tarquin (who seems to really enjoy messing with and moving\
      \ around my things ... this gives me an idea&#160;:cheesy: ) this code is trying\
      \ to give newbs some code that they can mess around with and understand. The\
      \ very first step people do when they are learning to mess with code is to do\
      \ things like replace the word health with shield, and this code lets them do\
      \ that.</p>\n<p>Later: Just discovered that all the links I had previously posted\
      \ to the .zip file were broken. Here is one that has to work: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.home.earthlink.net/~doodlethe1/MutNeedBetterName\"\
      >THE FILE</a></p>\n<p>Tarquin, why don't you tell me what the misconceptions\
      \ are so I can fix them, you people should really give me a lot more input,\
      \ although the problem is you can't because there are no links to this page.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> things like \"says that there is a local variable that applies\
      \ only to Xpawns, and that varaible is x.\" Please also take care to spell correctly.\
      \ And please remove your tutorial from the list – you can put the link further\
      \ down the page if you like. You can get it linked by addding a category tag\
      \ to this page.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> The redundant command is indeed\
      \ the prompt one. You might not like to see where you are in the directory structure\
      \ but I'm betting most people (like me) do. Not only that, but the command is\
      \ irrelevant. You don't need it to compile any Unreal Script at all - but that's\
      \ not explained.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>The one I thought wouldn't work under XP was\
      \ running \"command\". It does work but gives you the old Win9x DOS shell. The\
      \ XP version (like NT) is <i>cmd</i>.</dd>\n<dd>Pre-requisites in Unreal Script\
      \ terms are the basic things someone needs to know before they can starting\
      \ writing code. I linked to them in my previous post. Also, simply downloading\
      \ some code and then tweaking the values to see what they do is a very inefficient\
      \ way of learning. A good tutorial does the following:</dd>\n<dd>* Explains\
      \ what the tutorial will cover and what the person is supposed to learn from\
      \ doing it.</dd>\n<dd>* Explains what the person doing the tutorial needs to\
      \ know in order to complete it. That is - the assumed <i>base knowledge</i>\
      \ or as we like to say <i>prerequisites</i>.</dd>\n<dd>* Explain in simple steps\
      \ what must be done to accomplish the goal of the tutorial. At this point explaining\
      \ why things are done (in this case why ModifyPlayer() was used) in a lot of\
      \ detail is necessary. Your description of ModifyPlayer() is somewhat vague\
      \ – and could even be misleading. And also, you should never ever leave questions\
      \ unanswered in a tutorial.</dd>\n<dd>* Conclude with a summary of what the\
      \ person is supposed to have learned from the tutorial.</dd>\n<dd>So to reiterate\
      \ my original point, simply providing people with some code they can mess about\
      \ with is not a tutorial. It's also unlikely to help them write their own code\
      \ in the future as it provides no method for understanding why something was\
      \ done in a specific way.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b> At this point I am\
      \ once again forced to admit to my newbishness (is that even a word?) and bow\
      \ down to your superior knowledge. Putting the tutorial on the front page was\
      \ reckless and hasty (what do you expect, I'm 14). I will delete it from the\
      \ front page and start working on one worthy of this terrific site, thx for\
      \ the advice <a href=\"/Legacy:EntropicLqd\" title=\"Legacy:EntropicLqd\">EntropicLqd</a>\
      \ and sorry for bugging you by posting so much junk <a href=\"/Legacy:Tarquin\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Tarquin\">Tarquin</a>. A few more points, command, while not\
      \ as good a cmd still works, but thx anyway for the update. Just saying it would\
      \ help if you included a description of what modify player does, considering\
      \ my description was very incorrect.</p>\n<p>Growing up in the age of spell\
      \ checkers has severely damaged my spelling capabilities.</p>\n<p>My brother\
      \ is insisting that I keep the things in progress section intact with my link\
      \ in it, but I'm telling him <a href=\"/Legacy:Tarquin\" title=\"Legacy:Tarquin\"\
      >Tarquin</a> isn't going to be happy.</p>\n<p>Whew, that should do it, the tutorial\
      \ isn't perfect yet, but it is much better then before. It is still not in traditional\
      \ tutorial format, but I don't really like the traditional tutorial format.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I put some more comments in there to explain some stuff that\
      \ was a bit misleading. However, as you can now see, the comments take up so\
      \ much space it's hard to see the code. What you might consider doing is listing\
      \ the code in it's entirety (without the play by play comments) and then below\
      \ that take each line and show it dissected.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> \"I was\
      \ sick of lessons like the regeneration mutator that would tell you to modify\
      \ some code you found without telling you what that code meant.\" – I think\
      \ that is an <i>excellent</i> point! We should look into adding a \"How it works\"\
      \ or \"What's going on\" section to our scripting tutorial pages!</p>\n<p><b>Mr.Bob's\
      \ brother:</b> a simple note about the prompt $1 thing. we use it because in\
      \ Windows XP home edition you start in this part of the directory structure:\
      \ <tt>C:/Documents and settings/~username&gt;</tt> and the UT2004 directory\
      \ is <tt>C:/UT2004</tt> so we need to make the directory structure become blank\
      \ to go down to C:/.</p>\n<p>PS. call me Doodle77 because it is my username\
      \ for a bunch of games</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> The <i>prompt</i> command\
      \ simply changes the DOS prompt. It <i>does not</i> change the directory you\
      \ are in. I suspect you actually meant <code>cd c:\\UT2004</code>. If you wanted\
      \ to make the directory structure blank then <code>format C:\\</code> is the\
      \ command you are after.</p>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b> Never mind, you can type in\
      \ the file path without typing in prompt $1 first, i have changed the script\
      \ apropratly in light of this new discovery.</p>\n<p>Wow this tutorial is really\
      \ something now. Now i think it can add it to the chain. I will update the .zip\
      \ file with the new code, and add it to the top of the Uscript lessons. The\
      \ full exspanation of what the code means will REALLY help out people who are\
      \ compleate newbs to programing.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Please could you:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>make links in your text</li>\n<li>add a few headings perhaps</li>\n\
      <li>fix spelling mistakes</li>\n<li>explain what the variables you have modified\
      \ mean</li>\n<li>I think it would be better to remove the explanations from\
      \ the script entirely, it would make then easier to read – instead of comments\
      \ within script, a section of text with script extracts within it.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Right then Mr.Bob. Please finish off your tutorial in\
      \ the style it has started in. If you do a good job maybe I'll come back and\
      \ extend it with information regarding constructing a configuration GUI for\
      \ it.</p>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b> This is what I like about the wiki, it is not me\
      \ writing this tutorial anymore, it is the whole wiki community. It's very much\
      \ like open source code, that is what makes open source programs so good and\
      \ flawless, there is a large amount of people who can look at the code and change\
      \ things.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Maybe, maybe not. I'm just showing you\
      \ how you should have written it in the first place. I won't be finishing it\
      \ off for you (and I doubt whether anyone else will) as I don't have time. I\
      \ certainly won't be restructuing any more of your tutorials if they are presented\
      \ in the manner similar to the way this one was.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b> While\
      \ I like that more verbal tutes like this are getting written - it should be\
      \ noted that because this is the wiki, tutes like Regen mutator can be appended\
      \ to describe the inner workings of the tutorial itself...</p>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b>\
      \ You said that you wouldn't be finishing it off. Personally I have seen much\
      \ less polished tutorials then this. I think it is finished, what more does\
      \ it need?</p>\n<p>arg i read it and there is some sloppy coding, i changed\
      \ it, Please don't change it back, it is acutally really bad. And this is a\
      \ newb telling you this. First of all the config part is junk, second of all\
      \ you repeated a lot of parts you didn't have to repeat, third of all the pre-requisites\
      \ are MUCH steeper then what i had in mind ... ok it is so bad i am sequencering\
      \ (&lt;-spelling bad) the whole new section and making one that doesn't suck\
      \ so much later. Please don't put it back, the code is very misleading and wasteful.\
      \ I can't do anything too soon becuase my mouse is broken, sry.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b></p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd>Firstly - Thanks Foxpaw. I was in a hurry and didn't bother to read\
      \ what I'd actually written. Apologies to Mr Bob. for introducing <i>junk</i>\
      \ into his perfect tutorial, and also to Foxpaw for making him come in here\
      \ and fix it.</dd>\n<dd>Mr Bob, just because there are much less polished tutorials\
      \ than this doesn't mean that is one is finished. It just means that the other\
      \ tutorials are not as good. While I agree I repeated a lot of the stuff that\
      \ is covered within the <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealScript_Hello_World\" title=\"\
      Legacy:UnrealScript Hello World\">UnrealScript Hello World</a> tutorial I felt\
      \ it was necessary to make the tutorial complete. You could also argue that\
      \ this would be a better <i>Hello World</i> style tutorial than the existing\
      \ one as it actually does something.</dd>\n<dd>Yes I agree the pre-requisites\
      \ are fairly heavy. However there is actually a fair amount of stuff that you\
      \ need to know, and get right before you even start writing any code.</dd>\n\
      <dd>I'm also fairly sure that the code is broken around the \"health\" area\
      \ but I've not had time to actually compile it and check (I'm relatively sure\
      \ the player's health will get reset to 100 should thep layer actually run over\
      \ a standard health pickup).</dd>\n<dd>I've essentially left the compilation\
      \ and use section for you to complete. When that's done I'll add the GUI elements\
      \ unless you also fill those in.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b> New tutorial,\
      \ in traditional format (me don't like tradition) and the coding is awful, I\
      \ will make a major revision after I get my mouse fixed. I'm just glad entropiclqd\
      \ didn't delete anything important. I thought he was skilled, and maybe he is,\
      \ but it looks like he was trying to make a 2004 GUI and didn't quite complete\
      \ it. You should know that when changing a public page you don't present new\
      \ incomplete code that you haven't even complied and tested. If I complied this\
      \ code, it probably would compile and even if it did, it would be very sloppy\
      \ wasteful code that might glitch the program in a worst case scenario. I don't\
      \ like the traditional format that much, but if you people insist that my tutorial\
      \ look like everyone else's then it shall be. If you complete the 2004 GUI soon\
      \ enough I will forgive you entopiclqd, but if you don't, I'm scraping all your\
      \ work, or at least sequestering it.</p>\n<p>One more point, the pre-requisites\
      \ are completely ridiculous, you don't need the unreal script source code, you\
      \ don't need to have read any of those pages, and I haven't glanced at the terminology\
      \ page. The installed UT2004/3 on your computer is way too obvious. I also don't\
      \ like how you changed it to MutPlayerTweak. NO ONE CHANGE THE ORIGANAL PAGE\
      \ SECTION, good I made my self clear.</p>\n<p>I just turned 15 today&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This isn't a public page yet.</li>\n<li>Tutorials\
      \ should be written for people to follow and understand. Tradition has nothing\
      \ to do with it.</li>\n<li>Thankyou for scrapping all my work. I look forward\
      \ to seeing your alternative offering.</li>\n<li>MutTutorial is a crap name\
      \ for the muator.</li>\n<li>I am indeed an <i>old geezer</i>.</li>\n<li>Happy\
      \ birthday.</li>\n<li>Oh dear - I just changed the original page section.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b> Damn, i thought I deleted the old geezer part, (I did,\
      \ you just looked at the history) i was in a bad mood. Your right, both the\
      \ names are stupid, we need a good name. And I didn't scrap all your work yet,\
      \ i will in five minutes. Your right about the part about tradition, the whole\
      \ time i've been trying to create a downloadable tutorial, so you don't need\
      \ to copy and paste too much, that is what my origanal structure was about.\
      \ Thank you for the happy birthday. Now to look at the origanal page section\
      \ ... YOU DELETED IT!!!&#160;:Pissed: that is very annoying, now I need to harvest\
      \ it from the history. Are you mad at me for calling you an old geezer&#160;:cheesy:\
      \ (i deleted it i tell you). But comeon, that was just pointless. Now to scrap\
      \ most of your changes (i was going to wait a while, but you deleted the origanal\
      \ page, and i have nothing better to do).</p>\n<p>\"sigh\", you could have just\
      \ taken the compiling instructions from the origanal code, but i seems that\
      \ you were too lazy.</p>\n<p>I didn't compleatly scrap everything and a lot\
      \ of the things you said were pretty good, all i ask is that you make a seperate\
      \ page for the 2004 GUI, although i really want you to make one.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ We can leave the GUI part out – the <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator_Config_GUI_(UT2004)\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)\">Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)</a>\
      \ tutorial should be generic enough to work with any mutator (and should be\
      \ tweaked so it works like that). MrBob, if people are too lazy to copy &amp;\
      \ paste instead of downloading, then modding <i>really isn't for them</i>.&#160;:D\
      \ I really don't think it's much of a timesaver, you still need to compile,\
      \ and it's harder for us to maintain it here.</p>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b> Ok fine\
      \ I'll take the download part out.</p>\n<p>Entopiclqd, if you are interested\
      \ in making a GUI for 2004 then look at this .uc file, if you have UT2004 then\
      \ you probably have it, but for your convinance you can download it here: <a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/~theultimatebob/air_control.zip\"\
      >Air Control</a>. As you can tell the file is the air control mutator for UT2004,\
      \ which is vaguly similer to the mutator above. I was not able to make any sense\
      \ of it, or figure out how to tweak it enough to work with health instead of\
      \ air control, but you know much more about Uscript then I do.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ Please see the <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator_Config_GUI_(UT2004)\" title=\"Legacy:Mutator\
      \ Config GUI (UT2004)\">Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)</a> reference page for instructions\
      \ on how to add GUI configuration to your mutator. I will add a discussion section\
      \ at the bottom of that page should you have additional questions. If you find\
      \ youself struggling with the page then I suggest referring to the set of pre-requisites\
      \ I originally added to the tutorial. Calling me an <i>old geezer</i> is in\
      \ no way offensive - I am over twice you age.</p>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b> Kewl, about\
      \ the whole GUI thing, the above link doesn't help me, makes no sense at all.\
      \ Also the volume control mutator, helped a bit more, but doesn't have enough\
      \ comments in the GUI section. So far my most useful resource has been air control.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Like I said above, <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator_Config_GUI_(UT2004)\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)\">Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)</a>\
      \ should give you a template to create a GUI for any given mutator, I hope.\
      \ Since I don't have UT2004 I can't try it for myself. Now as for this page's\
      \ name.... I have altered the listing on the Lessons page to be a bit clearer,\
      \ and I want to do the same to the name. Since the main thing this does is alter\

      \ Message for ppp-62-235-110-208.tiscali.be – thanks for your typo corrections,\
      \ much appreciated! But please don't introduce \"smart quotes\" into the wiki\
      \ text (the &amp;#8217; things) – either turn them off in MS Word or use a text\
      \ editor. Thanks!</p>\n<p><b>Random Guest:</b> Sorry about that.. I don't know\
      \ how that happened, maybe because i'm using IE 5.0. Anyway, this script isn't\
      \ working when I try to compile it. Says MaxHealth isn't a member of xPawn.\
      \ The code-page doesn't use MaxHealth. Maybe this page, or the other needs some\
      \ updating. I deleted the maxhealth thing, since it didn't work. There's HealthMax\
      \ in Pawn, but setting Other.HealtMax gives me another error. I don't know why,\
      \ I'm a newbie. I also had to take it out of the defaultproperties. Now it works.</p>\n\
      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> I don't have the time to test this Mut out but... have you\
      \ tried x.HealthMax instead of just deleteing it completely? I think it's a\
      \ critical part in the mutator... I think without changing the HealthMax property,\
      \ the health can't be set over it's max... which is... 199 I believe? And why\
      \ use Other when you can use x&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> The variable\
      \ I think you want is <a href=\"/Legacy:Pawn\" title=\"Legacy:Pawn\">Pawn</a>.HealthMax.\
      \ MrBob, did you actually TEST this????</p>\n<p><b>Mr.bob:</b> Ya, i tested\
      \ it, three times, but not sense the most recent changes. sry. I'll test it\
      \ now, and update the zip file.</p>\n<p>Yay it compiled&#160;:), now to update\
      \ the zip file.</p>\n<p>Wait those aren't the problem. I see the problem now.\
      \ The problem is that it is \"healthmax\", not \"maxhealth\". I have edited\
      \ the code.</p>\n<p><b>Random Guest:</b> That was indeed the problem. The code\
      \ as it is now works, but there's one small problem. Taking health vials (the\
      \ +5 things) only boosts your health till 199, not till 250 of whatever. Regular\
      \ health packs do get you to 250! Therefore, i would propose this code:</p>\n\
      <div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript\
      \ source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"de1\">    x.<span class=\"me0\">Health</span>\
      \ <span class=\"sy0\">=</span> StartingHealth;\n    x.<span class=\"me0\">HealthMax</span>\
      \ <span class=\"sy0\">=</span> StartingHealth;\n    x.<span class=\"me0\">SuperHealthMax</span>\
      \ <span class=\"sy0\">=</span> HealthMax;</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>This sets\
      \ the paws starting health, as discussed before, says the normal health you\
      \ can reach is the same starting health, and the super health (normally 199)\
      \ is set to the maximum.</p>\n<p>I also made gui-code (mutator settings in the\
      \ configuration-screen), should i post them or is that overkill for this example?</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> It's a little overkill for this example. Also, if the\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator_Config_GUI_(UT2004)\" title=\"Legacy:Mutator Config\
      \ GUI (UT2004)\">Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)</a> page isn't good enough then\
      \ it is that page that should be updated. In terms of the smart-quotes - if\
      \ you edit the tutorial text in Word, they will be added in automatically. And\

      \ And no one ahs responded to my question.&#160;:(</p>\n<p>The mut tutorial\
      \ with GUI has some confusing variable names, for example multijumpboost = multijumpboost\
      \ and healthmax = healthmax , and superhealthmax = superhealthmax. They should\
      \ be changed, in my opinion at least, (Behind my back my brother is compaining\

  wikitext:
    text: "'''Tarquin:''' I don't understand what this is trying to show, or why there\
      \ is no text on that page, only script. Secondly, in your script comments there\
      \ are a number of questions you've left, and a few misconceptions. I suggest\
      \ you get wait for feedback on it first before adding it to the chain of lessons.\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' Imagine you are completely new to Unreal Script.  Is this\
      \ page going to actually help you in [[Legacy:Setting Up UnrealScript|Setting\
      \ Up UnrealScript]] or how to [[Legacy:Set Up Package Folders|Set Up Package\
      \ Folders]].  There's no set of pre-requisites mentioned anywhere or even any\
      \ real explanation of what is going on (note to self - must add them to my tut.\
      \ page).  To my mind the worst thing about the tutorial is that you've assumed\
      \ that someone has downloaded your code.  Try and fit your tutorial into a similar\
      \ structure to the other tutorials on the Wiki.  At least that way all of the\
      \ tutorials will be in a similar form.  Also one of your stated commands will\
      \ not work under Windows XP, and one of them is redundant - but maybe I'm just\
      \ being picky in my old age.\n\n'''Mr.bob''' Uhhhhhhhhhh... what are pre-requisites\
      \ (I mean in  ucode context). Also that is kind of weird because I just used\
      \ this mut in windows xp and it compiled and then worked flawlessly. Also what\
      \ does redundant mean. About the prompt command I think you are talking about,\
      \ I'm surprised it didn't work. Maybe I misspelled it but when I type \"prompt\
      \ $1 into command line in windows XP it gives me a blank prompt which is what\
      \ I want. Finally there is a smiley I've been wanting to try out...<br /> :stupid:\n\
      \nOh ya, most importantly this tutorial was not meant for reading, it was meant\
      \ for downloading as folders a .uc file and a .int file. However that didn't\
      \ seem to work out. In response to Tarquin (who seems to really enjoy messing\
      \ with and moving around my things ... this gives me an idea :cheesy: ) this\
      \ code is trying to give newbs some code that they can mess around with and\
      \ understand. The very first step people do when they are learning to mess with\
      \ code is to do things like replace the word health with shield, and this code\
      \ lets them do that.\n\nLater: Just discovered that all the links I had previously\
      \ posted to the .zip file were broken. Here is one that has to work: [http://www.home.earthlink.net/~doodlethe1/MutNeedBetterName\
      \ THE FILE]\n\nTarquin, why don't you tell me what the misconceptions are so\
      \ I can fix them, you people should really give me a lot more input, although\
      \ the problem is you can't because there are no links to this page.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ things like \"says that there is a local variable that applies only to Xpawns,\
      \ and that varaible is x.\" Please also take care to spell correctly. And please\
      \ remove your tutorial from the list &ndash; you can put the link further down\
      \ the page if you like. You can get it linked by addding a category tag to this\
      \ page.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' The redundant command is indeed the prompt one.\
      \  You might not like to see where you are in the directory structure but I'm\
      \ betting most people (like me) do.  Not only that, but the command is irrelevant.\
      \  You don't need it to compile any Unreal Script at all - but that's not explained.\n\
      : The one I thought wouldn't work under XP was running \"command\".  It does\
      \ work but gives you the old Win9x DOS shell.  The XP version (like NT) is ''cmd''.\n\
      : Pre-requisites in Unreal Script terms are the basic things someone needs to\
      \ know before they can starting writing code.  I linked to them in my previous\
      \ post.  Also, simply downloading some code and then tweaking the values to\
      \ see what they do is a very inefficient way of learning.  A good tutorial does\
      \ the following:\n: * Explains what the tutorial will cover and what the person\
      \ is supposed to learn from doing it.\n: * Explains what the person doing the\
      \ tutorial needs to know in order to complete it.  That is - the assumed ''base\
      \ knowledge'' or as we like to say ''prerequisites''.\n: * Explain in simple\
      \ steps what must be done to accomplish the goal of the tutorial.  At this point\
      \ explaining why things are done (in this case why ModifyPlayer() was used)\
      \ in a lot of detail is necessary.  Your description of ModifyPlayer() is somewhat\
      \ vague &ndash; and could even be misleading.  And also, you should never ever\
      \ leave questions unanswered in a tutorial.\n: * Conclude with a summary of\
      \ what the person is supposed to have learned from the tutorial.\n: So to reiterate\
      \ my original point, simply providing people with some code they can mess about\
      \ with is not a tutorial.  It's also unlikely to help them write their own code\
      \ in the future as it provides no method for understanding why something was\
      \ done in a specific way.\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' At this point I am once again forced\
      \ to admit to my newbishness (is that even a word?) and bow down to your superior\
      \ knowledge. Putting the tutorial on the front page was reckless and hasty (what\
      \ do you expect, I'm 14). I will delete it from the front page and start working\
      \ on one worthy of this terrific site, thx for the advice [[Legacy:EntropicLqd|EntropicLqd]]\
      \ and sorry for bugging you by posting so much junk [[Legacy:Tarquin|Tarquin]].\
      \ A few more points, command, while not as good a cmd still works, but thx anyway\
      \ for the update. Just saying it would help if you included a description of\
      \ what modify player does, considering my description was very incorrect.\n\n\
      Growing up in the age of spell checkers has severely damaged my spelling capabilities.\n\
      \nMy brother is insisting that I keep the things in progress section intact\
      \ with my link in it, but I'm telling him [[Legacy:Tarquin|Tarquin]] isn't going\
      \ to be happy.\n\nWhew, that should do it, the tutorial isn't perfect yet, but\
      \ it is much better then before. It is still not in traditional tutorial format,\
      \ but I don't really like the traditional tutorial format.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ I put some more comments in there to explain some stuff that was a bit misleading.\
      \ However, as you can now see, the comments take up so much space it's hard\
      \ to see the code. What you might consider doing is listing the code in it's\
      \ entirety (without the play by play comments) and then below that take each\
      \ line and show it dissected.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' \"I was sick of lessons like\
      \ the regeneration mutator that would tell you to modify some code you found\
      \ without telling you what that code meant.\" &ndash; I think that is an ''excellent''\
      \ point! We should look into adding a \"How it works\" or \"What's going on\"\
      \ section to our scripting tutorial pages!\n\n'''Mr.Bob's brother:'''  a simple\
      \ note about the prompt $1 thing. we use it because in Windows XP home edition\
      \ you start in this part of the directory structure: <tt>C:/Documents and settings/~username></tt>\
      \ and the UT2004 directory is <tt>C:/UT2004</tt> so we need to make the directory\
      \ structure become blank to go down to C:/.\n\nPS. call me Doodle77 because\
      \ it is my username for a bunch of games\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' The ''prompt''\
      \ command simply changes the DOS prompt.  It ''does not'' change the directory\
      \ you are in.  I suspect you actually meant <CODE>cd c:\\UT2004</CODE>.  If\
      \ you wanted to make the directory structure blank then <CODE>format C:\\</CODE>\
      \ is the command you are after.\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' Never mind, you can type in\
      \ the file path without typing in prompt $1 first, i have changed the script\
      \ apropratly in light of this new discovery.\n\nWow this tutorial is really\
      \ something now. Now i think it can add it to the chain. I will update the .zip\
      \ file with the new code, and add it to the top of the Uscript lessons. The\
      \ full exspanation of what the code means will REALLY help out people who are\
      \ compleate newbs to programing.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Please could you:\n* make\
      \ links in your text\n* add a few headings perhaps\n* fix spelling mistakes\n\
      * explain what the variables you have modified mean\n* I think it would be better\
      \ to remove the explanations from the script entirely, it would make then easier\
      \ to read &ndash; instead of comments within script, a section of text with\
      \ script extracts within it.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Right then Mr.Bob.  Please\
      \ finish off your tutorial in the style it has started in.  If you do a good\
      \ job maybe I'll come back and extend it with information regarding constructing\
      \ a configuration GUI for it.\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' This is what I like about the\
      \ wiki, it is not me writing this tutorial anymore, it is the whole wiki community.\
      \ It's very much like open source code, that is what makes open source programs\
      \ so good and flawless, there is a large amount of people who can look at the\
      \ code and change things.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Maybe, maybe not.  I'm just\
      \ showing you how you should have written it in the first place.  I won't be\
      \ finishing it off for you (and I doubt whether anyone else will) as I don't\
      \ have time.  I certainly won't be restructuing any more of your tutorials if\
      \ they are presented in the manner similar to the way this one was.\n\n'''RegularX:'''\
      \ While I like that more verbal tutes like this are getting written - it should\
      \ be noted that because this is the wiki, tutes like Regen mutator can be appended\
      \ to describe the inner workings of the tutorial itself...\n\n'''Mr.bob:'''\
      \ You said that you wouldn't be finishing it off. Personally I have seen much\
      \ less polished tutorials then this. I think it is finished, what more does\
      \ it need?\n\narg i read it and there is some sloppy coding, i changed it, Please\
      \ don't change it back, it is acutally really bad. And this is a newb telling\
      \ you this. First of all the config part is junk, second of all you repeated\
      \ a lot of parts you didn't have to repeat, third of all the pre-requisites\
      \ are MUCH steeper then what i had in mind ... ok it is so bad i am sequencering\
      \ (<-spelling bad) the whole new section and making one that doesn't suck so\
      \ much later. Please don't put it back, the code is very misleading and wasteful.\
      \ I can't do anything too soon becuase my mouse is broken, sry.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\n\
      : Firstly - Thanks Foxpaw.  I was in a hurry and didn't bother to read what\
      \ I'd actually written.  Apologies to Mr Bob. for introducing ''junk'' into\
      \ his perfect tutorial, and also to Foxpaw for making him come in here and fix\
      \ it.\n: Mr Bob, just because there are much less polished tutorials than this\
      \ doesn't mean that is one is finished.  It just means that the other tutorials\
      \ are not as good.  While I agree I repeated a lot of the stuff that is covered\
      \ within the [[Legacy:UnrealScript Hello World|UnrealScript Hello World]] tutorial\
      \ I felt it was necessary to make the tutorial complete.  You could also argue\
      \ that this would be a better ''Hello World'' style tutorial than the existing\
      \ one as it actually does something.\n: Yes I agree the pre-requisites are fairly\
      \ heavy.  However there is actually a fair amount of stuff that you need to\
      \ know, and get right before you even start writing any code.\n: I'm also fairly\
      \ sure that the code is broken around the \"health\" area but I've not had time\
      \ to actually compile it and check (I'm relatively sure the player's health\
      \ will get reset to 100 should thep layer actually run over a standard health\
      \ pickup).\n: I've essentially left the compilation and use section for you\
      \ to complete.  When that's done I'll add the GUI elements unless you also fill\
      \ those in.\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' New tutorial, in traditional format (me don't like\
      \ tradition) and the coding is awful, I will make a major revision after I get\
      \ my mouse fixed. I'm just glad entropiclqd didn't delete anything important.\
      \ I thought he was skilled, and maybe he is, but it looks like he was trying\
      \ to make a 2004 GUI and didn't quite complete it. You should know that when\
      \ changing a public page you don't present new incomplete code that you haven't\
      \ even complied and tested. If I complied this code, it probably would compile\
      \ and even if it did, it would be very sloppy wasteful code that might glitch\
      \ the program in a worst case scenario. I don't like the traditional format\
      \ that much, but if you people insist that my tutorial look like everyone else's\
      \ then it shall be. If you complete the 2004 GUI soon enough I will forgive\
      \ you entopiclqd, but if you don't, I'm scraping all your work, or at least\
      \ sequestering it.\n\nOne more point, the pre-requisites are completely ridiculous,\
      \ you don't need the unreal script source code, you don't need to have read\
      \ any of those pages, and I haven't glanced at the terminology page. The installed\
      \ UT2004/3 on your computer is way too obvious. I also don't like how you changed\
      \ it to MutPlayerTweak. NO ONE CHANGE THE ORIGANAL PAGE SECTION, good I made\
      \ my self clear.\n\nI just turned 15 today :)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\n* This\
      \ isn't a public page yet.\n* Tutorials should be written for people to follow\
      \ and understand.  Tradition has nothing to do with it.\n* Thankyou for scrapping\
      \ all my work. I look forward to seeing your alternative offering.\n* MutTutorial\
      \ is a crap name for the muator.\n* I am indeed an ''old geezer''.\n* Happy\
      \ birthday.\n* Oh dear - I just changed the original page section.\n\n'''Mr.bob:'''\
      \ Damn, i thought I deleted the old geezer part, (I did, you just looked at\
      \ the history) i was in a bad mood. Your right, both the names are stupid, we\
      \ need a good name. And I didn't scrap all your work yet, i will in five minutes.\
      \ Your right about the part about tradition, the whole time i've been trying\
      \ to create a downloadable tutorial, so you don't need to copy and paste too\
      \ much, that is what my origanal structure was about. Thank you for the happy\
      \ birthday. Now to look at the origanal page section ... YOU DELETED IT!!! :Pissed:\
      \ that is very annoying, now I need to harvest it from the history. Are you\
      \ mad at me for calling you an old geezer :cheesy: (i deleted it i tell you).\
      \ But comeon, that was just pointless. Now to scrap most of your changes (i\
      \ was going to wait a while, but you deleted the origanal page, and i have nothing\
      \ better to do).\n\n\"sigh\", you could have just taken the compiling instructions\
      \ from the origanal code, but i seems that you were too lazy.\n\nI didn't compleatly\
      \ scrap everything and a lot of the things you said were pretty good, all i\
      \ ask is that you make a seperate page for the 2004 GUI, although i really want\
      \ you to make one.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' We can leave the GUI part out &ndash; the\
      \ [[Legacy:Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)|Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)]] tutorial\
      \ should be generic enough to work with any mutator (and should be tweaked so\
      \ it works like that). MrBob, if people are too lazy to copy & paste instead\
      \ of downloading, then modding ''really isn't for them''. :D I really don't\
      \ think it's much of a timesaver, you still need to compile, and it's harder\
      \ for us to maintain it here.\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' Ok fine I'll take the download\
      \ part out.\n\nEntopiclqd, if you are interested in making a GUI for 2004 then\
      \ look at this .uc file, if you have UT2004 then you probably have it, but for\
      \ your convinance you can download it here: [http://home.earthlink.net/~theultimatebob/air_control.zip\
      \ Air Control]. As you can tell the file is the air control mutator for UT2004,\
      \ which is vaguly similer to the mutator above. I was not able to make any sense\
      \ of it, or figure out how to tweak it enough to work with health instead of\
      \ air control, but you know much more about Uscript then I do.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ Please see the [[Legacy:Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)|Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)]]\
      \ reference page for instructions on how to add GUI configuration to your mutator.\
      \  I will add a discussion section at the bottom of that page should you have\
      \ additional questions.  If you find youself struggling with the page then I\
      \ suggest referring to the set of pre-requisites I originally added to the tutorial.\
      \  Calling me an ''old geezer'' is in no way offensive - I am over twice you\
      \ age.\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' Kewl, about the whole GUI thing, the above link doesn't\
      \ help me, makes no sense at all. Also the volume control mutator, helped a\
      \ bit more, but doesn't have enough comments in the GUI section. So far my most\
      \ useful resource has been air control.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Like I said above,\
      \ [[Legacy:Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)|Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)]] should\
      \ give you a template to create a GUI for any given mutator, I hope. Since I\
      \ don't have UT2004 I can't try it for myself. Now as for this page's name....\
      \ I have altered the listing on the Lessons page to be a bit clearer, and I\
      \ want to do the same to the name. Since the main thing this does is alter jumping,\
      \ how about \"SuperJump Mutator Tutorial\"?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Message for ppp-62-235-110-208.tiscali.be\
      \ &ndash; thanks for your typo corrections, much appreciated! But please don't\
      \ introduce \"smart quotes\" into the wiki text (the &amp;#8217; things) &ndash;\
      \ either turn them off in MS Word or use a text editor. Thanks!\n\n'''Random\
      \ Guest:''' Sorry about that.. I don't know how that happened, maybe because\
      \ i'm using IE 5.0. Anyway, this script isn't working when I try to compile\
      \ it. Says MaxHealth isn't a member of xPawn. The code-page doesn't use MaxHealth.\
      \ Maybe this page, or the other needs some updating. I deleted the maxhealth\
      \ thing, since it didn't work. There's HealthMax in Pawn, but setting Other.HealtMax\
      \ gives me another error. I don't know why, I'm a newbie. I also had to take\
      \ it out of the defaultproperties. Now it works.\n\n'''MythOpus:'''  I don't\
      \ have the time to test this Mut out but...  have you tried x.HealthMax instead\
      \ of just deleteing it completely?  I think it's a critical part in the mutator...\
      \  I think without changing the HealthMax property, the health can't be set\
      \ over it's max... which is... 199 I believe?  And why use Other when you can\
      \ use x :) \n\n'''Tarquin:''' The variable I think you want is [[Legacy:Pawn|Pawn]].HealthMax.\
      \ MrBob, did you actually TEST this????\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' Ya, i tested it, three\
      \ times, but not sense the most recent changes. sry. I'll test it now, and update\
      \ the zip file.\n\nYay it compiled :), now to update the zip file.\n\nWait those\
      \ aren't the problem. I see the problem now. The problem is that it is \"healthmax\"\
      , not \"maxhealth\". I have edited the code.\n\n'''Random Guest:''' That was\
      \ indeed the problem. The code as it is now works, but there's one small problem.\
      \ Taking health vials (the +5 things) only boosts your health till 199, not\
      \ till 250 of whatever. Regular health packs do get you to 250! Therefore, i\
      \ would propose this code:\n\n<uscript>\n    x.Health = StartingHealth;\n  \
      \  x.HealthMax = StartingHealth;\n    x.SuperHealthMax = HealthMax;\n</uscript>\n\
      \nThis sets the paws starting health, as discussed before, says the normal health\
      \ you can reach is the same starting health, and the super health (normally\
      \ 199) is set to the maximum.\n\nI also made gui-code (mutator settings in the\
      \ configuration-screen), should i post them or is that overkill for this example?\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' It's a little overkill for this example.  Also, if the\
      \ [[Legacy:Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)|Mutator Config GUI (UT2004)]] page isn't\
      \ good enough then it is that page that should be updated.  In terms of the\
      \ smart-quotes - if you edit the tutorial text in Word, they will be added in\
      \ automatically.  And if you use Notepad remember to turn ''wordwrap'' off.\n\
      \n'''Mr.bob:''' Greetings from saratoga! I've been on vacation and i havn't\
      \ had acess to a computer. Right now I am using the library computer, unfortanatly\
      \ I don't have a apointment and i'm in the childrens section computers (the\
      \ adult comps were full). So they could kick me off at any time.\n\nOk, I'm\
      \ going to change the code so there is super health max. Also random guest,\
      \ if you have this mut with the GUI zip the .uc file(s), put them on your website\
      \ (you have a website right?) and put a link to them. You can also make an extention\
      \ tutorial on the wiki that tells you how to add a GUI to this mutator. Put\
      \ it under the currently existing \"Adding a Configuration Window\" heading.\n\
      \narg the : p_i_s_s_e_d : (ignore the underscores, they have a bunch of wierd\
      \ filtering software on this computer which makes it so I can't write words\
      \ like p_i_s_s. just don't ask) smily is broke! (or is it the filtering software\
      \ on the kidy computers?).\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I don't think SuperHealthMax =\
      \ SuperMaxHealth is  a good choice of variable names.........\n\n'''Mr.bob:'''\
      \ Greating from independent lake camp! Can't think of a better var name sry.\
      \ Also when is random guest going to show me how to make a GUI? Hope it is soon\
      \ :)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' well TRY. Having variables called SuperHealthMax and\
      \ SuperMaxHealth  is just horribly confusing. What is the difference between\
      \ these two vars? How do their names tell me of this difference? If you're going\
      \ to write tutorials, you HAVE to think of this. Also, I don't think this tute\
      \ should contain the GUI &ndash; see what Ent said above.\n\n'''MythOpus:'''\
      \ Instead of using 'x' as a variable.  Couldn't you make life easier by using:\n\
      \n<uscript>\nif (xPawn(Other) != None)\n{\n            xPawn(Other).MaxMultiJump\
      \ = MultiJumpCount;\n            xPawn(Other).MultiJumpBoost = MultiJumpBoost;\n\
      }\n\nOther.Health = StartingHealth;\nOther.HealthMax = MaximumHealth\nOther.SuperHealthMax\
      \ = SuperMaxHealth\n</uscript>\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Mr Bob have you not read\
      \ what has been written in the comments section?  RandomGuest has been specifically\

      \ MR Bob, have you actually read the comments above? Have you read my note about\

      \ Sorry about my laziness tarquin. I'll change the bad var name now.\n\nYou\
      \ are the coolest random guest. Thank you so much. :D :) :D\n\nI tested the\
      \ mutator with the GUI, it works perfectly. After I tweak it and make it bigger,\
      \ i'm going to make a tutorial for it (unless random guest wants to first).\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' I thought this tutorial was meant to be '''simple'''.\n\n'''Random\
      \ Guest:''' Be my guest Mr. bob, make all you like. I don't like typing tutorials\
      \ :-) You can use wotgreal (don't know the link to the page), that expands a\
      \ menu when you type a dot.\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' I meant I would make a different\
      \ tutorial for this, one that would say that it was harder.\n\nDoes anyone know\
      \ what other modifiable things are a part of the class Xpawn, besides the ones\
      \ used above?\n\n'''Mr.bob:''' It's been about 2 months, and the Mut turorial\
      \ code with GUI hasn't been updated. And no one ahs responded to my question.\
      \ :(\n\nThe mut tutorial with GUI has some confusing variable names, for example\
      \ multijumpboost = multijumpboost and healthmax = healthmax , and superhealthmax\
      \ = superhealthmax. They should be changed, in my opinion at least, (Behind\
      \ my back my brother is compaining that those names make it easier and i'm wrong.\n\
      \n'''GRAF1K:''' Your question either is confusingly stated or assumes something\
      \ incorrect, so people are unlikely to respond. Rephrase it and you'll have\
      \ better luck.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' With the variable names, I think you need to\
      \ adopt a scheme that makes it clear which xPawn variable it relates to. Eg,\
      \ \n x.MultiJumpBoost = myMultiJumpBoost ;\n\nand so on.\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ I'm just guessing by the sheer volume of discussion entries that this page\

      \ Ok i've tried this out and i can't get it to compile. I'm a complete noob\
      \ at this also and honestly this tutorial must need a lot of pre-requisites.\
      \ Because i understand very little of what is being asked. The error i get is\
      \ that it doesn't recognise type xPawn, i thought maybe it was a typo so i copy\
      \ and pasted but nothing changed."
