      \ making the cubemap, and the screenshots look very good as well. My only complaint\

      \ Huh? Should water not be translucent, or reflective? What do you suggest?</p>\n\
      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> Well water can be translucent and reflective&#160;:P</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Well, I believe what has been suggested in the past (and is\
      \ what's done by epic) is to blur the living tar out of the cubemap so that\
      \ people wouldn't notice that they can't see themselves in it, while still retaining\
      \ the \"gloss\". By clear, I was referring to the sharpness of the reflection,\
      \ I'd say that it should definately be translucent.</p>\n<p><b>MadNad</b> I\
      \ know for a fact the water is done just like this on antalus. However, at the\
      \ time, I only had a geforce2 gts pro, so I could only use the fallback texture\
      \ technique of antalus. If you use a fluidsurface, it distorts the reflection\
      \ making it very convincing. Whatever floats your boat I suppose. Blurring the\
      \ reflection wouldn't make me believe that I won't be able to see my reflection,\
      \ I would just expect a blurry reflection. I did mean to go back and update\
      \ it now that I have a better vid card, just haven't had time.</p>\n<hr />\n\
