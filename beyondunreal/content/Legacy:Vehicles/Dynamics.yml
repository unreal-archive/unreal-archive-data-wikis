      \ The problem with this is that it does not take into account things like how\
      \ much of the object is submerged. If the top half of a vehicle isn't submerged,\
      \ then buoyancy has less effect than if the entire vehicle is submerged (this\
      \ is ignoring things that change buoyancy such as the vehicle filling with water.),\
      \ so if you're trying to create a boat class, then the object will bounce up\
      \ and down in the water as the object is in the water, is accelerated upwards,\
      \ then is pulled back down by gravity. Most objects in real life stop bouncing\
      \ when they reach an equal point where a small amount of the object is submerged\
      \ and therefore the force caused by the buoyancy and gravity is balanced.</p>\n\

      \ IMO, the <i>Hover-Bike</i> &amp; <i>Helicopter-Thing</i> feel very 'fake'\
      \ (while air-born) because they respond to UI as if they have little (if any)\
      \ weight. Not only that, but all vehicles have a high resistance to being crushed,\
      \ which only serves to decrease their level of <i>value</i> in any situation.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Solid Snake:</b> The is because there is no weight applied onto the raptor\
      \ when it is flying hence there is no reason to continually thrust upwards to\
      \ hover. If you notice the weight value it actually doesn't have any, if you\
      \ add some on it will sink to the ground. Vehicles can't be crushed because\
      \ from memory they ignore encroaching things... Besides UT2004 can't really\
      \ handle crushing things very well...</p>\n<p><b>odo324:</b> The lack of Aerodynamic\
      \ forces isn't really the issue (although I feel it is 'part', I left some specifics\
      \ out). The Raptor in question, acts like a 'ball' that can fly. IE: \"Turning\"\
      . With wheeled vehicles, you can spin out of control, adding a little difficulty\
      \ in performing a quick 180 (something quite fun). Now, rotating of the raptor\
      \ occurs at the center of the front section, but the tail doesnât swing around\
      \ like it should. This prevents any possibility of maneuvering with skill. Of\
      \ course, this subject is debatable in a game like UT'04. It is the first \"\
      real\" appearance of vehicles in <i>Unreal</i>, after all. â At my fault, I\
      \ didn't mean crushed as in \"squished\" but instead their resistance to sudden\
      \ large forces (2 parts). 1) High-Speed collisions with anything, result in\
      \ very little damage. 2) In ut'04, vehicles are 100% functional, or 0% functional.\
      \ Vehicle health has no influence on vehicle-ability, sad. For an example, take\
      \ the Raptor for a high-speed impact into what should be a very damaging obstacle\
      \ (building or cliff) and see how damaged you become&#160;:p.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ I believe that those are design decisions, not really flaws. If vehicles were\
      \ damaged realistically from high speed collisions, vehicles would become very\
      \ unattractive as anyone could take out your vehicle by ramming it with another\
      \ vehicle.</p>\n<p>WRT not losing functionality when damaged, this is also an\
      \ important design decision. The abilities of the vehicles must be carefully\
      \ balanced - any change in capabilities will disrupt this balance. In effect,\
      \ taking only a very small amount of damage would make a vehicle next to useless\
      \ against any other vehicle - making vehiclular combat mostly an issue of \"\
      who hits first,\" sort of like instagib.</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b> Actually, the Manta\
      \ IS a hovercraft. It CAN tip back and forth, but not much. It is held up by\
      \ KRepulsors that ALWAYS repulse downward rather than repulsing the direction\
      \ that the bottom of the craft is facing. If you disable the always upright\
      \ variable in it's KarmaParams then it'll continue to repulse downwards even\
      \ while flipped. It has 3 KRepulsors, 1 in the front, 1 on each side. Because\
      \ of this, it leans back while ducking because there is no KRepulsor there to\
      \ hold it up.</p>\n<p><b>5parrowhawk:</b> Making the Manta behave more \"realistically\"\
      \ is not excessively difficult. For swaying/rocking, it's simply a matter of\
      \ altering its center of gravity and adjusting the parameters of the repulsors\
      \ (e.g. to increase softness). You'll want to set bStayUpright to false in any\
      \ case, which will help too. Finally, you'll need to set the penetration direction\
      \ of the repulsors, every tick, to match the vehicle's rotation (not too hard\
      \ either). The real question is whether this would improve gameplay very much\
      \ (or, indeed, at all).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comments\"\

    text: "Physics as they apply to vehicles.\n\n* Unlike the [[Legacy:Vehicles/Anatomy|Anatomy]]\
      \ page, '''no subPages''' exist for specific types (''land, air, sea...'')\n\
      * Any ''Unreal'' references may or may not be [[Legacy:Karma|Karma]] related.\
      \ Just keep in mind that Karma does have its own page!\n\n==Real==\n\nVarious\
      \ forces that act upon ANY vehicle in real life. Under most circumstances, every\
      \ object has these four basic forces acting upon it.\n\n===Basic Forces===\n\
      \n====Thrust====\n: The force generated to enable forward motion of an object.\n\
      \n====Drag====\n: The force that resists forward motion of an object.\n* Aerodynamics\
      \ - this is caused by an object moving through a fluid. The fluid isn't going\
      \ to move out of the way by itself, so the object must use ''thrust'' to overcome\
      \ this resulting ''drag'' and 'squeeze' it's way through.\n* Friction - A measure\
      \ of how hard it is to slide one object over another\n** This is <u>one</u>\
      \ cause of ''drag''.\n** Coefficient of Friction ('''&mu;''') == Force Applied\
      \ ('''F<sub> App</sub>''') / Weight ('''w''' == Mass * Gravity )\n\n====Lift====\n\
      : The force that resists the weight of an object.\n* '''Land-based Vehicles:'''\
      \ The 'land' itself applies an equal & opposite force to the weight.\n* '''Winged\
      \ Vehicles:''' ''Lift'' is generated through pressure variations caused by turning\
      \ a moving fluid. Confused? I often imagine it like this: the shape of an object\
      \ creates changes in air/fluid pressure when moving. The wings on a plane are\
      \ designed to \"manipulate\" and \"ride\" that pressure change like a wave.\n\
      * '''Hovering Vehicles:''' Hovering is often generated from a downward ''thrust''\
      \ to cause ''lift'', though forward thrust is non-existent.\n* '''Balloon Vehicles:'''\
      \ Blimps, use buoyancy to generate lift. Since air, like water, is a form of\
      \ fluid... it too has a level of buoyancy.\n\n====Weight====\n: The force generated\
      \ as a result of gravity.\n* Weight = Mass * Gravity\n\n===Other Forces===\n\
      \n====Friction====\n: The measurement of the force it takes to slide one object\
      \ over another.\n* Friction occurs due to the microscopic interactions of two\
      \ surfaces.\n* Example: Imagine rubbing two sheets of sandpaper together. The\
      \ force keeping the two sheets together causes their roughness to also squeeze\
      \ closer together. The greater the force, the more difficult it is to rub the\
      \ sheets together; this is friction.\n\n====Traction====\n: A measurement of\
      \ the 'grip' a vehicle has on it's surroundings.\n: ''NOTE:'' This is being\
      \ approached as a form of ''grabbing'' (through friction) and then ''pulling''\
      \ (through centripetal force). Possibly the most common vision is \"the grip\
      \ a tire has on the road\".\n* As traction increases, typically ''thrust'' increases\
      \ and ''drag'' decreases. The actual amount of 'change' is dependent on the\
      \ density of the surrounding fluid (be it liquid or gas) and the maximum amount\
      \ of traction the driving surface has.\n* The ratio of ''thrust'' to ''drag''\
      \ of the vehicle's tread is an occasional factor to consider. A tread comprised\
      \ of long spikes would provide superior traction but greatly decrease it's ability\
      \ to provide thrust.\n* Surface Type - The type of surface affects the level\
      \ of traction that can be obtained.\n** Small objects producing a surface -\
      \ It is the individual shape (rocks vs. marbles) and collective density (Packed\
      \ Gravel vs. Loose Gravel) that comprise the actual traction of the resulting\
      \ surface.\n** Surface Modifiers ~ ( Dirt Road + Water = Muddy Road )\n\n====Buoyancy====\n\
      : Most vehicles have an initial buoyancy level, since the air inside cant always\
      \ escape b4 the vehicle becomes submerged.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\n\n====Level\
      \ Flying====\n: ''Both'' these equations must be true. Remember: the ''change''\
      \ in speed will also change the amount of ''lift'' on the wings. Only a constant\
      \ speed will provide a constant ''lift'', enabling the plane to fly level.\n\
      * Thrust == Drag\n* Lift == Weight\n\n''Note:'' When ''thrust'' equals ''drag'',\
      \ speed isn't eliminated but will remain constant. Similarly, elevation is constant\
      \ when ''lift'' equals ''weight''.\n:'''odo324:''' Took me quite a while b4\
      \ I figured out this one :rolleyes:.\n\n====Changing Altitude====\n* Ascending\
      \ (+) == ''Lift'' > ''Weight''\n* Descending (-) == ''Lift'' < ''Weight''\n\n\
      ====Changing Speed====\n* Accelerating (+) == ''Thrust'' > ''Drag''\n* Decelerating\
      \ (-) == ''Thrust'' < ''Drag''\n\n===Natural States===\n\nStates that are ''NOT''\
      \ powered by the vehicle. (''\"Driving\" would not be one, but \"Rolling\" would.'')\n\
      \n====Diving====\n* Vehicles should have an initial buoyancy factor, representing\
      \ the maximum amount of buoyancy it can have (due to air being initially trapped\
      \ inside).\n* A vehicle's initial buoyancy will decrease immediately when it\
      \ starts to take on water. However, this doesn't mean it will immediately sink.\n\
      ** The <u>slower</u> a vehicle travels into water, the <u>less of a chance</u>\
      \ its buoyancy will be enough for it to momentarily float.\n** The <u>faster</u>\
      \ a vehicle travels into water, the <u>greater a chance</u> its buoyancy will\
      \ be enough for it to momentarily float.\n\n====Sinking====\n: If the vehicle\
      \ 'could' take on water (as most do), its buoyancy should rapidly decrease (sinking\
      \ it).\n\n====Submerged====\n: Underwater (or any ''liquid''), ''drag'' is greatly\
      \ increased due to the higher density of the water.\n\n----\n\n==UT2004==\n\n\
      How the Unreal Engine mimics these forces.\n\n===Thrust===\n\nGetting pawns\
      \ to move forward.\n\n====Appling thrust to a [[Legacy:KCar|KCar]] Wheel====\n\
      \nThe TorqueCurve is used for applying thrust to the wheel. It's defined like\
      \ this:\n\n<uscript>var (KCar) InterpCurve\tTorqueCurve; // Engine RPM in, Torque\
      \ out.\n\ndefaultproperties\n{\n\tTorqueCurve=(Points=(\n\t\t\t\t\t(InVal=0,\t\
      \tOutVal=150),\n\t\t\t\t\t(InVal=245756,\tOutVal=150),\n\t\t\t\t\t(InVal=491512,\t\
      OutVal=0)\n\t\t\t\t))\n}</uscript>\n\nThe variable \"''Points''\" can be read\
      \ like this:\n\n{|\n\n|-\n|Starting at this '''Speed'''...\n|...'''Effect'''...\n\
      |'''Change''' per. ??? [[:Category:Legacy Answer Needed]] \n|-\n|0\n|A static\

      \ begins to drop (linarly?).\n|150 \n|-\n|491512\n|Maximum speed is reached.\
      \ No more acceleration.\n|0 \n|}\n\n===Drag===\n\nWhat keep holding back pawns.\n\
      \n===Lift===\n\nKeeping pawns in the air.\n* '''Hovering Vehicles'''\n*: '''odo324:'''\
      \ A good ''visual'' example (in a game) that uses a single form of thrust ''to\
      \ hover'' and ''for propulsion'' is the \"Hydra\" Fighter Jet seen in GTA: San\
      \ Andreas. Its hovering jets are redirected to enable thrust.\n*: Regarding\
      \ UT2004's \"Hover Bike\"? Unknown but I truly doubt it's created in this manner\
      \ of downward ''thrust''. Sadly, it act's more like a wheeled vehicle that has\
      \ low traction, no tires, and has low mass.\n*: I've come to this conclusion\
      \ because... ''(excluding the \"Destroyed\" vehicle state)''\n*:# ..it ''can't''\
      \ snag the ground.\n*:# ..it ''can't'' tip left/right from an impact.\n*:# ..it\
      \ ''doesn't'' travel backward when tilted backward (''holding \"crouch\"'').\n\
      \n===Weight===\n\nGetting pawns to fall and how the engine enables it to fall.\n\
      \n===Friction===\n\nHow ''Unreal'' vehicles simulate 'friction'.\n\n===Traction===\n\
      \nHow ''Unreal'' vehicles are able to 'grip' their environment.\n\n===Buoyancy===\n\
      \nKarma handles buoyancy by adding a bit of force to an object that is touching\
      \ water. The problem with this is that it does not take into account things\
      \ like how much of the object is submerged. If the top half of a vehicle isn't\
      \ submerged, then buoyancy has less effect than if the entire vehicle is submerged\
      \ (this is ignoring things that change buoyancy such as the vehicle filling\
      \ with water.), so if you're trying to create a boat class, then the object\
      \ will bounce up and down in the water as the object is in the water, is accelerated\
      \ upwards, then is pulled back down by gravity. Most objects in real life stop\
      \ bouncing when they reach an equal point where a small amount of the object\
      \ is submerged and therefore the force caused by the buoyancy and gravity is\
      \ balanced.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\n\n===Natural Vehicle States===\n\n====Diving====\n\
      \n====Sinking====\n* Initial Buoyancy Factor\n*: '''odo324:''' Say a vehicle\
      \ was only submerged 40% and unable to sink further, than its buoyancy should\
      \ stop decreasing once roughly 40% of is submerged.\n\n====Submerged====\n\n\
      ===Code===\n\nSome of these examples could be quite simple but are perhaps not\
      \ obvious to everyone.\n\n====In-Game Examples====\n: Example snippets ''from''\

      \n'''odo324:''' IMO, the ''Hover-Bike'' & ''Helicopter-Thing'' feel very 'fake'\
      \ (while air-born) because they respond to UI as if they have little (if any)\
      \ weight. Not only that, but all vehicles have a high resistance to being crushed,\
      \ which only serves to decrease their level of ''value'' in any situation.\n\
      \n'''Solid Snake:''' The is because there is no weight applied onto the raptor\
      \ when it is flying hence there is no reason to continually thrust upwards to\
      \ hover. If you notice the weight value it actually doesn't have any, if you\
      \ add some on it will sink to the ground. Vehicles can't be crushed because\
      \ from memory they ignore encroaching things... Besides UT2004 can't really\
      \ handle crushing things very well...\n\n'''odo324:''' The lack of Aerodynamic\
      \ forces isn't really the issue (although I feel it is 'part', I left some specifics\
      \ out). The Raptor in question, acts like a 'ball' that can fly. IE: \"Turning\"\
      . With wheeled vehicles, you can spin out of control, adding a little difficulty\
      \ in performing a quick 180 (something quite fun). Now, rotating of the raptor\
      \ occurs at the center of the front section, but the tail doesnât swing around\
      \ like it should. This prevents any possibility of maneuvering with skill. Of\
      \ course, this subject is debatable in a game like UT'04. It is the first \"\
      real\" appearance of vehicles in ''Unreal'', after all. &rarr; At my fault,\
      \ I didn't mean crushed as in \"squished\" but instead their resistance to sudden\
      \ large forces (2 parts). 1) High-Speed collisions with anything, result in\
      \ very little damage. 2) In ut'04, vehicles are 100% functional, or 0% functional.\
      \ Vehicle health has no influence on vehicle-ability, sad. For an example, take\
      \ the Raptor for a high-speed impact into what should be a very damaging obstacle\
      \ (building or cliff) and see how damaged you become :p.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I\
      \ believe that those are design decisions, not really flaws. If vehicles were\
      \ damaged realistically from high speed collisions, vehicles would become very\
      \ unattractive as anyone could take out your vehicle by ramming it with another\
      \ vehicle.\n\nWRT not losing functionality when damaged, this is also an important\
      \ design decision. The abilities of the vehicles must be carefully balanced\
      \ - any change in capabilities will disrupt this balance. In effect, taking\
      \ only a very small amount of damage would make a vehicle next to useless against\
      \ any other vehicle - making vehiclular combat mostly an issue of \"who hits\
      \ first,\" sort of like instagib. \n\n'''T1:''' Actually, the Manta IS a hovercraft.\
      \ It CAN tip back and forth, but not much. It is held up by KRepulsors that\
      \ ALWAYS repulse downward rather than repulsing the direction that the bottom\
      \ of the craft is facing. If you disable the always upright variable in it's\
      \ KarmaParams then it'll continue to repulse downwards even while flipped. It\
      \ has 3 KRepulsors, 1 in the front, 1 on each side. Because of this, it leans\
      \ back while ducking because there is no KRepulsor there to hold it up.\n\n\
      '''5parrowhawk:''' Making the Manta behave more \"realistically\" is not excessively\
      \ difficult. For swaying/rocking, it's simply a matter of altering its center\
      \ of gravity and adjusting the parameters of the repulsors (e.g. to increase\
      \ softness). You'll want to set bStayUpright to false in any case, which will\
      \ help too. Finally, you'll need to set the penetration direction of the repulsors,\
      \ every tick, to match the vehicle's rotation (not too hard either). The real\
      \ question is whether this would improve gameplay very much (or, indeed, at\
      \ all).\n\n----\n\n==Comments==\n\n'''odo324:''' Oh, may the wiki gods forgive\
      \ me! Honestly, I no references as to 'how' Unreal simulates this stuff (YET!).\
      \ I'm starting with real-life info and add Unreal references as I find them.\
      \ I hope others may do the same.\n[[Category:Legacy Answer Needed|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
