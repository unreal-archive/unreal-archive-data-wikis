      \ this section exists to help people understand and code realism into their\
      \ vehicle.\n\n:tup: ''If any 'factoids' can be better summarized with an equation,\
      \ please edit them freely. Just make sure others will know what the equation\
      \ is for.''\n\n===Engines===\n\nSupplies the power needed for the vehicle to\
      \ function.\n\n; Gasoline: An internal combustion engine used in many vehicles\
      \ today.\n;* Compresses at a ratio of 8:1 to 12:1.\n; Diesel: An internal combustion\
      \ engine.\n;* Better power efficiency then a car engine due to a higher compression\
      \ ratio of ''14:1'' to as high as ''25:1''.\n;* '''2 Stroke Diesel:''' Can be\
      \ found in many diesel locomotives, large ships, and generating facilities.\n\
      ;** Horsepower typically rates at 4,300!\n; Rotary:\n;* Slower and fewer moving\
      \ parts makes a more reliable engine.\n;* Produces little if any vibrations.\n\
      ;* Produces 3x the power of standard cylinder engines. (This may not be accurate:\
      \ my source (HowStuffWorks.com) says ''smoother power'' not ''more power''?!?)\n\
      ;* Low air/fuel compression ratio\n;** Uses more fuel.\n;** Typically not environmentally\
      \ friendly.\n; Gas Turbine: Also known as the \"Jet Engine\" because you see\
      \ them on nearly all jets.\n;* You can find them on many jets, some helicopters,\
      \ small power plants, and even the M-1 Tank!\n;* Typically creates ~1,500 horsepower.\n\
      ;* The amount of power generated is very good, compared to their weight.\n;*\
      \ Smaller than their reciprocating (''Cylinder, Rotary, etc'') counterparts\
      \ of the same power.\n;* They tend to use more fuel when they are idling.\n\
      ;* Variations:\n;** Turbofan: Used for large Jetliners, the engine is housed\
      \ inside another cylinder shape casing with a larger fan in front. This is done\
      \ to improve ''thrust'' by dramatically increasing the amount of air moving\
      \ through the engine.\n;** Turboprop: Similar to a turbofan, a slower-moving\
      \ propeller is used instead of a fan.\n; Radial: Pistons are arranged in a radial\
      \ fashion, perpendicular to the 'main rod' that powers the pistons.\n;* ~1,200\
      \ horsepower.\n;* With their inherit low RPM, they can directly power airplane\
      \ propellers.\n;* Today, you can still see a 2 cylinder version in many motorcycles.\n\
      ; Steam: Generally... Water is broiled to produce steam. This steam is diverted\
      \ to alternating side of a piston to produce a usable force.\n; Sterling: An\
      \ extremely efficient engine that uses the natural changes in pressure (due\
      \ to rapid temp changes) to alternate motion between two pistons.\n;* Has no\
      \ standard design.\n;* Needs external Heating and Cooling sources.\n;* No combustion\
      \ takes place inside.\n;** No Explosions.\n;** No intake or exhaust.\n; 4-Stroke:\
      \ Fire once/2 revolutions.\n;* Orientation - May have problems with oil flow\
      \ unless upright. Solving this problem can add complexity and weight to the\
      \ engine.\n; Two-Stroke: Fire once/revolution, twice more than their 4-Stroke\
      \ equilivants.\n;* Can be found in: ''Dirt bikes, Mopeds, Jet skis, Small outboard\
      \ motors,'' and ''Radio-controlled model planes''.\n;* Works correctly in any\
      \ orientation.\n;* No valves (ie: lighter and simpler engines).\n;* 2x better\
      \ power/weight ratio than 4-Stroke equivalent.\n;* Not as reliable, lacking\
      \ any dedicated lubrication system.\n;* Not fuel efficient!\n;* Produces a lot\
      \ of pollution.\n; Rocket: A reaction system is used for propulsion.\n;* The\
      \ ''action'' is to throw some mass in one direction, the ''reaction'' is to\
      \ move in the opposite direction.\n;* Typical rocket exhaust velocities for\
      \ chemical rockets range between 5,000 and 10,000 mph!\n;* Must carry everything\
      \ it expels for thrust (ie: ''fuel'').\n;* Solid-Propellant Rockets:\n;** Thrust\
      \ cannot be controlled.\n;** Once ignited, the engine cannot be stopped or restarted.\n\
      ;* Liquid-Propellant Rockets: Fuel and an oxidizer are pumped into a combustion\
      \ chamber, burned, and the resulting high-pressure gases are expelled at high-velocities.\
      \ These gases flow through a nozzle that accelerates them even faster.\n;**\
      \ Typical exit-velocities run from 5,000 to 10,000 mph!\n\n====Others====\n\
      * HEMI Engines\n* NASCAR Engines\n* Champ Car Engines\n\n===Transmissions===\n\
      \nAllows the gear ratio between the engine and the drive wheels to change as\
      \ the car speeds up and slows down.\n; Manual Transmission: Gears are shifted\
      \ manually by the driver.\n; Clutches: Temporary connects the engine to the\
      \ transmission, as long as the 'gas' peddle is being pressed. This enables the\
      \ wheels to slow down and completely stop while the engine is still running.\n\
      ; Automatic Transmissions: Gears are shifted automatically.\n; Torque Converters:\
      \ Has the same function as a clutch, for Automatic Transmission vehicles.\n\n\
      ===Drive Train===\n; Brakes: Uses leverage, hydraulics, and friction to apply\
      \ friction to the wheels.\n;* Break Types: ''Drum, Disc, Power, and Anti-Lock''.\n\
      ;*** Vehicles in UT'04 (and previous) do not have the anti-lock ability.\n;\
      \ Wheels: Enables the car to ''pull'' itself on land.\n;* Hydroplaning: If water\
      \ can't escape from under the tire quickly enough, the tire will lift off the\
      \ ground and be supported by only the water. Because the wheels will have nearly\
      \ zero traction. The vehicle is likely to veer out of control.\n;* Coefficient\
      \ of Rolling Friction: A measurement of how much ''drag'' (or ''rolling resistance'')\
      \ is caused from the rolling wheels.\n;** Force needed to move on Wheels: Force\
      \ Applied ('''F<sub> App</sub>''') == Weight * (Coefficient of Rolling Friction)\n\

      \ not'') seem, these things could be simulated for that extra 'coolness' factor\
      \ :cool:.\n\n; Cruise Control Systems: Allows a vehicle to maintain its speed\
      \ without user interaction.\n;* Disengages when the break peddle is used.\n\
      ;* Adaptive Cruise Control - This new feature will adjust vehicle speed to adapt\
      \ to traffic ahead. When the road is again clear, the cruise control will gradually\
      \ return to its original set speed.\n; Gauges: Fuel, oil, temp, etc...\n; Odometers:\
      \ Keeps track of the distance driven (in miles or kilometers).\n; Door Locks:\
      \ Keeps others from entering, :rolleyes: duh.\n;* Remote Entry: Lock/Unlock\
      \ your vehicle from a distance.\n; Windows: Player in Vehicle + Gun + Window\
      \ + Enemy... You do the math.\n; Turbochargers: Compresses the air-intake before\
      \ it enters the engine. This enables the engine squeeze more air into a cylinder,\
      \ meaning that more fuel can be added. Therefore, you significantly improve\
      \ the power-to-weight ratio for the engine.\n;* Overuse may result in \"Knock\"\
      . In such a situation, the temperature is hot enough to ignite the fuel before\
      \ the spark plug fires! This is caused by an accumulation of heat do to the\
      \ continuous over-compression of air.\n;* Turbo Lag: It takes a second for the\
      \ turbine to get up to speed before any boost is produced. A common way to combat\
      \ this is to reduce the inertia of the rotating parts by making them lighter.\n\
      ;* The size of the charger inversely affects ''speed'' and level of capable\
      \ ''boost''.\n;** ''Large'' -> Slower with more Boost.\n;** ''Small'' -> Faster\
      \ with less Boost.\n;* A Watergate may be used to hookup a small 'extra' turbocharger,\
      \ reducing ''Turbo Lag''.\n; Turn Signals: Take a wild guess O_O.\n;* Today,\
      \ it's typical for a car to automatically disengage an active signal when the\
      \ steering wheel reaches a specified angle of rotation.\n;* Vehicles that have\
      \ extra signal lights behind the side mirrors are already starting to appear.\n\
      ;Windshield Wipers: Keep the windshield clear of precipitation.\n;* Wiper Arrangements:\n\
      ;** The Tandem System - Typical setup in cars, this arrangement has the blades\
      \ always running in parallel to each other. One blade is positioned specifically\
      \ for the ''driver'', while another is positioned for the larger coverage of\
      \ the ''center'' and ''opposite side'' of the windshield.\n;** Opposed system\
      \ - The 2 blades are each mounted below opposite sides of the windshield. While\
      \ this covers each side of the windshield, the top of the middle windshield\
      \ area is obviously unreachable.\n;** Single Arm - A single blade mounted below\
      \ the center of the windshield. This configuration is often seen on the back\
      \ of minivans.\n;** Single Arm (Controlled) - Like the \"Single Arm\" setup,\
      \ except it moves with its rotation for maximum coverage of the windshield.\n\
      ;* The ''speed'' and ''precipitation level'' is directly proportional to ''the\
      \ wipers ability to keep the windshield clear''. In other words: \"the ''faster''\
      \ the car is traveling\" and \"the ''more precipitation'' that occurs\"... the\
      \ more rain that will impact the windshield, making it harder for the wipers\
      \ to keep the windshield clear.\n;* The faster the blades move, the more precipitation\
      \ they can handle.\n\n''Note: A few items are <u>almost</u> pointless to simulate\
      \ in Unreal and are listed only for clarity (ex: \"Torque Converters\", if basically\
      \ simulated, would only need a couple lines of code). Some are listed for that\
      \ <u>rare</u> circumstance that someone might wish to simulate it (like \"Windshield\
      \ Wipers\").''\n\n==Code==\n\nCode that provides ''to-the-point'' explanations\
      \ of how individual parts of a vehicle can be simulated in ''Unreal''.\n\n===In-Game\

      \n==To Do:==\n* Convert all occurrences of ''horsepower'' to something more\
      \ useful.\n* ''Compression ratios'' should be rewritten as a set of equations\
      \ describing general ''fuel efficiency''.\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''odo324:'''\
      \ This was a very difficult page to do! What ''could'' and ''couldn't'' be \"\
      relevant\" on an UnrealWiki page is very unpredictable! Also, as we document\
      \ ''Unreal'' equivalents to ''real'' vehicle anatomy, this page-layout will\
      \ almost certainly need to be modified.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' This seems to exist\
      \ somewhere between [[Legacy:Mod Ideas|Mod Ideas]], [[Legacy:Movement Metrics\
      \ (UT2003)|Movement Metrics (UT2003)]] and a reference that should belong outside\
      \ UnrealWiki.  I see the connection being made, but it's a strain to see how\
      \ useful this is to UnrealScript.  At best, I can see a useful comparison between\
      \ the transfer of energy in an engine, versus the chain of events in the control\
      \ of an Unreal vehicle.\n\n'''StarWeaver:''' It's a . . . very bizarre page,\
      \ for sure. I didn't even get the point till I'd read most of it. The author's\
      \ claim of keeping the real and unreal seperated at the top seems moot, as it's\
      \ almost all random information about real physics and vehicles. The detail-level\
      \ of information is very . . . random, between topics, too. I would want to\
      \ change this to be essentially \"Here's how engine types A and B work briefly,\
      \ here's what to consider in simulating them in code and how the real life differences\
      \ correpsond to code differences, here's links to all the different kinds of\
      \ engines work on wikipedia. Here's a list of all the other components that\
      \ you might forget to consider when making a vehicle, and any real-life<->game\
      \ considerations that come to mind abuot them, here's links to real-world info.\"\
      \ . . . . I don't have nearly enough knowledge to put something like this together\
      \ currently, though.\n\n'''sweavo:''' IMO this should be under the personal\
      \ pages of the person who wrote it.  There's probably some interesting info\
      \ here, but none of it about UT."
