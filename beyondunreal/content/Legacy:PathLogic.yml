    text: "<p>Pathlogic's objective is to allow a mapper to add a variety of navigation\
      \ points to his/her map while playing the map, rather than from within UEd.\
      \ If you're pathing one small map, learning and using Pathlogic may be more\
      \ trouble than its worth. If, however, you have a large map to path or you crank\
      \ maps out like link sausages, it will probably be worth your while.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ basic mechanism behind Pathlogic is a subclassed <a href=\"/Legacy:PlayerPawn\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:PlayerPawn\">PlayerPawn</a> (that you use during a \"Pathing\
      \ Session\" ) that spawns special subclass markers... either when you push a\
      \ button or at intervals. These \"markers\" show up in the map like pathnodes,\
      \ players starts, etc., but their sprites are slightly altered so you can tell\
      \ what they are. Every time you poop one out, it logs what type it is and its\
      \ XZY location. When you exit the game, Pathlogic then examines the UT Log file\
      \ and collects information from Pathlogic specific entries it finds. It uses\
      \ these entries to mock up a <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:T3D?redlink=1\" class=\"\
      new\" title=\"Legacy:T3D (page does not exist)\">T3D</a> map that you can then\
      \ import into your existing map. Generally, the concept was easy... its the\
      \ details that took some time.</p>\n<p>Here is a quick list of the <a href=\"\
      /edit/Legacy:Navigation_Point?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Navigation\
      \ Point (page does not exist)\">Navigation Points</a> Pathlogic will let you\
      \ place:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Regular <a href=\"/Legacy:PathNode\" title=\"Legacy:PathNode\"\
      >PathNode</a></li>\n<li>OneWay Pathnodes</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Legacy:AlternatePath\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:AlternatePath\">AlternatePath</a> node</li>\n<li><a href=\"\
      /Legacy:PlayerStart\" title=\"Legacy:PlayerStart\">PlayerStart</a></li>\n<li><a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:LiftCenter\" title=\"Legacy:LiftCenter\">LiftCenter</a> &amp;\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:LiftExit_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:LiftExit (UT)\">LiftExit\
      \ (UT)</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>For Alternate Pathnodes, there's a console command\
      \ for setting bReturnOnly, SelectionWeight, and the Team value. If you change\
      \ any of these three settings, all subsequent AlternatePathnodes placed will\
      \ use those settings.</p>\n<p>LiftCenter and LiftExit placement was very challenging\
      \ to code up... but work great and saves a lot of time. You don't even have\
      \ to key in the tag names or anything. Just change to Elevator Mode (which drops\
      \ a lift exit), step onto the elevator (which starts 4 seconds later then places\
      \ the LiftCenter), then step off and change out of Elevator Mode( which drops\
      \ the second lift exit). The 4 second delay is temporarily added to all StandOpenedTimed\
      \ movers when you enter the game. This was necessary to give you time to center\
      \ yourself on the lift before it starts moving. Learn to use Elevator Mode...its\
      \ a big time saver.</p>\n<p>Placement of the various pathnodes can be done manually\
      \ (a key alias is best) or automatically at intervals you can set. When pathnodes\
      \ are placed, Pathlogic will even check for crowding with other nav points...and\
      \ give you a little warning beep and a message. The crowding clearance can be\
      \ set via the console as well.</p>\n<p>If you misplace nodes, no worries...there's\
      \ an Erase Mode. Simple change to Erase Mode and bump into the misplaced nav\
      \ point and it will vanish. Know, however, that placing AND erasing are both\
      \ considered operations and currently Pathlogic will only log up to about 2000\
      \ operations. I've found, however, that this can accomodate one hell of a big\
      \ map.</p>\n<p>Now, back to what I said at the top: Pathlogics basic mechanism\
      \ uses a subclassed PlayerPawn. How do you select this as your player when you\
      \ want to path a map? You don't!!! Simply launch Pathlogic.EXE, it will find/save\
      \ your User.INI file, change the player model to the new subclass, launch UT\
      \ for you, then restore your User.INI file when you're done.</p>\n<p>For the\
      \ complete description of Pathlogic, see its associated .TXT file in its ZIP\
      \ archive. Many web sites have the zip for download...or you can get it off\
