      \ It displays all edits, file uploads, page moves, deletions and other actions\

      \ your display: limit the number of changes shown, the number of days or restrict\
      \ it to edits to a certain namespace. You can also hide edits marked as minor\
      \ (don't forget that major changes can be flagged by a user as minor anyway).</p>\n\
      <p>One line in recentchanges consists of several links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>diff</i>\
      \ displays the difference to the previous revision of the page,</li>\n<li><i>hist</i>\
      \ links to the revision history of the page,</li>\n<li>the link with the full\
      \ title of the page brings you to the current version. If the title is in bold,\
      \ it indicates that it is on your watchlist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next is a flag\
      \ describing the article modification type:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>N</i> signalizes\
      \ a new page,</li>\n<li><i>m</i> a minor edit,</li>\n<li><i>b</i> an edit made\
      \ by a bot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the timestamp the user is mentioned, with\

      \ page</a> and their <a href=\"/Help:Talk_pages#User_Talk_pages\" title=\"Help:Talk\
      \ pages\">talk page</a> or to their contributions (in the case of anonymous\
      \ users).</p>\n<p>Last but not least, there is an edit summary, appearing in\
      \ italics, if the user submitted one when they made the edit.</p>\n<h3><span\
