      <p>Well, so, I've fallen victim to the thing that happens to most new coders...\
      \ I started a project that's too big. Okay, so it's actually going very well,\
      \ but I just don't have time to code up so many weapon classes for this. Anyone\
      \ who wanted to help would of course be welcome to, but I very much doubt anyone\
      \ else is even interested in this, so I'm going to cut it down and attempt to\
      \ produce a much smaller mutator which adds flyability to all players. Not quite\
      \ sure if bot AI can be extended to cope with the ability to fly, and I very\
      \ much doubt I can actually pull that off even if it is possible (I did one\
      \ AI module and decided it's not for me, so now I'm a programming language theorist\
      \ instead). If anyone could help with that, I would be greatly appreciative\
      \ - but I'd better get it working for multiplayer first I think so the bots\
      \ have something to be taught!</p>\n<p>It also occurred to me that I'd do a\
      \ lot more of this stuff <b>if the development tools were available on Linux</b>.\
      \ I'm not talking about UnrealEd, I hardly ever use that anyway. All I need\
      \ is <b>ucc make</b> and the ability to use my custom code with the Linux client\
      \ (which I currently can't do, it just ignores it - does anyone by any chance\
      \ happen to know how that works? I should go search forums).</p>\n<h3><span\

      <p>Sorcery has recently gained a mutator which recharges the SorceryAmmo pool,\
      \ thus acting as a regenerating Mana pool without having to reimplement too\
      \ much stuff. The problem is going to be balancing recharge rate with the amount\
      \ of Mana the various spells are going to be using, but playtesting is the only\
      \ way to find that. For testing purposes, I just crank it right up so I have\
      \ effectively infinite ammo, and can get a good feel for if the weapons are\
      \ working. The mutator still needs to have the ability to swap out conventional\
      \ weapons for spells though. Code-wise, this has been fairly easy, just requiring\
      \ some adaptation of the code from the Regeneration and InstaGib mutators.</p>\n\
      <p>I have also implemented another spell, which isn't on the original ideas\
      \ list and might get dropped again - but it's quite fun and was very quick to\
      \ code up to a working (if not polished or pretty) state. It's called the Death\
      \ Spell, which is probably a bad name, and when triggered it drains a substantial\
      \ amount of Mana and sets off something very like a Redeemer explosion. At the\
      \ same time it spawns a Redeemer explosion effect. It does this at the player's\
      \ location, so obviously they die - but so does everyone nearby, and so when\
      \ triggered at just the right time it can actually increase your score. Not\
      \ much good outside of individual Deathmatch I guess, although there are a few\
      \ occasions it might be handy in CTF or BR games - mostly to do with delaying\
      \ the opposing team members from chasing your ball/flag carrier, then when your\
      \ mate's far enough away, blowing yourself (and them) to smithereens. Secondary\
      \ fire on that is the new improved float-into-the-air spell which now accelerates\
      \ you gradually upwards over time, and I think I'll keep it like that for now.</p>\n\

      external text\" href=\"http://gamestudies.cdis.org/~jgiles/\">Sega 500 Unreal\
      \ Scripting</a>, I now have a new weapon which fires fireballs and consumes\
      \ mana to do it. I then couldn't be bothered to code up another weapon, so I\
      \ changed the secondary fire from precisely identical fireballs to the lift-into-the-air\
      \ spell, which has a few glitches that need working out. For example, at the\
      \ moment if you float up and hit the ceiling, then move out from under it while\
      \ still floating, you don't go up anymore because the spell doesn't notice that\
      \ it should reset the velocity again. I see two options for this:</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>set the velocity based on timer events</li>\n<li>check on timer events if\
      \ the velocity should be set, and if so set it (i.e. do collision tests)</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>I'm not sure which will be best, and shall have to try it. One thing\
      \ is certain - the bots won't have a clue what to do with this one!</p>\n<p>I\
      \ now need to make a general base class for all the spells like lift and heal\
