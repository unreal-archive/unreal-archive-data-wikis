      \ and add the light to illuminate the scene. Go back to the Generic Browser\
      \ <i>(don't forget to move back to the Generic tab at the top)</i>, and under\
      \ the file menu, open, and provided you installed to the default place, you\
      \ will find UN-Sky under the following directory tree, C:/Program Files/Unreal\
      \ Tournament 3/UT Game/CookedPC/Environments, open it, and then look for it\
      \ in the list at the bottom left of the Generic Browser, click it, search for\

      \ it down, so that from roughly eye level you can't see the black, the black\
      \ area causes a wierd feedback when it is visible, it looks horrible, but we\
      \ are only testing this mesh, not building a level, and this should suffice\
