      \ The only thing is, for some commands you need binary read/write methods because\
      \ the NULL char is used in some occasions.</p>\n<p>Well no real problem, just\
      \ switch to Binary mode for the negotiation. But binary support is limited to\
      \ manual reading because the events are broken. Manual reading doesn't work\

      \ poll if there's data because the Data pending methods/vars are broken too.</p>\n\

      <p><i><b>19-01-2003</b></i> well binary events are fixed in UT2003 version 2175\

      <p>Bugs are a pain in the ass. But things that works ok on one system, but totaly\
      \ works wrong on a other system are just ridiculous. UTelAdSE works perfectly\
      \ on my test system, but a friend reported that local echo was not disabled\
      \ on his client when he uses UTelAdSE on his server. The weird thing is, the\
      \ client works correctly. After the login prompt is received by the client nothing\
      \ should happen. But on his system telnet control negotiation happens after\
      \ the prompt enabling local echo. This is just plain stupid because UTelAdSE\
      \ doesn't send any control sequences to the client at that point.</p>\n<p>Bug\

      <p><i><b>26-01-2003</b></i> UnrealIRCD is a subclass of the UTelAdSE system,\
      \ instead of followng the telnet standard it will talk IRC. This will add some\
      \ limitations since the client side does all the output rendering, for example\
      \ the hangman game would not be possible. But this would also introduce some\
      \ usefull features for the clients connecting to it, like a channal for the\
      \ chatting and real time player management (kicking/banning/chatting), auto\
      \ reconnect (by the irc client), etc...</p>\n<p>It should be quite easy to extend\
      \ the current system to talk a diffirent TCP protocol, some changes have to\
      \ be made in the connection accepting class tho, but that would be it.</p>\n\
      <p>UnrealIRCD would be a straight forward IRC server with ofcourse not all IRC\
      \ feature implemented, just the one's realy needed by the server. But a possibility\
      \ for the future would be an actual relay chat server (with netsplits on every\
      \ map change&#160;;))</p>\n<p><i><b>27-01-2003</b></i> pff, implementing an\
      \ IRCd is a real pain, the IRC RFC is written from the client perspective. But\
      \ with the RFC and packet sniffing I've come a long way. Ok the current set\
      \ up is: two windows, one for chatting and one for the actual administrating.\
      \ The admin commands have to be send via messages because it's easier to use,\
      \ otherwise people need to /quote all the commands. The chat window would be\
      \ pretty nice because using /whois you could retreive the user info like: host\
      \ (duh), player ID, CD Key Hash, etc.. Also the /kick command should.</p>\n\
      <p>Admins will get a @ prefix (duh), real player will get a voice, and bots\
      \ won't get anything (because they don't realy have a voice). The WebAdmin sepectator\
      \ (and UTelAdSE, BullShit, etc...) will also show up in the list.</p>\n<p>There\
      \ are however a couple of normal IRC commands/features that should not work:\
      \ JOIN, PART, BAN (could be possible tho), private messaging, channel mode changes,\
      \ user mode changes, notices, ...</p>\n<p><i><b>28-01-2003</b></i> changed the\
      \ name to TitanIRCd which is short for Trivial Interactive Text Administration\
      \ Network . Heh.. ok it's just a name. Also found the IRCd RFC (IRC server RFC)\

      <p><i><b>28-01-2003</b></i> development is going pretty well, but now I walked\
      \ into a wall, sort of. I need to keep track of all users in a general place,\
      \ I only get join messages of real players not all sorts of other players. So\
      \ I need to keep track when a unknown person speaks it should join the server.\
      \ But I also also add his info record in a general place, this means I also\
      \ need to keep track of the IRC clients to forward the join messages. But anyway,\
      \ I have had an actualy IRC conversation on the server today&#160;:)</p>\n<p><i><b>31-01-2003</b></i>\
      \ well development is coming a long very well, I've almost implemented all functionality.\
      \ The admin channel works like it should (I think). Player joins/parts are reported.\
      \ Only name changes of players are not reported, looks like I don't receive\
      \ that gamemessage. There are just a few things I have to implement for the\
      \ first beta release. Maybe tomorrow.</p>\n<p><i><b>10-3-2003</b></i> No this\
      \ one isn't dead yet, just not so active. Added a couple of function to replace\
      \ the usage of tabs, tabs a evil since they tend to screw up a lot. Also tabs\

      \ AST.</p>\n<p>This could be a solution:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi\
      \ mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"\
      de1\"><span class=\"kw1\">struct</span> Node\n<span class=\"br0\">{</span>\n\

      \ filter out the useless tokens and convert identifiers to keywords.</p>\n<p>oi\
      \ nutter, changing infix to prefix notation is difficult when you are using\

      \ a while.</p>\n<p><i><b>18-4-2003</b></i> finished the AST and implemented\
      \ an interpreter. The AST is not complete since the function declarations are\
      \ not passed on, I need to think of a good way to do this since I want to be\
      \ able to store the functions, I don't want them executed everything the main\
      \ code is executed. Also the interpreter is not complete, the operators only\
      \ work for INT types at the moment and the type conversion isn't implemented\
      \ yet. But for the rest it works like a charm. I've also added a print(), argc()\
      \ and argv() function. To implement the function calls I had to make my grammar\
      \ LL(2)&#160;:( There's no other way to do that except for a special token for\
      \ a function call, and that simply sucks.</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi\

      \ converted the timestamp function from <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wutils?redlink=1\"\

      \ my current specification is complete.</p>\n<p>Yes... working function calls,\
      \ the solution was quite easy all I had to do is add a new declaration type\
      \ Function and jump to the tree node where the function code is. The input variables\
      \ can just be read from the refering node. Also added AND, OR and MOD operators.</p>\n\
      <p><i><b>22-4-2003</b></i> Help, it's slow&#160;;) Takes about 2 seconds to\

  wikitext:
    text: "==UTelAdSE ==\n\n===ConsoleCommand issues ===\n\nConsole commands are great,\
      \ but why does it work how it works. I want to get server access to a console\
      \ as powerfull as the players console (ExtendedConsole), but requires to use\
      \ Interactions.\n\nThe only accessable consolecommands (Level.ConsoleCommand\
      \ and PlayerController.ConsoleCommand) only have some basic working commands,\
      \ and no feedback if a consolecommand exists.\n\nHow can I use interactions\
      \ on a server, I don't have a viewport (Player instance) and spawning a PlayerController\
      \ doesn't give me a viewport. \n\nTrying to create ExtendedConsole and InteractionMaster\
      \ instances on a custom PlayerController resulted in a server crash when I called\
      \ ConsoleCommand. I nullified all code in my new interaction classes, and still\
      \ I get an error.\n\nIs there an other way to call console commands ?\n\n'''Dma:'''\
      \ All [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]] and [[Legacy:Interaction|Interaction]] subclasses\
      \ have consolecommand.  However, the [[Legacy:Interaction|Interaction]] one\
      \ returns a bool instead of a string.  There are other differences as well.\
      \  The console command is executed in the context of the actor, but this rarely\
      \ makes a difference.\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' Well the ConsoleCommand method\
      \ in [[Legacy:Interaction|Interaction]] has more power then the one in [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]]\
      \ (as I said above). I want a white-box ConsoleCommand.\n\n===Edit gametype\
      \ settings ===\n\nHow can I implement this best ? The WebAdmin and xAdmin use\
      \ Game PlayInfo classes. Using PlayInfo is the best solution because this would\
      \ allow you to set mutator settings as well (when they are loaded) (available\
      \ in the nest UT2003 version (2136+)). I think it's best to implement it sort\
      \ of the same way as the MapList editor, to use an option flag `-gametype` to\
      \ set a value for the specific game type. Changes should be saved when submitted\
      \ in order to support more admins at the same time.\n\n{{innerbox| /gametype\
      \ <list> | <set> [-gametype] setting value | <get> [-gametype] [mask]\n\n <list>\
      \ display list of available gametypes\n\n <set> set a setting to value\n\n <get>\
      \ get available settings, matching mask\n\n}}\n\n===Default properties and config\
      \ ===\n\nI came to an intresting discoverry when I released the first version\
      \ of UTelAdSE. \n\nYou can use the [[Legacy:Default Properties|default properties]]\
      \ to define the default value of a configurable variable. When this option is\
      \ not configured it will use the default variable. This doesn't work the same\
      \ way with dynamic arrays, instead dynamic arrays will sometimes be initialised\
      \ als null.\n\nLet say you have the following:\n\n<uscript>\nvar config string\
      \ astring;\nvar config array<string> stringlist;\n\ndefaulproperties\n{\n  astring=\"\
      not empty\"\n  stringlist(0)=\"zero\"\n  stringlist(1)=\"one\"\n  stringlist(2)=\"\
      two\"\n}\n</uscript>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:\
      \ center\" |'''''ini configuration'''''\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |'''''initial\
      \ values'''''\n| style=\"text-align: center\" |'''''notes''''' \n|-\n|empty\n\
      |astring=\"not empty\" <br />                        stringlist(0)=\"zero\"\
      \ <br />                        stringlist(1)=\"one\" <br />               \
      \         stringlist(2)=\"two\"\n|\n|-\n|astring=\"new value\" <br />  stringlist=\"\
      0\" <br />  stringlist=\"1\" <br />  stringlist=\"2\"\n|<br />  astring=\"new\
      \ value\" <br />  stringlist(0)=\"0\" <br />  stringlist(1)=\"1\" <br />  stringlist(2)=\"\
      2\"\n|\n|-\n|astring=\"something\"\n|astring=\"something\" <br />          \
      \              '''stringlist(0)=null''' <br />                        '''stringlist(1)=null'''\
      \ <br />                        '''stringlist(2)=null'''\n|<br />As you can\
      \ see when you don't define the value of a dynamic array, but do configure an\
      \ other variable the dynamic array will be initialised as null\n|-\n|&nbsp;\
      \ <br />  stringlist=\"new\" <br />  stringlist=\"newer\"\n|<br />  astring=\"\
      not empty\" <br />  stringlist(0)=\"new\" <br />  stringlist(1)=\"newer\" <br\
      \ />  '''stringlist(2)=null'''\n|\n|}\n\n===Telnet Protocol ===\n\nTelnet is\
      \ very simple, it's just 7bit ASCII and nothing more. But there's a litte bit\
      \ more, Telnet Commands, these can be used for special actions like turning\
      \ on/off local echo, or retreive the terminal size. The only thing is, for some\
      \ commands you need binary read/write methods because the NULL char is used\
      \ in some occasions.\n\nWell no real problem, just switch to Binary mode for\
      \ the negotiation. But binary support is limited to manual reading because the\
      \ events are broken. Manual reading doesn't work very well since you never know\
      \ if there's something to read, you can't just poll if there's data because\
      \ the Data pending methods/vars are broken too.\n\nI've now made a terrible\
      \ method for doing this using some loops and stuff.\n\n'''''19-01-2003'''''\
      \ well binary events are fixed in UT2003 version 2175 and up, so now I'm able\
      \ to improve the code. Ofcourse I need to keep backward compatibility with older\
      \ versions so the old code is still there and used when the version is below\
      \ 2175.\n\n===Bugs ===\n\nBugs are a pain in the ass. But things that works\
      \ ok on one system, but totaly works wrong on a other system are just ridiculous.\
      \ UTelAdSE works perfectly on my test system, but a friend reported that local\
      \ echo was not disabled on his client when he uses UTelAdSE on his server. The\
      \ weird thing is, the client works correctly. After the login prompt is received\
      \ by the client nothing should happen. But on his system telnet control negotiation\
      \ happens after the prompt enabling local echo. This is just plain stupid because\
      \ UTelAdSE doesn't send any control sequences to the client at that point.\n\
      \nBug was solved with v101, but I didn't do anything diffirent afaik. \n\n===Documentation\
      \ ===\n\nGood documentation is required, even if people don't read it. Writing\
      \ documentation is just plain boring. Also formatting the documentation correctly\
      \ so it will be usefull and clear. Usualy this isn't realy a problem since most\
      \ text is straight forward. But what to do when you have to document a lot of\
      \ pretty advanced builtin commands.\n\nFor example you have a command that can\
      \ do the following:\n  /maplist list\n  /maplist add CTF-Map.ut2 ...\n  /maplist\
      \ del CTF-Othermap.ut2\n  /maplist move 1 2\n  /maplist view\n  /maplist -gametype\
      \ BR list\n  ...\n\nFirst I have to give the full commandline possible, so something\
      \ like:\n  /maplist [-gametype type] &lt;list|view|move x y|add maps ...|del\
      \ maps ...>\n\nThen I have to explain the stuff. And that for a lot of commands.\
      \ It's better that somebody else writes documentation :)\n\n===ladder/profile\
      \ editing ===\n\nObjective: keep a list of predefined game settings\n\nNeed\
      \ to ask Evolution about this.\n\nEvo's Ladder is a shit load of non linear\
      \ code (just like UT2003), damn it takes a lot of time to go through it, I bet\
      \ people get the same idea when they check out the UTelAdSE code.\n\nThanks\
      \ to the additional WebQueryHandler Evo provided with Ladder coding the UTelAdSE\
      \ plugin for this is pretty easy, this way I don't have to find out everything\
      \ myself. But still it's a lot of work. I'm no stuck at the Profile editing\
      \ and Profile management, it's a lot of pretty \"dumb\" work, most of the time\
      \ it's just copy paste and adjust. I prefer inventing stuff.\n\n===Coding block\
      \ ===\n\n'''''19-01-2003''''' it sucks, plain as that. There are quite some\
      \ TODO points left (Evo's Ladder), but I just don't feel like implementing it.\
      \ Simply because it's not a real challange. I don't realy have to come up with\
      \ new things, all I have to do is somewhat copy part of the gametype editing\
      \ code and use it with the ladders. You can't realy force yourself to start\
      \ working, so in result you just don't do shit. Besides I also have to do other\
      \ stuff (yeah right).\n\n===TitanIRCd ===\n\n'''''26-01-2003''''' UnrealIRCD\
      \ is a subclass of the UTelAdSE system, instead of followng the telnet standard\
      \ it will talk IRC. This will add some limitations since the client side does\
      \ all the output rendering, for example the hangman game would not be possible.\
      \ But this would also introduce some usefull features for the clients connecting\
      \ to it, like a channal for the chatting and real time player management (kicking/banning/chatting),\
      \ auto reconnect (by the irc client), etc...\n\nIt should be quite easy to extend\
      \ the current system to talk a diffirent TCP protocol, some changes have to\
      \ be made in the connection accepting class tho, but that would be it.\n\nUnrealIRCD\
      \ would be a straight forward IRC server with ofcourse not all IRC feature implemented,\
      \ just the one's realy needed by the server. But a possibility for the future\
      \ would be an actual relay chat server (with netsplits on every map change ;))\n\
      \n'''''27-01-2003''''' pff, implementing an IRCd is a real pain, the IRC RFC\
      \ is written from the client perspective. But with the RFC and packet sniffing\
      \ I've come a long way. Ok the current set up is: two windows, one for chatting\
      \ and one for the actual administrating. The admin commands have to be send\
      \ via messages because it's easier to use, otherwise people need to /quote all\
      \ the commands. The chat window would be pretty nice because using /whois you\
      \ could retreive the user info like: host (duh), player ID, CD Key Hash, etc..\
      \ Also the /kick command should.\n\nAdmins will get a @ prefix (duh), real player\
      \ will get a voice, and bots won't get anything (because they don't realy have\
      \ a voice). The WebAdmin sepectator (and UTelAdSE, BullShit, etc...) will also\
      \ show up in the list.\n\nThere are however a couple of normal IRC commands/features\
      \ that should not work: JOIN, PART, BAN (could be possible tho), private messaging,\
      \ channel mode changes, user mode changes, notices, ...\n\n'''''28-01-2003'''''\
      \ changed the name to TitanIRCd which is short for Trivial Interactive Text\
      \ Administration Network . Heh.. ok it's just a name. Also found the IRCd RFC\
      \ (IRC server RFC) http://rfc.sunsite.dk/rfc/rfc2813.html that would help me\
      \ on my journey.\n\n'''''28-01-2003''''' development is going pretty well, but\
      \ now I walked into a wall, sort of. I need to keep track of all users in a\
      \ general place, I only get join messages of real players not all sorts of other\
      \ players. So I need to keep track when a unknown person speaks it should join\
      \ the server. But I also also add his info record in a general place, this means\
      \ I also need to keep track of the IRC clients to forward the join messages.\
      \ But anyway, I have had an actualy IRC conversation on the server today :)\n\
      \n'''''31-01-2003''''' well development is coming a long very well, I've almost\
      \ implemented all functionality. The admin channel works like it should (I think).\
      \ Player joins/parts are reported. Only name changes of players are not reported,\
      \ looks like I don't receive that gamemessage. There are just a few things I\
      \ have to implement for the first beta release. Maybe tomorrow.\n\n'''''10-3-2003'''''\
      \ No this one isn't dead yet, just not so active. Added a couple of function\
      \ to replace the usage of tabs, tabs a evil since they tend to screw up a lot.\
      \ Also tabs don't work with most IRC clients. Thus I implemented AlignLeft\\\
      Right\\Center, soon to be added to [[Legacy:WUtils|WUtils]]\n\n----\n\n'''DJPaul:'''\
      \ Hope you don't mind greatly me writing here, but: UnrealIRCd is, indeed, an\
      \ actual IRCd.  The same name would confuse people.  See http://www.unrealircd.com/.\
      \  If i'm reading this right, WHY does UT need a IRCd?  If you just want IRC<->UT\
      \ talk, you can use http://serverdev.beyondunreal.com/.  Yes, you could handle\
      \ players/chat via IRC...\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I suppose to allow server administration\
      \ via IRC.  I could imagine that'd appeal to many people more than telnet administration\
      \ (though that's pretty neat too)...\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' oh damn, ok.. guess\
      \ I need a new name for it\n\n===TODO ===\n* ofcourse check for any security\
      \ issues\n* add ladder/profile editing\n* documentation\n\n==BruteForce ==\n\
      \nBruteForce is a small programming language written in UnrealScript. Don't\
      \ ask why, just because.\n\nThe source code and specifications are available\
      \ from my [[Legacy:CVS|CVS]], and accessable via\n\nhttp://el-muerte.student.utwente.nl/cgi-bin/cvsweb/UT2003/BruteForce/\n\
      \nThe language is case insensitive and type complete.\n\nThe ENBF specification\
      \ is not complete.\n\nI may need to switch to actually seperate compiling and\
      \ executing. Otherwise it's notpossible to do a while loop without very ugly\
      \ statements, even worse that my if-then-else solution.\n\nNote: BruteForce\
      \ has a very usefull [[Legacy:Tokenizer|Tokenizer]], you may want to take a\
      \ look at it when you need to do parsing of text.\n\n'''''16-4-2003''''' rewrote\
      \ my previous grammar, and started on a new compiler to create an AST so I can\
      \ actually execute the code after compiling it. On the fly execution just doesn't\
      \ work.\n\n'''''17-4-2003''''' add support for function declarations, I think\
      \ I now have all the functionality I want in the grammar (except for some builtin\
      \ functions, but those don't matter much). I really should start to figure out\
      \ how I can implement the AST.\n\nThis could be a solution:\n\n<uscript>\nstruct\
      \ Node\n{\n  var tokenType  token;\n  var string     value;\n  var array<int>\
      \ children;\n}\narray<Node> Tree;\n</uscript>\n\nOfcourse I need to filter out\
      \ the useless tokens and convert identifiers to keywords.\n\noi nutter, changing\
      \ infix to prefix notation is difficult when you are using a recursive decended\
      \ parser. I need to switch tree nodes around or something, but I also have to\
      \ track the depth... Argh, need to get my mind of this for a while.\n\n'''''18-4-2003'''''\
      \ finished the AST and implemented an interpreter. The AST is not complete since\
      \ the function declarations are not passed on, I need to think of a good way\
      \ to do this since I want to be able to store the functions, I don't want them\
      \ executed everything the main code is executed. Also the interpreter is not\
      \ complete, the operators only work for INT types at the moment and the type\
      \ conversion isn't implemented yet. But for the rest it works like a charm.\
      \ I've also added a print(), argc() and argv() function. To implement the function\
      \ calls I had to make my grammar LL(2) :( There's no other way to do that except\
      \ for a special token for a function call, and that simply sucks.\n\n<uscript>\n\
      a = doSomething(a);      // nice\na = call doSomething(a); // ugly\n</uscript>\n\
      \n'''''21-4-2003''''' fixed the type completeness, there are only some wierd\
      \ things, like wtf does \"string\"-\"string\" do !? So I left that ''blank''.\
      \ Also fixed the execution order, 1-2+3 would be executed as 1-(2+3). To test\
      \ everything I converted the timestamp function from [[Legacy:Wutils|wutils]]\
      \ to BruteForce and it works , woohoo... Now to add support of functions and\
      \ then my current specification is complete.\n\nYes... working function calls,\
      \ the solution was quite easy all I had to do is add a new declaration type\
      \ Function and jump to the tree node where the function code is. The input variables\
      \ can just be read from the refering node. Also added AND, OR and MOD operators.\n\
      \n'''''22-4-2003''''' Help, it's slow ;) Takes about 2 seconds to calculate\
      \ 100 easter dates. And I think most of the time is used by the Scope class\
      \ to lookup declarations, not sure tho, there's no good way to calculate the\
      \ time used by the Scope, or is there ?\n\nAnyway, current state is pretty usefull.\
      \ Maybe I need to add output variables to the main program block."
