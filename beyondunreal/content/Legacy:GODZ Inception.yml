      legacyquote\">\n<p>Well, I guess I'll post my thoughts on how GODZ was started\
      \ in the hopes it will help someone looking for ideas on how to start a team,\
      \ recruit key talent, and implement their ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GODZ\
      \ was basically conceived by two guys, James 'Disector' Morris and myself, vajuras,\
      \ sometime around Spring 2001. We had knew each other because of our work on\
      \ FEBA, a partial conversion for UT.</p>\n<p>Our desire was to create a total\
      \ conversion for Unreal Tournament that would feature new fighters, enviroments,\
      \ etc. At thetime, Disector could skin, create music, and map. I pretty much\
      \ possessed the other talents he didn't have: coding, modeling, and animating.\
      \ The first thing I did was develop the initial concept. I wanted it to be very\
      \ short and simple (like the game title). So I came up with simple concept of\
      \ a universal wide tournament that features supernatural beings. At the time,\
      \ I was burned out on modeling/animating weapons so we decided GODZ wouldn't\
      \ use any weapons and it would feature 3rd person.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks\
      \ we organized a simple little site and got together a set of models. This was\
      \ the key to our strategy- we would first develop some early prototypes and\
      \ start showing them around to people. We wanted experienced artists/mappers\
      \ working on the mod, so we figured it would help to have some nice stuff to\
      \ show around. Back then, we wasn't sure if we could attract any mappers to\
      \ the mod so we kept things simple- the mod would focus on 1-on-1 matches. This\
      \ way, the maps could be small.</p>\n<p>Our first recruit was a mapper that\
      \ had worked with us previously on the FEBA team, Adam Stiles. Adam quickly\
      \ put together a nice map and from there we started hand picking the mappers\
      \ we wanted to join. I only invited mappers that had previously released content\
      \ to the mapping review sites and their work fit into our theme some what (the\
      \ maps were fantasy/sci-fi).</p>\n<p>I could tell we had a good concept because\
      \ the majority of the folks we invited joined immediately. If they couldn't\
      \ join, they replied saying that they thought the idea was good. Now, I am not\
      \ bragging but I think that is very important- basing a mod on a solid concept.\
      \ <i>A concept that can be explained in just a few lines</i>.</p>\n<p>After\
      \ a few months we launched the site on PU. The initial design wasn't all that\
      \ great but it was a start. However, the mod didn't seem to grasp people like\
      \ we thought it would. Our web site hits wasn't quite what I expected. Doing\
      \ the public relations stuff to pimp your mod can sometimes be the hardest part.\
      \ Especially if your mod doesn't 'fit' into a particular genre. The best way\
      \ I could think of to describe GODZ was to just compare it to DBZ. As expected,\
      \ this aroused a lot of attention in the mod. Then I redid the site design to\
      \ appeal to DBZ fans and we released a 'preview' movie.</p>\n<p>Our hits started\
      \ going up quite a bit then. It wasn't a volume of traffic as huge as tactical\
      \ ops but still it helped us feel like there was some folks out there that was\
      \ interested in the mod. I think that is one place where I went wrong- expecting\
      \ a huge volume of traffic. When a team directly bases their product on the\
      \ <b>Matrix</b> or <b>Dragonball</b> - you inherit their fan base. However,\
      \ if you create something brand new, you don't always have the base created\
      \ for you. So it took some advertising and a lot of pimping to get folks out\
      \ there to recognize what the mod was.</p>\n<p>Another struggle we had was that\
      \ I wanted to get some C++ coding experience. So I created a native dll that\
      \ would play mp3/ogg music. The downside was that the dll would not work on\
      \ linux/mac users. I naviely thought perhaps those other systems were just a\
      \ small part of the unreal community. Boy was I wrong!</p>\n<p>Our first release\
      \ was carefully coordinated with gamespy so that we could get the best pimpage\
      \ possible. The first version was d/l over 10,000 or so just from fileplanet\
      \ within the first day. Not bad for a Windows only mod. Unfortunately, mac/linux\
      \ users were left out. And boy- did they make their discouragement felt.</p>\n\
      <p>After a few days the first mod review was published. The first release had\
      \ gotten like a 6.0 or something. Now, we were wasn't happy with the score but\
      \ that was not the problem. <b>The reviewer only played 1 level out of the 16\
      \ that was included and just reviewed the mod based on that.</b> We could tell\
      \ because the only picture he posted was the worst level we included (plus he\
      \ made 2-3 incorrect statements). One of our mappers basically made a crappy\
      \ level but we included it anyway because that was our policy- to include everyone's\
      \ work. Of course now I know much better&#160;:)</p>\n<p>In any case, we contacted\
      \ the site and they updated their score to 8.0. Then modsquad reviewed the mod\
      \ and gave us a 9.6 or something high like that. Kewl.</p>\n<p>After that our\
      \ forums started really jumping with activity and our servers pretty much stayed\
      \ busy during peak hours. Inspite of all that, I pretty much have always kept\
      \ a modest view about the mod. It suprises me when I meet people that play our\
      \ mod, etc. Since the release we have been invited to a lot of nice events such\
      \ as the Westwood College (met Infiltration, UnF, and some other teams there)\
      \ and the Epic mod event. Every time I'm like - \"How did they find out about\
      \ GODZ???\"</p>\n<p>Since that time we've lost a lot of good talent and others\
      \ have joined. We once thought we would only get 1 mapper and maybe only release\
      \ with 3-4 maps. The first release contained over 11 maps and the team grew\
      \ so big we started turning away a lot of talent.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this is how\
      \ our mod started. It's been a fun ride ever since.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit\
