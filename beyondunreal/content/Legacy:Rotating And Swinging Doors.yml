      \ title=\"Legacy:Mover\">mover</a> in the opening or entrance to another room.</p>\n\
      <p>The mover needs the properties listed below:</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>Object\
      \ -&gt; <a href=\"/Legacy:InitialState\" title=\"Legacy:InitialState\">InitialState</a></td>\n\

      \ pivot is at this location of the brush.</p>\n<p>To create the door brush I\
      \ first create the door somewhere in open space. Then I create a twice as large\

      \ 'new' pivot to be.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the 'new' center handle will be\
      \ placed on the top right corner of the door. Then intersect the brush and you\
      \ have a mover that can be made to work as a realistic door.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place\
      \ the door in the opening and then change to keyframe 1.</li>\n<li>Rotate the\

      \ to make a door swing either way depending on what direction the player come\
      \ from.</p>\n<p>Simply because a mover move from one keyframe to another in\
      \ sequence which makes skipping frames impossible.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>I'm sure I've\
