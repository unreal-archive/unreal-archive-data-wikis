      \ Aren't there enough Unreal Editing sites already?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Yes! But\
      \ this site is not \"just another tute site.\" This site began with the aim\
      \ to consolidate a fractured knowledge base: It's now two years since Unreal\
      \ Tournament has been released, and editing info is still hard to find on the\
      \ web. I think we can change that.<br />\nI also think that when the next generation\
      \ of Unreal games is released it would be better for the mapping community if\
      \ everyone's titbits of information about the new engine were grouped together,\
      \ instead of scattered around. – <a href=\"/Legacy:Tarquin\" title=\"Legacy:Tarquin\"\
      >Tarquin</a></dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Why are so many pages unfinished?&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Articles don't have a single author. If a page seems unfinished to you,\
      \ add to it. – <a href=\"/Legacy:Tarquin\" title=\"Legacy:Tarquin\">Tarquin</a></dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>How do I search the site?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>There is a search\
      \ box at the top and bottom of every page on this site. Just enter some terms\
      \ (separated by blanks) and hit Enter. The Wiki will show you the pages that\
      \ match your query best. (Enclose terms that contain blanks of their own in\
      \ double quotes.)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>How does it work?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This\
      \ is a completely open project. Everybody &amp; anybody can contribute. You\
      \ are an editor: you can edit any page by clicking the link at the bottom and\
      \ you can add new pages. You have as much say the content of the site as I do.<br\
      \ />\nThe site grows quickly because anyone can add or change material straight\
      \ away. To get started, see <a href=\"/Legacy:New_Contributors_Quick_Start\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:New Contributors Quick Start\">New Contributors Quick Start</a>.\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_Markup\" title=\"Legacy:Wiki Markup\">Wiki markup</a>\
      \ is very simple to learn. Go and see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\"\
      \ href=\"http://www.wikipedia.com/\">Wikipedia</a> for an idea of what can be\
      \ accomplished with the Wiki system. – <a href=\"/Legacy:Tarquin\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Tarquin\">Tarquin</a></dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>What are all the&#160;?\
      \ links?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Those are links that people have made to pages that\
      \ don't yet exist on the system. When you type text [[Legacy:Like This|like\
      \ this]] in a page, Wiki creates a link. If the text in the double square brackets\
      \ isn't the name of an existing page, the new link will lead to a form where\
      \ the new page can be created. Once the page has been created, the text will\
      \ become normal link. See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_FAQ\" title=\"Legacy:Wiki\
      \ FAQ\">Wiki FAQ</a> – Tarquin</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Anyone can edit my text?\
      \ Ewwww!&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Weird, isn't it? The first article I submitted to Wikipedia\
      \ was edited within a day or so, and even though I knew it would happen, it\
      \ was very strange seeing pieces of my text embedded in somebody else's. you\
      \ get used to it. Changes or additions to the wiki become part of a whole that\
      \ is bigger than any single writer. – Tarquin</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Isn't it\
      \ all going to turn into one big <i>horrible</i> mess?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Probably.\
      \ But it's fairly easy to re-organize pages or move material from one to another.<br\
      \ />\nFor example, at the time of writing (only two days into the project) we\
      \ have pages called \"Brush\" and \"Brushes\". We also seem to be tending towards\
      \ encyclopaedia-style article headers, rather than titles like \"how to apply\
      \ lighting\". Neither of these things is a problem. It's also fine to have articles\
      \ that don't belong in a strict hierarchy. We can organize material later –\
      \ if you see a link which you think would be better off in a different place,\
      \ you can move it. – Tarquin</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>I'm not l33t enough to contribute.&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Anyone can help. If you've ever opened UnrealEd, you're bound to know something.\
      \ If you've only opened it once, you have the beginner's perspective – if the\
      \ articles aimed at beginners don't make sense to you, <i>change</i> them so\
      \ they do! – <a href=\"/Legacy:Tarquin\" title=\"Legacy:Tarquin\">Tarquin</a></dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Would you like an article on (topic)? Could you add a link\
      \ to (site)?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>If you think it's relevant to the content of this\
      \ Wiki, then yes we probably do, but the real answer to the first question is:\
      \ it's up to you. The answer to the second question is: No. You can add it yourself.&#160;:D</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>What if idiots damage the site?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Other Wiki\
      \ sites say that this isn't a problem. And, actually, we have a full-time Idiot-Proofer\
      \ on Staff. Admittedly, gaming communities do seem to have their share of idiots.\
      \ The server keeps past versions of articles, so while anyone can damage the\
      \ site, anyone who spots damage can immediately fix it – look for the \"View\
      \ Other Revisions\" link. Editing and saving a past revision over-writes the\
      \ current version of a page.<br />\nAdmins keep zipped backups of the entire\
      \ site as an extra precaution. IPs are publicly logged on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Recent_Changes\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Recent Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Recent Changes</a> pages,\
      \ and if necessary they can be blocked. Admins can also lock the entire site,\
      \ making it read-only. – <a href=\"/Legacy:Tarquin\" title=\"Legacy:Tarquin\"\

      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Do I need to register?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>No. Registration is\
      \ optional. All it will do is show your user name on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Recent_Changes\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Recent Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Recent Changes</a> list\
      \ instead of your IP, and save your preferences for viewing the site. Click\
      \ on <i>preferences</i> and enter a name and password to register.<br />\nYou're\
      \ also invited to create a <a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Personal_Page\" title=\"\
      Category:Legacy Personal Page\">personal page</a> for yourself. If you like,\
      \ you can make your name in the list a wiki link and create a page for your\
