      \ and as such are much larger than maps for the other gametypes. The smallest\
      \ Onslaught map is probably around the same size as the largest Capture the\
      \ Flag or Bombing Run map. The gametype supports these large maps in the following\
      \ ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Combat is concentrated around around Power Nodes. In\
      \ general only one or two Power Nodes will be attackable at any one time.</li>\n\
      <li>Players can teleport between Power Nodes their team controls and their base\
      \ as long as the Power Node is not under attack. This allows rapid travel across\
      \ the map.</li>\n<li>Players can spawn at any Power Node their team controls\
      \ as long as it is not under attack. This allows a <i>moving front</i> to be\
      \ developed.</li>\n<li>Vehicles allow players to cover ground much faster than\
      \ they can on foot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the size of the map, ensuring the\
      \ map is optimised well and has a good framerate thoughout becomes much more\
      \ important.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_of_the_Z-Axis\">Use\

      <p>Making effective use of the <a href=\"/Legacy:Z-Axis\" title=\"Legacy:Z-Axis\"\
      >Z-Axis</a> within Onslaught maps is very difficult. The map showing the Power\
      \ Node locations is a purely 2D construction and provides no clues as to the\
      \ height of a Power Node. Having to work in an additional axis will generally\
      \ mean that the map is not as instantly accessable as it otherwise might have\
      \ been.</p>\n<p>Slopes, hills, and mountains are all good things to have in\
      \ your map. Not only do they help provide the map with some crucial variation,\
      \ but they can also aid map optimisation.</p>\n<p>Avoid excessive use of <i>thin\
      \ paths across instant death precipices</i>. These can make vehicles almost\
      \ useless in sections of your map. Also some vehicles don't handle that well\
      \ close to an <i>edge</i>.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Power_Node_placement\"\
      >Power Node placement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_ONS?section=4\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Power Node placement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>The location of the Power Nodes on the map is one of the crucial factors\
      \ to how fast or slow your map will play. Maps that are sparsely populated with\
      \ Power Nodes will feel much larger than they perhaps are in reality, and the\
      \ pace of the game will be reduced as a consequence.</p>\n<p>Remember, the farther\
      \ apart the Power Nodes are from each other the longer it will take players\
      \ to travel between them. Spare a thought for the foot solider. A player who\
      \ finds himself spawning at a Power Node or Power Core with no available vehicles\
      \ has two choices. Wait for a vehicle to spawn or start running. Ideally the\
      \ jog to the next Power Node shouldn't be too long. ONS-Torlan has the Power\
      \ Node distances about right whereas the foot solider on ONS-Dria is in for\
      \ a long and dull walk.</p>\n<p>Each Power Node should have its own set of player\
      \ spawn points. These spawn points should be spread evenly around the node.\
      \ Place them such that newly spawning players can easily get to either a vehicle\
      \ or a weapon locker (preferably both).</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Avenues of attack\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It is very easy to make a Power Node extremely difficult\
      \ to hold once it is controlled. The hovering energy sphere that each Power\
      \ Node has can be used as a target from a significant distance. Use slopes,\
      \ trees, and other features to restrict the angles and distance from which the\
      \ Power Node's energy sphere can be attacked.</p>\n<p>It's also worth considering\
      \ adding shortcuts for players on foot that are not available to players in\
      \ vehicles to add additional tactical considerations to the map – or simply\
      \ to reudce the amount of time spent running to a Power Node.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Link setup\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>To design the various Link Setups for the map, play\
      \ the map and in-game, hit ESC to bring up the menu. Then click on Link Designer.\
      \ The nodes and cores that have been placed should be seen on the map and a\
      \ link setup can be made and saved.</p>\n<p>The way in which the Power Nodes\
      \ are linked together can radically alter the gameplay of the map. This happens\
      \ for two reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The path that must be followed to traverse\
      \ the map (link one base to the other) is determined by the link setup.</li>\n\
      <li>The vehicles and weapons available to teams is based upon the nodes captured.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>An example of this is linking the <i>tank node</i> on ONS-Torlan with\
      \ a teams base rather than the primary Power Node. This has the effect of allowing\
      \ a 2 front attack on the primary node making it significantly harder to control.\
      \ It also means a tank is always available to both teams.</p>\n<p>Typically\
      \ only one or two Power Nodes will link directly to a Power Core although the\
      \ actual number is really determined by the map design. Having many links to\
      \ the Power Core can dilute the pace of the game though so be careful when doing\
      \ it.</p>\n<p>Try and avoid having a single node in the center of the map acting\
      \ as a choke point linked to from more than two nodes unless there is a significant\
      \ chance that the node can be held long enough for one of the teams to advance.\
      \ ONS-Primeval is a good example of this. Without the tank at the central node\
      \ it would be impossible to hold it long enough to mount any sort of attack\
      \ on either the next node or the Power Core.</p>\n<p>Consider creating link\
      \ setups that allow a team to isolate an enemy power node. ONS-Dawn is a good\
      \ example of this. If one team is building the power node on one side of their\
      \ enemies base the other team can work their way down the other side of the\
      \ map and then cut across in the center of the map. By holding the two central\
      \ nodes they have isolated a node and are in a good position to mount an attack\
      \ themselves. Having these sorts of outflanking manoeuvers available to teams\
      \ can add significant depth and replayability to a map.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ release of UT2004:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raptors are excellent against land and air\
      \ targets but in a sky full of Avrils they won't last too long. They can be\
      \ a very quick way of getting from A to B as they are not tied to the terrain\
      \ unlike the rest of the vehicles.</li>\n<li>Tanks are powerful and slow moving.\
      \ Use their lack of speed to offset their devastating firepower. The vertical\
      \ angle at which the primary tank gun can aim is restricted so Tanks can be\
      \ disadvantaged when travelling on slopes.</li>\n<li>Hellbenders are a good\
      \ way of moving a bunch of people around quickly, and are excellent at destroying\
      \ infantry. Put them up against a tank and they won't last too long.</li>\n\
      <li>Scorpions are reasonably fast and can be an inconvenience to soldiers on\
      \ foot. They are good for taking out Power Nodes and Mantas. A fully charged\
      \ <i>bola</i> does a suprising amount of damage.</li>\n<li>Mantas are a very\
      \ fast way of getting around, but get killed easily. They are excellent against\
      \ Tanks without Avril support. The Manta's primary fire is an excellent way\
      \ of taking out Power Nodes from a long distance. They are also good for squishing\
      \ players on foot.</li>\n<li>Leviathans are very big, very powerful, and very\
      \ slow. A fully manned Leviathan is quite fearsome - when it eventually arrives.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>Additionally, there are ECE (Editor's Choice Edition) vehicles. These\
      \ vehicles are considered stock by the community and so you should not ignore\
      \ them. Most new maps these days include ECE vehicles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cicadas\
      \ are the most powerful weapon for taking down a node, and are not nearly as\
      \ good at other things. They can take down tanks and Levis faster than any other\
      \ vehicle, when used by expert pilots, but it is more risky than using a Raptor\
      \ to do so if the enemy team has Raptors of their own in the sky protecting\
      \ their tanks and Levis. Raptors can easily take down Cicadas. Almost all pilots\
      \ have a very tough time killing ground troops with Cicadas (because it is HARD\
      \ especially with higher pings).</li>\n<li>SPMAs are great for shelling contested\
      \ nodes near the center. They are sometimes placed in such a way as to defend\
      \ the enemy's primary node once it has been captured, which is an acceptable\
      \ use of them. But you should avoid placing them in such a way as to suggest\
      \ their use in spawn killing the losing team at their power core. That is not\
      \ fun for the losing team and players will hate your map.</li>\n<li>Paladins\
      \ are for defense. Defense! Got it? They are for shielding nodes and killing\
      \ nearby attackers. They are NOT for cross country rides to grandmother's house.</li>\n\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_ONS?section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Vehicle\
      \ Placement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>The golden rule here is balance. Your vehicle placement is the PRIMARY way\
      \ in which you can directly affect how much power the winning team has against\
      \ the losing team. Generally each Power Node will have between 2 and 4 vehicles\
      \ associated with it. The larger the map the more vehicles will be needed as\
      \ travelling between Power Nodes on foot becomes less attractive and less effective.</p>\n\
      <p>For making maps that really shine in gameplay, and support the kinds of strategies\
      \ and tactics experienced ONS players would like to use, follow these tips:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Try to limit the placements of tanks. Prefer to place them in the\
      \ base AND/OR at a central contested node. Avoid placing tanks at other nodes\
      \ as this generally gives the winning team too much of advantage over the losing\
      \ team.</li>\n<li>A similar reasoning applies to Leviathans. They are best placed\
      \ at each power core OR at a single central contested node (but not both). Giving\
      \ the winning team more than one Leviathan is a BAD idea.</li>\n<li>Paladins\
      \ are slow and vulnerable critters. But they make excellent defense vehicles\
      \ for nodes. Not only can they sheild the node, but they can even kill ground\
      \ troops that get close by using the Paladin combo (while sheild is up, press\
      \ fire to make a local shockwave for personal defense). Place Paladins ONLY\
      \ at or near primary or secondary nodes. Do not place them at a node that is\
      \ far away from the nodes they would be useful to defend. Avoid placing them\
      \ at the power core, unless it is a short drive to the primary node.</li>\n\
      <li>Avoid placing Mantas all over the map at various nodes. Giving the winning\
      \ team a hell of a lot of Mantas is a bad thing. It makes it nearly impossible\
      \ for the losing team to make a comeback when they are constantly being roadkilled,\
      \ and every time they get their primary node back up, 5 mantas attack it again.\
      \ Prefer to put 2 or 3 Mantas at each power core, and a sparse number at various\
      \ nodes throughout the map.</li>\n<li>Scorpians are great for taking out tanks,\
      \ as well as mantas in narrow channels. You may wish to place them with these\
      \ goals in mind to help the losing team fight back.</li>\n<li>The Raptor is\
      \ the most versitile vehicle of the lot. It can be used to take out enemy aircraft\
      \ (both Raptors and Cicadas), sniff out enemy snipers and campers hiding in\
      \ trees and rubble, kill tanks, Levis, Mantas, and so on. In fact, the best\
      \ use of the Raptor is as a predator of other vehicles (thus its name). There\
      \ really is no substitute for this. Cicadas are NOT good replacements for Raptors\
      \ (why? because enemy Raptors 'eat Cicadas for lunch.'). Do not think placing\
      \ a Cicada at the power core will be sufficient. You should always have at least\
      \ one Raptor there. This gives a losing team at least some chance of fighting\
      \ off the tanks and Levis that are slaughtering them, and makes the game more\
      \ interesting and comeback-possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Vehicle_Gameplay\"\

    text: "In '''Onslaught''' (ONS) two teams compete to build a chain of Power Nodes\
      \ from their Power Core to the other team's Power Core whereapon it can be attacked.\
      \  The game ends when one of the Power Cores has been destroyed.  The game restricts\
      \ the Power Nodes that can be attacked by linking them together in a specific\
      \ structure.  Onslaught also makes extensive use of vehicles.\n\n==Fundamentals==\n\
      \nTo create an onslaught map, the absolute minimum is to have two powercores,\
      \ spawn points for two players, and you must set the DefaultGameType in LevelInfo\
      \ to <tt>Onslaught.ONSOnslaughtGame</tt>.  Without these conditions the game\
      \ will not apply the necessary rules for the game to work.\n\n==Map size==\n\
      \nOnslaught maps are typically outdoor environments and as such are much larger\
      \ than maps for the other gametypes.  The smallest Onslaught map is probably\
      \ around the same size as the largest Capture the Flag or Bombing Run map. \
      \ The gametype supports these large maps in the following ways.\n* Combat is\
      \ concentrated around around Power Nodes.  In general only one or two Power\
      \ Nodes will be attackable at any one time.\n* Players can teleport between\
      \ Power Nodes their team controls and their base as long as the Power Node is\
      \ not under attack.  This allows rapid travel across the map.\n* Players can\
      \ spawn at any Power Node their team controls as long as it is not under attack.\
      \  This allows a ''moving front'' to be developed.\n* Vehicles allow players\
      \ to cover ground much faster than they can on foot.\n\nGiven the size of the\
      \ map, ensuring the map is optimised well and has a good framerate thoughout\
      \ becomes much more important.\n\n==Use of the Z-Axis==\n\nMaking effective\
      \ use of the [[Legacy:Z-Axis|Z-Axis]] within Onslaught maps is very difficult.\
      \  The map showing the Power Node locations is a purely 2D construction and\
      \ provides no clues as to the height of a Power Node.  Having to work in an\
      \ additional axis will generally mean that the map is not as instantly accessable\
      \ as it otherwise might have been.\n\nSlopes, hills, and mountains are all good\
      \ things to have in your map.  Not only do they help provide the map with some\
      \ crucial variation, but they can also aid map optimisation. \n\nAvoid excessive\
      \ use of ''thin paths across instant death precipices''.  These can make vehicles\
      \ almost useless in sections of your map.  Also some vehicles don't handle that\
      \ well close to an ''edge''.\n\n==Power Node placement==\n\nThe location of\
      \ the Power Nodes on the map is one of the crucial factors to how fast or slow\
      \ your map will play.  Maps that are sparsely populated with Power Nodes will\
      \ feel much larger than they perhaps are in reality, and the pace of the game\
      \ will be reduced as a consequence.\n\nRemember, the farther apart the Power\
      \ Nodes are from each other the longer it will take players to travel between\
      \ them.  Spare a thought for the foot solider.  A player who finds himself spawning\
      \ at a Power Node or Power Core with no available vehicles has two choices.\
      \  Wait for a vehicle to spawn or start running.  Ideally the jog to the next\
      \ Power Node shouldn't be too long.  ONS-Torlan has the Power Node distances\
      \ about right whereas the foot solider on ONS-Dria is in for a long and dull\
      \ walk.\n\nEach Power Node should have its own set of player spawn points. \
      \ These spawn points should be spread evenly around the node.  Place them such\
      \ that newly spawning players can easily get to either a vehicle or a weapon\
      \ locker (preferably both).\n\n===Avenues of attack===\n\nIt is very easy to\
      \ make a Power Node extremely difficult to hold once it is controlled.  The\
      \ hovering energy sphere that each Power Node has can be used as a target from\
      \ a significant distance.  Use slopes, trees, and other features to restrict\
      \ the angles and distance from which the Power Node's energy sphere can be attacked.\n\
      \nIt's also worth considering adding shortcuts for players on foot that are\
      \ not available to players in vehicles to add additional tactical considerations\
      \ to the map &ndash; or simply to reudce the amount of time spent running to\
      \ a Power Node.\n\n===Link setup===\n\nTo design the various Link Setups for\
      \ the map, play the map and in-game, hit ESC to bring up the menu.  Then click\
      \ on Link Designer.  The nodes and cores that have been placed should be seen\
      \ on the map and a link setup can be made and saved.\n\nThe way in which the\
      \ Power Nodes are linked together can radically alter the gameplay of the map.\
      \  This happens for two reasons.\n* The path that must be followed to traverse\
      \ the map (link one base to the other) is determined by the link setup.\n* The\
      \ vehicles and weapons available to teams is based upon the nodes captured.\n\
      \nAn example of this is linking the ''tank node'' on ONS-Torlan with a teams\
      \ base rather than the primary Power Node.  This has the effect of allowing\
      \ a 2 front attack on the primary node making it significantly harder to control.\
      \  It also means a tank is always available to both teams.\n\nTypically only\
      \ one or two Power Nodes will link directly to a Power Core although the actual\
      \ number is really determined by the map design.  Having many links to the Power\
      \ Core can dilute the pace of the game though so be careful when doing it.\n\
      \nTry and avoid having a single node in the center of the map acting as a choke\
      \ point linked to from more than two nodes unless there is a significant chance\
      \ that the node can be held long enough for one of the teams to advance.  ONS-Primeval\
      \ is a good example of this.  Without the tank at the central node it would\
      \ be impossible to hold it long enough to mount any sort of attack on either\
      \ the next node or the Power Core.\n\nConsider creating link setups that allow\
      \ a team to isolate an enemy power node.  ONS-Dawn is a good example of this.\
      \  If one team is building the power node on one side of their enemies base\
      \ the other team can work their way down the other side of the map and then\
      \ cut across in the center of the map.  By holding the two central nodes they\
      \ have isolated a node and are in a good position to mount an attack themselves.\
      \  Having these sorts of outflanking manoeuvers available to teams can add significant\
      \ depth and replayability to a map.\n\n==Vehicles Overview==\n\nThere are the\
      \ stock vehicles that came with the original release of UT2004:\n* Raptors are\
      \ excellent against land and air targets but in a sky full of Avrils they won't\
      \ last too long.  They can be a very quick way of getting from A to B as they\
      \ are not tied to the terrain unlike the rest of the vehicles.\n* Tanks are\
      \ powerful and slow moving.  Use their lack of speed to offset their devastating\
      \ firepower.  The vertical angle at which the primary tank gun can aim is restricted\
      \ so Tanks can be disadvantaged when travelling on slopes.\n* Hellbenders are\
      \ a good way of moving a bunch of people around quickly, and are excellent at\
      \  destroying infantry.  Put them up against a tank and they won't last too\
      \ long.\n* Scorpions are reasonably fast and can be an inconvenience to soldiers\
      \ on foot.  They are good for taking out Power Nodes and Mantas.  A fully charged\
      \ ''bola'' does a suprising amount of damage.\n* Mantas are a very fast way\
      \ of getting around, but get killed easily.  They are excellent against Tanks\
      \ without Avril support.  The Manta's primary fire is an excellent way of taking\
      \ out Power Nodes from a long distance.  They are also good for squishing players\
      \ on foot.\n* Leviathans are very big, very powerful, and very slow.  A fully\
      \ manned Leviathan is quite fearsome - when it eventually arrives.\n\nAdditionally,\
      \ there are ECE (Editor's Choice Edition) vehicles. These vehicles are considered\
      \ stock by the community and so you should not ignore them. Most new maps these\
      \ days include ECE vehicles.\n* Cicadas are the most powerful weapon for taking\
      \ down a node, and are not nearly as good at other things. They can take down\
      \ tanks and Levis faster than any other vehicle, when used by expert pilots,\
      \ but it is more risky than using a Raptor to do so if the enemy team has Raptors\
      \ of their own in the sky protecting their tanks and Levis. Raptors can easily\
      \ take down Cicadas. Almost all pilots have a very tough time killing ground\
      \ troops with Cicadas (because it is HARD especially with higher pings).\n*\
      \ SPMAs are great for shelling contested nodes near the center. They are sometimes\
      \ placed in such a way as to defend the enemy's primary node once it has been\
      \ captured, which is an acceptable use of them. But you should avoid placing\
      \ them in such a way as to suggest their use in spawn killing the losing team\
      \ at their power core. That is not fun for the losing team and players will\
      \ hate your map.\n* Paladins are for defense. Defense! Got it? They are for\
      \ shielding nodes and killing nearby attackers. They are NOT for cross country\
      \ rides to grandmother's house.\n\n==Vehicle Placement==\n\nThe golden rule\
      \ here is balance.  Your vehicle placement is the PRIMARY way in which you can\
      \ directly affect how much power the winning team has against the losing team.\
      \ Generally each Power Node will have between 2 and 4 vehicles associated with\
      \ it.  The larger the map the more vehicles will be needed as travelling between\
      \ Power Nodes on foot becomes less attractive and less effective.\n\nFor making\
      \ maps that really shine in gameplay, and support the kinds of strategies and\
      \ tactics experienced ONS players would like to use, follow these tips:\n* Try\
      \ to limit the placements of tanks. Prefer to place them in the base AND/OR\
      \ at a central contested node. Avoid placing tanks at other nodes as this generally\
      \ gives the winning team too much of advantage over the losing team.\n* A similar\
      \ reasoning applies to Leviathans. They are best placed at each power core OR\
      \ at a single central contested node (but not both). Giving the winning team\
      \ more than one Leviathan is a BAD idea.\n* Paladins are slow and vulnerable\
      \ critters. But they make excellent defense vehicles for nodes. Not only can\
      \ they sheild the node, but they can even kill ground troops that get close\
      \ by using the Paladin combo (while sheild is up, press fire to make a local\
      \ shockwave for personal defense). Place Paladins ONLY at or near primary or\
      \ secondary nodes. Do not place them at a node that is far away from the nodes\
      \ they would be useful to defend. Avoid placing them at the power core, unless\
      \ it is a short drive to the primary node.\n* Avoid placing Mantas all over\
      \ the map at various nodes. Giving the winning team a hell of a lot of Mantas\
      \ is a bad thing. It makes it nearly impossible for the losing team to make\
      \ a comeback when they are constantly being roadkilled, and every time they\
      \ get their primary node back up, 5 mantas attack it again. Prefer to put 2\
      \ or 3 Mantas at each power core, and a sparse number at various nodes throughout\
      \ the map.\n* Scorpians are great for taking out tanks, as well as mantas in\
      \ narrow channels. You may wish to place them with these goals in mind to help\
      \ the losing team fight back.\n* The Raptor is the most versitile vehicle of\
      \ the lot. It can be used to take out enemy aircraft (both Raptors and Cicadas),\
      \ sniff out enemy snipers and campers hiding in trees and rubble, kill tanks,\
      \ Levis, Mantas, and so on. In fact, the best use of the Raptor is as a predator\
      \ of other vehicles (thus its name). There really is no substitute for this.\
      \ Cicadas are NOT good replacements for Raptors (why? because enemy Raptors\
      \ 'eat Cicadas for lunch.'). Do not think placing a Cicada at the power core\
      \ will be sufficient. You should always have at least one Raptor there. This\
      \ gives a losing team at least some chance of fighting off the tanks and Levis\
      \ that are slaughtering them, and makes the game more interesting and comeback-possible.\n\
      \nSee also [[Legacy:Vehicle Gameplay|Vehicle Gameplay]].\n\n==Weapon Placement==\n\
      * At the Power Core make sure there is a good mix of hitscan and projectile\
      \ weapons.  There's nothing worse than trying to take back a Primary Node only\
      \ to find that your best weapon is the short range Flak Cannon (Remember that\
      \ the Link gun is much more important in Onslaught than in many other, if not\
      \ all, gametypes). \n* The Weapon Lockers at each Power Node should contain\
      \ a different selection of weapons.  As with the Power Core a mix of hitscan\
      \ and projectile weapons is preferred.\n* A ''full'' Weapon Locker can be collected\
      \ by any player at any time irrespective of whether it is next to a Power Node\
      \ controlled by the other team.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Inventory Item Placement|Inventory\
      \ Item Placement]].\n\n==Map Checklist==\n* Have you set up the Power Node network?\
      \  Hit ESC in game and click on the Link Designer.\n* Do you have any vehicles\
      \ spawning at a Power Node that are facing the wrong way for one team but the\
      \ right way for another?\n* Can you reliably teleport between all of the Power\
      \ Nodes - arriving at the Power Node you expect (odd things can happen if ''node\
      \ areas'' overlap).\n* Do you wishto ship more than one Power Node setup with\
      \ your map?\n* Show level properties.  Make sure LevelInfo.DefaultGameType is\
      \ set to <tt>Onslaught.ONSOnslaughtGame</tt>.\n\n==External Links (Tutorials)==\n\
