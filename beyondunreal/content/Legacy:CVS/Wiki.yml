      \ general introduction to [[Legacy:CVS|CVS]] is available on, well, [[Legacy:CVS|CVS]].\n\
      \n==Getting Started ==\n\nHead over to [[Legacy:CVS|CVS]], select a CVS client\
      \ of your choice for your operating system and install it.  I'll be explaining\
      \ the steps using [http://www.wincvs.org WinCvs], but generally they're always\
      \ the same.\n\n\n\n\n[[Image:Legacy_cvs-checkout-settings.gif|right|]]\n\nFirst\

      \ repository.  You'll only have to do this once; see \"Updating\" below for\
      \ how to get the latest versions of the files later.  Select ''Create'' -> ''Checkout\
      \ module'', and you'll be presented with the following dialog box.\n\n* In the\
      \ ''Enter the module name and path'' field (at the top), enter <code>UnrealWiki</code>.\
      \  That is the name I have given the entire bunch of files in the repository.\n\
      \n* In the ''Local folder to checkout to'', enter (or better: select using the\
      \ button with the three dots to the right of this field) the folder on your\
      \ harddisk you want the files to be copied to.  Note that the client will create\
      \ a subdirectory <code>UnrealWiki</code> in the folder you select.  If you don't\
      \ like that name, click the ''Override'' checkbox above and enter whatever other\
      \ name is more to your liking in the ''Checkout as'' field.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_cvs-checkout-general.gif|right|]]\n\
      \nAfter that, click the ''General'' tab.\n\n* The ''CVSROOT'' setting contains\
      \ your '''user name''', the '''CVS server address''' and the '''repository location'''\
      \ on that server.  If you send me an email as detailed above, I'll give you\
      \ this information.\n\n* In the ''Authentication'' drop-down box select \"passwd\
      \ file on the cvs server\".\n\n[[Image:Legacy_cvs-checkout-globals.gif|right|]]\n\
      \nThen click the ''Globals'' tab.\n\n* Uncheck the ''Checkout read-only'' option.\n\
      \n* If you're on a really slow Internet connection, you can check ''Use TCP/IP\
      \ compression'' to have the data transparently compressed before it's sent to\
      \ or received from the CVS server.  If you have a really fast connection, the\
      \ processing overhead required by that compression usually takes more time than\
      \ using it saves.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you're '''connected to the Internet'''\
      \ and click ''OK''.  The client will then connect to the CVS server and download\
      \ all files, copying them to your harddisk at the location you specified.  Congrats!\

      \ have to '''update''' your working copy.\n\n\n\n\n[[Image:Legacy_cvs-update.gif|right|]]\n\
      \nFor that, select the directory or the file (or multiple files) you want to\
      \ update in WinCvs's browser.  Select ''Modify'' -> ''Update selection'' and\
      \ you'll be presented with this dialog box.\n\n* The option ''Create missing\
      \ directories that exist in the repository'' is handy if you know that somebody\
      \ added a directory (with files in it) in the repository.  Otherwise you can\

      \ changes ''and'' the changes other people made and committed to the repository.\n\
      \nIf a change you made ''collides'' with another one of another person, you'll\
      \ get an '''edit conflict''' and will be warned by the client.  Then you'll\
      \ have to manually go through the affected file and sort everything out before\
      \ you can commit your own changes.\n\n\n\nIf you just want to see what was changed\
      \ without actually updating anything, select ''Query'' -> ''Query update'' and\
      \ watch WinCvs's log window.  It'll give you the same information it gives you\

      \  Do you have that enabled?  (I thought it was disabled by default; if it's\
      \ not, I'll have to add that to the description above.)\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  It\
      \ was checked by default. \n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Fixed. I changed their status\
      \ from windows ... I'll see what happens next time I check out files. I've committed\
      \ changes BTW. woohoo!\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  Next question: how does CVS decide\
      \ if the next version number after 1.3 is 1.4 or 1.3.1 ?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \  That must be manually specified when committing a file; otherwise CVS will\
      \ happily continue incrementing the version number following the dot.  I don't\
      \ see yet how that would work with WinCvs though.  The other parts of the number\
      \ initially displayed as 1.1.1.1 are related to branching; see [http://www-es.fernuni-hagen.de/cgi-bin/info2html?(cvs)Branches%20and%20revisions\
      \ this page] for more info.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  I see. I thought something like\
      \ 1.3.1 was for a small change, which my last update was. I think we can live\
      \ without branching... :)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Well, actually there's a benefit\
      \ of regarding all sorts of changes the same by unanimously incrementing the\
      \ last partial version number &ndash; you're relieved from the duty of (reproducibly)\
      \ judging whether a change is a \"small\" or a \"large\" one.  For that matter,\
      \ all changes committed to the repository should be \"small\" ones, at least\
      \ and definitely in terms of the amount of text necessary to describe them in\
      \ the log.  (Where \"Fixed typo\" would have the same subjective size as \"\
      Implemented world formula.\")"
