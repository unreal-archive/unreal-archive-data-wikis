      \ work properly with the Mozilla 1.8.2 Alpha; the context menu for edits doesn't\
      \ display the page specific information. The topmost item in the context menu\
      \ says \"Title\", ect. I would report this to Mozilla myself, but lacking basic\
      \ understanding as to how this component works, it might be more fitting for\
      \ someone else to do so. For instance, El Muerte as he is the creator of the\
      \ component or Mychaeel, being the ominpotent WikiMaster and Thunderbird hacker.</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte:</b> I noticed that too when I tried Mozilla 1.8.2 Alpha. Since\
      \ other things of mozilla didn't work properly too I went back to 1.7.2 (1.8\
      \ is alpha anyway). Anyway, the context menu is filled via JavaScript, and pretty\
      \ much all other functionality is done via JavaScript. Haven't done any other\
      \ research why it doesn't work. But my experience with alpha releases of Mozilla\
      \ is that often something gets broken over time (nightly builds are even worse).</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte:</b> Ok, I've made some major changes to the mozwiki code. Some\
      \ new features and major preformance improvements. Also issues with mozilla\
      \ 1.8 have been fixed. I've moved the configuration to a seperate file (easier\
      \ for future releases). The new code is available at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external free\" href=\"http://unreal.elmuerte.com/mozwiki.zip\">http://unreal.elmuerte.com/mozwiki.zip</a>\
      \ .</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> Bump!?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Maybe mention this\
      \ in featured pages? Do you need me to install anything on the wiki site? Last\
      \ time I tried to do something like that I never managed to get the recent changes\
      \ thing working properly&#160;:(</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> yeah, you have to\
      \ replace the current sidebar PHP code with the PHP files in the above archive.\
      \ The most important thing to configure is the $conf[\"datapath\"] variable.\
      \ To point to the location of the data directory. I assume that the way data\
      \ is stored in the UnrealWiki is still the same as in a stock UseMod wiki. Secondly,\
      \ you need to change the $conf[\"sidebar_cmd\"] variable so the first part point\
      \ to the absolute directory of the wiki.pl script. This is used for the special\
      \ sidebar. Last time this didn't work using method #1, but I think I fixed it\
      \ now (at least it worked for in my test wiki). If it doesn't work, just change\
      \ the $conf[\"sidebar_access\"] variable to 2. For the rest everything should\
      \ be correct. And ofcourse you have to rename the file <code>mozwiki.config.php.dist</code>\
      \ to <code>mozwiki.config.php</code> This is to make it easier for future updates\
      \ of the real script code.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> hmm, since <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_Sidebar\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Wiki Sidebar\">Wiki Sidebar</a> is now read only, sidebar_access\
      \ mode 2 doesn't work anymore. So method 1 has to be used (or I have to change\
      \ the code parsing of mode 2).</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I don't know if it works\
      \ becuase I have 2 sidebars with the same name&#160;:( But I think it's yours\
      \ that says:</p>\n<pre>\nwiki.pl execution failed:\n\nArray\n(\n)\nXML Parsing\
      \ Error: no element found\nLocation: http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/misc/integration/mozwiki.php\n\
      Line Number 19, Column 1:\n^\n</pre>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> double check the\
      \ value of <code>$conf[\"sidebar_cmd\"]</code>. It should be something like:</p>\n\
      <pre>$conf[\"sidebar_cmd\"] = \"/full/path/to/the/wiki.pl action=edit\\&amp;id=\"\
      ;\n</pre>\n<p>When the <code>/full/path/to/the/wiki.pl</code> is the full path\
      \ as seen by the webserver.</p>\n<p>And just thought about this, if the it can't\
      \ edit the page via http it also can't edit the page via commandline. So I guess\
      \ I'll have to rewrite the sidebar access. For now, just set <code>$conf[\"\
      sidebar_access\"] = 0</code>. So the rest will just work. I will try to fix\
      \ it asap.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Ok, will do. But instead of running the Perl\
      \ script from your PHP, why don't you just take a look inside the data dir,\
      \ since you have the path for that?</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> that's the idea,\
      \ but at first I didn't want to bother figuring out the data file format&#160;;)\
      \ (call it being lazy)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Look at the way I did it in wiki.pl\
      \ (I can't remember if I made the patch available... I did it VERY roughly:</p>\n\
      <pre>\n    $fileName = &amp;GetPageFile('Wiki_Sidebar');\n    if (-f $fileName)\
      \ {\n      ($status, $data) = &amp;ReadFile($fileName);\n      }\n    if (!$status)\
      \ { \n      # finish error-checking later...\n      }\n    $data =~ s[$FS3(text)$FS3(.*?)----(.*?)$FS3(.*)]{\n\
      \      $sidebarText = $3;\n      }es;\n</pre>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> ok, made\
      \ the changes, should work now. Download the zip again, and overwrite the mozwiki.php\
      \ script with the one in the archive. set <code>$conf[\"sidebar_access\"] =\
      \ 3</code>. If the sidebar doesn't show up (e.g. only the default links), just\
      \ make a minor edit to the <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_Sidebar\" title=\"Legacy:Wiki\
      \ Sidebar\">Wiki Sidebar</a> so the file change time is updated.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ It works&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> Tarquin or Michaeel, can you upload\
      \ an updated version of this sidebar ( <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
      \ free\" href=\"http://unreal.elmuerte.com/mozwiki.zip\">http://unreal.elmuerte.com/mozwiki.zip</a>\
      \ ), I've fixed a few minor bugs and added support for the image rc hack. Simply\
      \ replace the existing mozwiki.php file with the new one and add the following\
      \ entries to the mozwiki.config.php file:</p>\n<pre>\n$conf[\"imagehack\"] =\
      \ true;\n$conf[\"image_view\"] = $conf[\"basehost\"].\"/cgi-bin/imageupload.cgi/wiki-ext/imagedisplay.htt?imageid=\"\

      \ browser besides Mozilla, Netscape or Opera, (un)installing as described above\
      \ might not work. You should make sure your browser supports sidebars. If it\
      \ does and the install link still doesn't work, look for an option to add a\
      \ sidebar manually. The address of the sidebar itself is: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\

      >http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/misc/integration/mozwiki.php</a></p>\n<p>There's\
      \ quite a few Gecko-based browsers around - as more users use the sidebars for\
      \ these browsers, they are welcome to note their experiences on this page. If\
      \ you try to install the sidebar, and there's no option to add it, check your\
      \ browser's documentation, or, if you're adventurous, try editing the files\
      \ storing your browser's configuration.</p>\n<p>If your gecko-based browser\
      \ isn't listed below, and you get the sidebar to work, please add details on\
      \ how you managed to do it. If you can't, please leave a note, and we will try\

      <p>Perhaps this a problem with the HTML file used, not the browsers, after all.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> I checked and it seems that in the process of updating the\
      \ stylesheets for the new template system they were broken for the browser sidebar.\
      \ That's not a browser-related problem.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> That's a probably\
      \ feature. BODY is no longer given a background colour, the DIVs are. Either:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>change the HTML to enclose everything in a DIV of the correct class</li>\n\
      <li>change the HTML to BODY class=\"something\" and I will change the CSS accordingly</li>\n\
      <li>on the other hand, wide PRE or USCRIPT text ends up on white background,\
      \ so I might change it.&#160;:)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Keep in mind\
      \ that if you don't define a background color, the default is not <i>white</i>;\
      \ it's whatever the user configured in his or her browser. For me, it's light\
      \ gray. So giving the &lt;body&gt; a defined background color definitely is\
      \ a good idea. Also, the background color is not the only thing that got lost;\
      \ the fonts did too. – I suggest that you check your features for unwanted side\
      \ effects like that in future before implementing them. &#160;:-)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ I still haven't managed to install some of the sidebars, and some of them\
      \ still don't seem to work – in particular one of the Mozilla ones where I was\
      \ asked to make some settings in the perl script. If people tell me what classes\
      \ the sidebar uses which are broken, I'll look into it. But the sidebar writers\
      \ could update the HTML to match the new classes.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> The\
      \ one and only Wiki Browser Sidebar we're talking about here is <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external free\" href=\"http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/wiki-search.cgi\"\
      >http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/wiki-search.cgi</a>, and I'm the author.\
      \ I consider this part of the Unreal Wiki website, and as a visitor I'd expect\
      \ that it wasn't broken by anything that was changed in other parts of the site.\
      \ – The sidebar's HTML templates are wiki-ext/search.<i>something</i>.htt.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Ok. I'll have it fixed, probably tonight.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ *slowly gets it* it's the <i>same</i> sidebar for IE6 and Opera, just a different\
      \ link to install it? And it can be run on Moz too? In that case, I will completely\
      \ reorganize the above. We have TWO sidebars, one multi-browser, one Moz-only.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Yes, that's right. It's only one sidebar.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ The background color is light-blue, but the logo is on a sidebar-blue background;\
      \ that looks weird. Please make the sidebar background dark-blue as well. Also,\
      \ some of the fonts aren't correct yet. – For that matter, I just realized that\
      \ the <a href=\"/Legacy:Wiki_Sidebar\" title=\"Legacy:Wiki Sidebar\">Wiki Sidebar</a>\
      \ uses no fixed font or font size; rather it inherits the user's browser preferences.\
      \ Given that everything else is fixed that's not a good idea. While you're at\
      \ it, I suggest you use Arial instead of Times there.</p>\n<p><b>tarquin:</b>\
      \ in that case, two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I use a body class=\"sidebar\" and\
      \ add selectors in the main stylesheet</li>\n<li>I make a sidebar-only stylesheet.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<p>which do you think is best?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Making a CSS\
      \ class selector, I guess.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> I'm afraid that the sidebar\
      \ layout still doesn't look as it should (fonts don't match, background color\
      \ too light). tarquin: Do you need more information, or should I tackle this?\
      \ (Though I don't know what exactly you changed in the styles when implementing\
      \ the new template system earlier.)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> It's on my list.\
      \ I'll do it soon, maybe this afternoon.&#160;:) (you concentrate on JB!&#160;:D\
      \ ) ... done!&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Hmm – something changed, but\
      \ somehow not to the better... now my personal links are spread apart and the\
      \ headers are still in 12pt Times while they <i>should</i> be in 9pt Arial.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> I think I will give the sidebar its own stylesheet to avoid\
      \ conflicts like this.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Actually, the idea behind using\
      \ the same style sheet was that changes in those styles would automatically\
      \ reflect in the side bar. I didn't expect that fundamental settings like font\
      \ faces and sizes would be taken out of the &lt;body&gt; tag. – It's a bit better\
      \ now (the font faces are right), but now the text in the tables has 12pt instead\
      \ of 9pt. And the background is still light-blue instead of dark-blue.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> if you want it integrated again, I could maybe use the same\
      \ class as the sidebar, dark blue background with thin white dividers (instead\
      \ of HR).</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> We're getting closer – fonts are fine, just\
      \ too large (still inherit the usually 12pt from the browser's own configuration).</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARG.\
      \ It's because text inside a TABLE doesn't inherit from the parent BODY or DIV.\
      \ Stupid css. Must be a bug, surely?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Don't know – just\
      \ that all CSS-compliant browsers I tried do it alike. By the way: While the\
      \ bookmarks themselves look good now, the \"Bookmarks\" title is still too large.\
      \ – That iteration cycle strikes me as pretty inefficient, actually. How about\
      \ you just try looking at the sidebar page yourself after each attempt of fixing\
      \ it?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I don't use it, so I'm not exactly sure what you\
      \ (the designer&#160;:)) wants from it. Plus I can't view it locally; it's only\
      \ with a quick hack that I'm able to view the results on the header, but without\
      \ the generated content. I need to save a static dummy version to play with.\
      \ If I have time, I might remodel it to use DIVs and floats instead of tables,\
      \ subject to your approval. I'll certainly switch those headings to headings\
      \ tags.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> It should be clear from the screenshots on\
      \ this page how it's supposed to look, I think.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Working\
      \ on it. May I suggest this instead of a table:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"\

      \ every 15 minutes, but you can do a manual refresh by clicking the ''Update''\
      \ menu item.\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n'''Kali:''' This doesn't work properly with\
      \ the Mozilla 1.8.2 Alpha; the context menu for edits doesn't display the page\
      \ specific information. The topmost item in the context menu says \"Title\"\
      , ect. I would report this to Mozilla myself, but lacking basic understanding\
      \ as to how this component works, it might be more fitting for someone else\
      \ to do so. For instance, El Muerte as he is the creator of the component or\
      \ Mychaeel, being the ominpotent WikiMaster and Thunderbird hacker.\n\n'''El\
      \ Muerte:''' I noticed that too when I tried Mozilla 1.8.2 Alpha. Since other\
      \ things of mozilla didn't work properly too I went back to 1.7.2 (1.8 is alpha\
      \ anyway). Anyway, the context menu is filled via JavaScript, and pretty much\
      \ all other functionality is done via JavaScript. Haven't done any other research\
      \ why it doesn't work. But my experience with alpha releases of Mozilla is that\
      \ often something gets broken over time (nightly builds are even worse).\n\n\
      '''El Muerte:''' Ok, I've made some major changes to the mozwiki code. Some\
      \ new features and major preformance improvements. Also issues with mozilla\
      \ 1.8 have been fixed. I've moved the configuration to a seperate file (easier\
      \ for future releases). The new code is available at http://unreal.elmuerte.com/mozwiki.zip\
      \ . \n\n'''El Muerte:''' Bump!?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Maybe mention this in featured\
      \ pages? Do you need me to install anything on the wiki site? Last time I tried\
      \ to do something like that I never managed to get the recent changes thing\
      \ working properly :(\n\n'''El Muerte:''' yeah, you have to replace the current\
      \ sidebar PHP code with the PHP files in the above archive. The most important\
      \ thing to configure is the $conf[\"datapath\"] variable. To point to the location\
      \ of the data directory. I assume that the way data is stored in the UnrealWiki\
      \ is still the same as in a stock UseMod wiki. Secondly, you need to change\
      \ the $conf[\"sidebar_cmd\"] variable so the first part point to the absolute\
      \ directory of the wiki.pl script. This is used for the special sidebar. Last\
      \ time this didn't work using method #1, but I think I fixed it now (at least\
      \ it worked for in my test wiki). If it doesn't work, just change the $conf[\"\
      sidebar_access\"] variable to 2. For the rest everything should be correct.\
      \ And ofcourse you have to rename the file <code>mozwiki.config.php.dist</code>\
      \ to <code>mozwiki.config.php</code> This is to make it easier for future updates\
      \ of the real script code.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' hmm, since [[Legacy:Wiki Sidebar|Wiki\
      \ Sidebar]] is now read only, sidebar_access mode 2 doesn't work anymore. So\
      \ method 1 has to be used (or I have to change the code parsing of mode 2).\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' I don't know if it works becuase I have 2 sidebars with the\
      \ same name :( But I think it's yours that says:\n\n<pre>\nwiki.pl execution\
      \ failed:\n\nArray\n(\n)\nXML Parsing Error: no element found\nLocation: http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/misc/integration/mozwiki.php\n\
      Line Number 19, Column 1:\n^\n</pre>\n\n'''El Muerte:''' double check the value\
      \ of <code>$conf[\"sidebar_cmd\"]</code>. It should be something like:\n $conf[\"\
      sidebar_cmd\"] = \"/full/path/to/the/wiki.pl action=edit\\&id=\";\n\nWhen the\
      \ <code>/full/path/to/the/wiki.pl</code> is the full path as seen by the webserver.\
      \ \n\nAnd just thought about this, if the it can't edit the page via http it\
      \ also can't edit the page via commandline. So I guess I'll have to rewrite\
      \ the sidebar access. For now, just set <code>$conf[\"sidebar_access\"] = 0</code>.\
      \ So the rest will just work. I will try to fix it asap.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Ok,\
      \ will do. But instead of running the Perl script from your PHP, why don't you\
      \ just take a look inside the data dir, since you have the path for that?\n\n\
      '''El Muerte:''' that's the idea, but at first I didn't want to bother figuring\
      \ out the data file format ;) (call it being lazy)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Look at\
      \ the way I did it in wiki.pl (I can't remember if I made the patch available...\
      \ I did it VERY roughly:\n\n<pre>\n    $fileName = &GetPageFile('Wiki_Sidebar');\n\
      \    if (-f $fileName) {\n      ($status, $data) = &ReadFile($fileName);\n \
      \     }\n    if (!$status) { \n      # finish error-checking later...\n    \
      \  }\n    $data =~ s[$FS3(text)$FS3(.*?)----(.*?)$FS3(.*)]{\n      $sidebarText\
      \ = $3;\n      }es;\n</pre>\n\n'''El Muerte:''' ok, made the changes, should\
      \ work now. Download the zip again, and overwrite the mozwiki.php script with\
      \ the one in the archive. set <code>$conf[\"sidebar_access\"] = 3</code>. If\
      \ the sidebar doesn't show up (e.g. only the default links), just make a minor\
      \ edit to the [[Legacy:Wiki Sidebar|Wiki Sidebar]] so the file change time is\
      \ updated.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' It works :)\n\n'''El Muerte:''' Tarquin or Michaeel,\
      \ can you upload an updated version of this sidebar ( http://unreal.elmuerte.com/mozwiki.zip\
      \ ), I've fixed a few minor bugs and added support for the image rc hack. Simply\
      \ replace the existing mozwiki.php file with the new one and add the following\
      \ entries to the mozwiki.config.php file:\n\n<pre>\n$conf[\"imagehack\"] = true;\n\
      $conf[\"image_view\"] = $conf[\"basehost\"].\"/cgi-bin/imageupload.cgi/wiki-ext/imagedisplay.htt?imageid=\"\
      ;\n$conf[\"image_rev\"] = $conf[\"basehost\"].\"/cgi-bin/imageupload.cgi/wiki-ext/imagerevisions.htt?imageid=\"\
      ;\n</pre>\n\n==Opera ==\n\n\n\n\n[[Image:Legacy_integration-opera-search-sidebar.gif|left|]]\n\
      \n\n\n\n===Install ===\n\n[[SidebarOpera:wiki-search|Click here]] to install\
      \ the Unreal Wiki sidebar for Opera.\n\n===Uninstall ===\n\nRight-click the\
      \ ''Unreal Wiki'' tab in the sidebar window and select ''Delete panel''.\n\n\
      ===Usage===\n\nTo search the Wiki, enter your search topic into the text box\
      \ and hit enter.  Below the text bar, there are some useful quick links.\n\n\
      \n\n\n\n==Other Gecko-based browsers ==\n\nIf you are using a Gecko-based browser\
      \ besides Mozilla, Netscape or Opera, (un)installing as described above might\
      \ not work.  You should make sure your browser supports sidebars.  If it does\
      \ and the install link still doesn't work, look for an option to add a sidebar\
      \ manually.  The address of the sidebar itself is: http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/misc/integration/mozwiki.php\n\
      \nThere's quite a few Gecko-based browsers around - as more users use the sidebars\
      \ for these browsers, they are welcome to note their experiences on this page.\
      \  If you try to install the sidebar, and there's no option to add it, check\
      \ your browser's documentation, or, if you're adventurous, try editing the files\
      \ storing your browser's configuration.\n\nIf your gecko-based browser isn't\
      \ listed below, and you get the sidebar to work, please add details on how you\
      \ managed to do it.  If you can't, please leave a note, and we will try to help\
      \ you.\n\n===Getting the Opera panel on Mozilla===\n\nAdd the following text\
      \ to your profile's panels.rdf file:\n\n<uscript>\n<RDF:Description about=\"\
      urn:sidebar:3rdparty-panel:http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/wiki-search.cgi\"\
      \n        NC:title=\"Unreal Wiki\"\n        NC:content=\"http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/wiki-search.cgi\"\
      \n        NC:customize=\"http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki?action=editprefs\"\
      \n        NC:persist=\"false\" />\n</uscript>\n\n===Galeon===\n\nGaleon (tested:\
      \ 1.3.3) supports the (Mozilla) sidebar without a problem.  The installation\
      \ described above does work, but it doesn't ask for a confirmation and installs\
      \ right away.  Deletion is a matter of opening the sidebar and pressing the\
      \ trashcan button.\n\n==Comments ==\n\nThe background is white, not light blue,\
      \ in these browsers:\n*IE6\n*Opera\n\nAdd your browser to the list if you expierience\
      \ the same problem in a different browser.\n\nPerhaps this a problem with the\
      \ HTML file used, not the browsers, after all.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I checked\
      \ and it seems that in the process of updating the stylesheets for the new template\
      \ system they were broken for the browser sidebar.  That's not a browser-related\
      \ problem.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' That's a probably feature. BODY is no longer given\
      \ a background colour, the DIVs are. Either:\n# change the HTML to enclose everything\
      \ in a DIV of the correct class\n# change the HTML to BODY class=\"something\"\
      \ and I will change the CSS accordingly\n# on the other hand, wide PRE or USCRIPT\
      \ text ends up on white background, so I might change it. :)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Keep in mind that if you don't define a background color, the default is not\
      \ ''white''; it's whatever the user configured in his or her browser.  For me,\
      \ it's light gray.  So giving the <body> a defined background color definitely\
      \ is a good idea. Also, the background color is not the only thing that got\
      \ lost; the fonts did too. &ndash; I suggest that you check your features for\
      \ unwanted side effects like that in future before implementing them.  :-)\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' I still haven't managed to install some of the sidebars, and\
      \ some of them still don't seem to work &ndash; in particular one of the Mozilla\
      \ ones where I was asked to make some settings in the perl script. If people\
      \ tell me what classes the sidebar uses which are broken, I'll look into it.\
      \ But the sidebar writers could update the HTML to match the new classes.\n\n\
      '''Mychaeel:''' The one and only Wiki Browser Sidebar we're talking about here\
      \ is http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/wiki-search.cgi, and I'm the author.\
      \  I consider this part of the Unreal Wiki website, and as a visitor I'd expect\
      \ that it wasn't broken by anything that was changed in other parts of the site.\
      \ &ndash; The sidebar's HTML templates are wiki-ext/search.''something''.htt.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' Ok. I'll have it fixed, probably tonight. :)\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ *slowly gets it* it's the ''same'' sidebar for IE6 and Opera, just a different\
      \ link to install it? And it can be run on Moz too? In that case, I will completely\
      \ reorganize the above. We have TWO sidebars, one multi-browser, one Moz-only.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Yes, that's right.  It's only one sidebar.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ The background color is light-blue, but the logo is on a sidebar-blue background;\
      \ that looks weird.  Please make the sidebar background dark-blue as well. \
      \ Also, some of the fonts aren't correct yet. &ndash; For that matter, I just\
      \ realized that the [[Legacy:Wiki Sidebar|Wiki Sidebar]] uses no fixed font\
      \ or font size; rather it inherits the user's browser preferences.  Given that\
      \ everything else is fixed that's not a good idea.  While you're at it, I suggest\
      \ you use Arial instead of Times there.\n\n'''tarquin:''' in that case, two\
      \ options:\n# I use a body class=\"sidebar\" and add selectors in the main stylesheet\n\
      # I make a sidebar-only stylesheet.\n\nwhich do you think is best?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Making a CSS class selector, I guess.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I'm afraid that the\
      \ sidebar layout still doesn't look as it should (fonts don't match, background\
      \ color too light).  tarquin:  Do you need more information, or should I tackle\
      \ this?  (Though I don't know what exactly you changed in the styles when implementing\
      \ the new template system earlier.)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' It's on my list. I'll\
      \ do it soon, maybe this afternoon. :) (you concentrate on JB! :D ) ... done!\
      \ :D\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Hmm &ndash; something changed, but somehow not to the\
      \ better... now my personal links are spread apart and the headers are still\
      \ in 12pt Times while they ''should'' be in 9pt Arial.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I think\
      \ I will give the sidebar its own stylesheet to avoid conflicts like this.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Actually, the idea behind using the same style sheet was that\
      \ changes in those styles would automatically reflect in the side bar.  I didn't\
      \ expect that fundamental settings like font faces and sizes would be taken\
      \ out of the <body> tag. &ndash; It's a bit better now (the font faces are right),\
      \ but now the text in the tables has 12pt instead of 9pt.  And the background\
      \ is still light-blue instead of dark-blue.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' if you want it\
      \ integrated again, I could maybe use the same class as the sidebar, dark blue\
      \ background with thin white dividers (instead of HR).\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' We're\
      \ getting closer &ndash; fonts are fine, just too large (still inherit the usually\
      \ 12pt from the browser's own configuration).\n\n'''Tarquin:''' AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARG.\
      \ It's because text inside a TABLE doesn't inherit from the parent BODY or DIV.\
      \ Stupid css. Must be a bug, surely?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Don't know &ndash; just\
      \ that all CSS-compliant browsers I tried do it alike.  By the way:  While the\
      \ bookmarks themselves look good now, the \"Bookmarks\" title is still too large.\
      \ &ndash; That iteration cycle strikes me as pretty inefficient, actually. \
      \ How about you just try looking at the sidebar page yourself after each attempt\
      \ of fixing it?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I don't use it, so I'm not exactly sure what\
      \ you (the designer :)) wants from it. Plus I can't view it locally; it's only\
      \ with a quick hack that I'm able to view the results on the header, but without\
      \ the generated content. I need to save a static dummy version to play with.\
      \ If I have time, I might remodel it to use DIVs and floats instead of tables,\
      \ subject to your approval. I'll certainly switch those headings to headings\
      \ tags.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' It should be clear from the screenshots on this page\
      \ how it's supposed to look, I think.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Working on it. May I\
      \ suggest this instead of a table:\n\n<uscript>\nh1 {\n\tfont-family:Arial,\
      \ Helvetica, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size:9pt;\n\tborder:solid black 1px; /* just\
      \ for testing */\n\t}\nh1 a { \n\tfloat: right; \n\tpadding-left: 4px;\n\t}\n\
      \n\n<h1><a\n\thref=\"wiki-search.cgi?reset=all\" title=\"Mark all pages as read\"\

      </uscript>\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Not using a table won't work for the bookmarks\
      \ themselves though if a bookmark title spans several lines. &ndash; Nobody\
      \ ever said it was necessary to abolish all tables by all means.  Sometimes\
      \ a table simply is a table.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Agreed. That's just for the \"\
      bookmarks\" heading. I don't think I'll bother changing HR to DIV because I\
      \ can't test the script locally for some reason so it would take too long.\n\
