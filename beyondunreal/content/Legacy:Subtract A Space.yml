      \ thinks of the entire <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_World\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal\
      \ World\">Unreal world</a> as solid matter when you start a new map. So before\
      \ you do just about anything in UnrealEd, you'll need to make some space so\
      \ you've got somewhere to place things. This is called <b>subtracting</b>, because\
      \ we tell UnrealEd to remove a chunk of \"solid\" material and make a space\
      \ within it. This tutorial shows you how to do this. The space you create can\
      \ be a room, or a large outdoor space: that will all depend on how it is textured,\
      \ decorated and lit later on.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Instructions\"\

      Legacy:Toolbox\">toolbox</a> and is divided into several groups. In the 3rd\
      \ group of buttons, find the top-left button of that group is a blue-green cube.\
      \ (In UnrealEd 2 and later, each group can be collapsed, but normally this group\
      \ is visible.) Right-click the cube button.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div\

      \ on both <a href=\"/Legacy:Create_A_Room\" title=\"Legacy:Create A Room\">Create\
      \ a Room</a> and <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Subtract_A_Space/Functional_Map?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Subtract A Space/Functional Map (page does not\
      \ exist)\">Legacy:Subtract A Space/Functional Map</a> I would like to update\
      \ it so it contains more information which relates specifically to subtraction,\
      \ and remove the parts about creating a room. Before doing so I would track\
      \ down all links to this page and update them so they are in the proper context.\
      \ For instance, if I said \"Subtract a Space from your Added Space\" and linked\
      \ here, they would get a tutorial on how to build a room, which is not quite\
      \ right. Subtract a Space is an \"Element\" of the \"Process\" Create a Room.\
      \ I realize this is a longstanding argument on this WIKI. If you disagree with\
      \ my logic, Tarquin, simply delete my comment here and I will take that as a\
      \ \"No way\". Otherwise I will proceed with this simple restructuring in a few\
      \ days</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Well I don't really understand what is happening\
      \ here. <a href=\"/Legacy:Mapping_Lessons/Functional_Map\" title=\"Legacy:Mapping\
      \ Lessons/Functional Map\">Mapping Lessons/Functional Map</a> seems fairly pointless.\
      \ This page seems fairly specific to the subtracting action. Not sure what <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Create_A_Room\" title=\"Legacy:Create A Room\">Create a Room</a>\
      \ is for, since the point was to give a sequence of relatively small <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Mapping_Lessons\" title=\"Legacy:Mapping Lessons\">Mapping Lessons</a>\
      \ pages that work together. The way I planned it, this page works double: a)\
      \ a basic procedure and b) a step of the Lessons. Maybe the Lessons sequence\
      \ needs a page to come BEFORE this one, what do you think?</p>\n<p><b>Musicalglass:</b>\
      \ Well, although I agree with the the basic concept of having reusable bit's\
      \ of info, and I can relate to experienced programmer's impatience with wordy\
      \ procedures and agree with the cut to the chase style of describing procedures\
      \ on the Wiki, I think throwing people right into that is a little hard on beginners.\
      \ I try to keep in mind the posibilty of the 10 year old who is primarily a\
      \ gamer and the extent of his computer knowledge may be using AOL or something.\
      \ I think there should be at least one tutorial sequence which is written in\
      \ plain understandable language which familiarizes you with all the basic tools.\
      \ From there when you move on to the more advanced pages written in Wiki style,\
      \ it all makes more sense because now you're familiar with the terminology.\
      \ When I first started trying to learn Unreal I found the whole jumping around\
      \ from link to link thing very disorienting as each new page went off in another\
      \ myriad of directions and you quickly lost any sense of a comprehensive chain.\
      \ All I wanted was a simple beginner's tutorial which walked you through all\
      \ the basic tools and told you how to deal with any problems or misunderstandings\
      \ that might arise. But what I got was pages that were part of another incomplete\
      \ chain than what pertained to my specific question or that assumed that you\
      \ had already memorized one of the the other pages, which also went off in it's\
      \ own direction. I'm not sure what's up with Functional Map either. You can't\
      \ use it in a sentence for one thing. Seems to be in a folder and can't be linked\
      \ from all parts of the Wiki without a prefix, is that right? I appreciate someone's\
      \ efforts to ridgidly adhere to this Wiki language style, but I think it's not\
      \ graphic enough and makes more sense to those who are already familiar with\
      \ the application. Here's my line of thinking: put yourself in the shoes of\
      \ some kid who just discovered he can make his own levels for Unreal. What's\
      \ the first thing he wants to do? Get into the game. So clearly any begginer's\
      \ tutorial should cover building a room. By that time you've already familiarized\
      \ yourself with the basic concept of subtracting a space and now a separate\
      \ page is uneeded, unless you have a different question pertaining to subtraction\
      \ like, \"why don't the textures appear on the outside of My subtracted spaces?\"\
      \ etc. So if I were to come here, I would want to find everything there is to\
      \ know about subtraction. Same with placing a light. Already learned it in the\
      \ beginner's tute, but if I need more info, go to Place a Light, see? You've\
      \ got to look at each \"Element\" page and ask yourself if it works in all possible\
      \ contexts where someone might refer to it.</p>\n<p>Also I'm kind of pushing\
      \ for having two distinct chains of the same info; one is the light version\
      \ which shows you the simplest possible method to do one thing, (Mapping Lessons,\
      \ suggest rename to Beginners Guide) and then a second chain which details the\
      \ 6 different ways you can do this or that and covers each topic in detail.\
      \ What is currently Beginners Guide to Mapping is turned into an index page\
      \ just like mapping lessons and broken up into chapters; Texturing, Lighting,\
      \ etc. and is the encyclopedia of everything we know on the subject. Call that\
      \ Complete Guide to Mapping</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> About half of the <i>whole\
      \ wiki</i> is the \"Complete Guide to Mapping\". When you say \"6 different\
      \ ways you can do this or that\" do you mean the sort of bullet lists you get\
      \ on <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_Properties_Window\" title=\"Legacy:Actor Properties\
      \ Window\">Actor Properties Window</a>? Just read the first bullet and ignore\
      \ the rest&#160;;) I'll have a look at Mapping Lessons this week and see if\
      \ I can clean it up.</p>\n<p><b>Musicalglass:</b> Yup, pretty much.</p>\n<p>I\
      \ pondered the absurdity of my proposition for a couple days, looked over the\
      \ existing data there is to work with and, yeah about 75% of the Wiki would\
      \ end up under this topic. I made a rough draft for your consideration: The\
      \ <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Complete_Guide_To_Unreal_Editor?redlink=1\" class=\"\
      new\" title=\"Legacy:Complete Guide To Unreal Editor (page does not exist)\"\
      >Complete Guide to Unreal Editor</a>. I'm not going to dive into this ambitious\
      \ project for a bit, and it needs to go through the regular discussion phase.\
      \ I'm currently working on my update to <a href=\"/Legacy:Playing_Mesh_Animations\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Playing Mesh Animations\">Playing Mesh Animations</a>.</p>\n\
      <p>As far as my personal level of development, I would really, really like to\
      \ see you guys update the entire scripting section into something readable from\
      \ the standpoint of someone who has little or no knowledge of Java or C+. HelloWorld\
      \ is simple and to the point, but the pages before that that tell you how to\
      \ get set up for scripting are too technical. The prerequisite for doing HelloWorld\
      \ tells me to decompile all the source code. I don't need to do that to make\
      \ my first script. There's 4 highly technical pages about scripting before you\
      \ get to your first simple lesson. I think someone can do a My First Script\
      \ tutorial for Mapping Lessons which walks you through the procedure of getting\
      \ set up and compiling the HelloWorld script in fairly straightforward language\
      \ assuming no knowledge of what a command prompt is or anything obvious to a\
      \ programmer. Then we need some pages of short practical working examples of\
      \ Unreal Script. Most of the scripting pages assume prior knowledge of programming\
      \ and the examples are abstracts dealing with pizzas and anchovies but no simple\
      \ examples of dealing with ammo counts and firing rates, etc.</p>\n<p>Someone\
      \ needs to make a Scripting Basics tutorial which assumes no knowledge of programming.\
      \ Somebody could just take one of those books of beginning C+ and plagerize\
      \ it essentially, translating everything into unreal script. Start by explaining\
      \ what variables are and show you how to declare variables in unreal script\
      \ and then go on to show you how to actually do things with them with a bunch\
      \ of simple code snippets: To take the Ammo count and add 1 to it, do this,\
      \ to make it so every time you get shot your health is reduced by 50% do that.\
      \ To make it so the door won't open till you hit it 3 times do this. You see?\
      \ Then beginner's can take better advantage of the wealth of existing scripting\
      \ information available here. In my new tutorial: <a href=\"/Legacy:Playing_Mesh_Animations\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Playing Mesh Animations\">Playing Mesh Animations</a>, near\
      \ the bottom I have explored the possibility of taking simple translational\
      \ values and manipulating them with unreal script, using the rotation of a simple\
      \ mesh cube. I would like to extend that into Scripting for Beginners so you\
      \ can take the visual feedback of a moving object and do various things with\
      \ it using script: like using different states to change the movement and so\
      \ forth. That way beginners can learn scripting and get a nice sense of how\
      \ it all applies to the game right away. Like if you can make a simple script\
      \ that, when triggered the object will countdown from 6 and then blow up, then\
      \ you have a scripting tutorial that gives you some sense of relevance to the\
      \ game, you see?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I'm planning a \"Hello world\" aimed\
      \ at mappers that won't need sources to be set up etc. Is that what you mean?\
      \ But we're REALLY going off-topic now – see <a href=\"/Legacy:Mapping_Hello_World\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mapping Hello World\">Mapping Hello World</a>.</p>\n\n<!--\

      ==Instructions==\n\nTo create a space from scratch:\n# If you need to start\
      \ a fresh map, do [[Legacy:UnrealEd Main Menu|UnrealEd Main Menu]] -> File ->\
      \ New\n# \nThe [[Legacy:UnrealEd Interface|UnrealEd Interface]] has a set of\
      \ buttons running down the left side of the screen. This is called the [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]]\
      \ and is divided into several groups. In the 3rd group of buttons, find the\
      \ top-left button of that group is a blue-green cube. (In UnrealEd 2 and later,\
      \ each group can be collapsed, but normally this group is visible.) Right-click\
      \ the cube button.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface-Ed3-CubeBuilder.png|center|setting\
      \ the cube builder parameters]]\n\n\n# This opens a floating window with a list\
      \ of parameters for the '''Cube Brushbuilder'''. Type in the height, width and\
      \ breadth you want for the space. You can use the mouse to select the fields\
      \ or hit Tab to move the focus. The numbers are all in [[Legacy:Unreal Unit|Unreal\
      \ Unit]]s. We suggest:\n#* a room: 256x256x256\n#* a hall: 1024x1024x512\n#*\
      \ outside space: at least 4096x4096x2048, depending on what you want to put\
      \ in the area.\n#* keep in mind that an unreal pawn is rougly 198 units high.\n\
      #: For more on using the parameters window, see [[Legacy:Brushbuilders|Brushbuilders]].\n\
      # Press \"build\". The [[Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport|UnrealEd Viewport]]s should\
      \ now show a red cube (in dotted red lines in versions earlier than UnrealEd\
      \ 3).\n#: This step forges the [[Legacy:Red Builder Brush|red builder brush]].\
      \ It's a special object, which acts like a sort of 3D cursor or template (there's\
      \ more than one way to visualize it). You should now see it as a red cube in\
      \ the 3D viewport. To pan around the viewports, click the left mouse button\
      \ in the viewing area and drag; for more on this see [[Legacy:Camera Movement|Camera\
      \ Movement]].\n# \nFind the 4th group of buttons in the [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]].\
      \ The top-right one's tooltip says \"subtract\". click it. A hollow space appears\
      \ in the 3d viewport.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface-Ed3-Subtract.png|center|subtracting\
      \ a space]]\n\n\n\n==In more depth==\n\nThis action has taken the current shape\
      \ of the red builder brush, and used it as a template to create a real, subtractive\
      \ [[Legacy:Brush|brush]] in the world.\n\nThe other brushbuilder buttons create\
      \ different basic shapes, for example the cylinder brushbuilder will create\
      \ a circular room. Complete reference for these tools: [[Legacy:Brushbuilders|Brushbuilders]].\n\

      \ mirrored on both [[Legacy:Create A Room|Create a Room]] and [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Functional\
      \ Map]] I would like to update it so it contains more information which relates\
      \ specifically to subtraction, and remove the parts about creating a room. Before\
      \ doing so I would track down all links to this page and update them so they\
      \ are in the proper context. For instance, if I said \"Subtract a Space from\
      \ your Added Space\" and linked here, they would get a tutorial on how to build\
      \ a room, which is not quite right. Subtract a Space is an \"Element\" of the\
      \ \"Process\" Create a Room. I realize this is a longstanding argument on this\
      \ WIKI. If you disagree with my logic, Tarquin, simply delete my comment here\
      \ and I will take that as a \"No way\". Otherwise I will proceed with this simple\
      \ restructuring in a few days\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Well I don't really understand\
      \ what is happening here. [[Legacy:Mapping Lessons/Functional Map|Mapping Lessons/Functional\
      \ Map]] seems fairly pointless. This page seems fairly specific to the subtracting\
      \ action. Not sure what  [[Legacy:Create A Room|Create a Room]] is for, since\
      \ the point was to give a sequence of relatively small [[Legacy:Mapping Lessons|Mapping\
      \ Lessons]] pages that work together. The way I planned it, this page works\
      \ double: a) a basic procedure and b) a step of the Lessons. Maybe the Lessons\
      \ sequence needs a page to come BEFORE this one, what do you think? \n\n'''Musicalglass:'''\
      \ Well, although I agree with the the basic concept of having reusable bit's\
      \ of info, and I can relate to experienced programmer's impatience with wordy\
      \ procedures and agree with the cut to the chase style of describing procedures\
      \ on the Wiki, I think throwing people right into that is a little hard on beginners.\
      \ I try to keep in mind the posibilty of the 10 year old who is primarily a\
      \ gamer and the extent of his computer knowledge may be using AOL or something.\
      \ I think there should be at least one tutorial sequence which is written in\
      \ plain understandable language which familiarizes you with all the basic tools.\
      \ From there when you move on to the more advanced pages written in Wiki style,\
      \ it all makes more sense because now you're familiar with the terminology.\
      \ When I first started trying to learn Unreal I found the whole jumping around\
      \ from link to link thing very disorienting as each new page went off in another\
      \ myriad of directions and you quickly lost any sense of a comprehensive chain.\
      \ All I wanted was a simple beginner's tutorial which walked you through all\
      \ the basic tools and told you how to deal with any problems or misunderstandings\
      \ that might arise. But what I got was pages that were part of another incomplete\
      \ chain than what pertained to my specific question or that assumed that you\
      \ had already memorized one of the the other pages, which also went off in it's\
      \ own direction. I'm not sure what's up with Functional Map either. You can't\
      \ use it in a sentence for one thing. Seems to be in a folder and can't be linked\
      \ from all parts of the Wiki without a prefix, is that right?  I appreciate\
      \ someone's efforts to ridgidly adhere to this Wiki language style, but I think\
      \ it's not graphic enough and makes more sense to those who are already familiar\
      \ with the application. Here's my line of thinking: put yourself in the shoes\
      \ of some kid who just discovered he can make his own levels for Unreal. What's\
      \ the first thing he wants to do? Get into the game. So clearly any begginer's\
      \ tutorial should cover building a room. By that time you've already familiarized\
      \ yourself with the basic concept of subtracting a space and now a separate\
      \ page is uneeded, unless you have a different question pertaining to subtraction\
      \ like, \"why don't the textures appear on the outside of My subtracted spaces?\"\
      \ etc. So if I were to come here, I would want to find everything there is to\
      \ know about subtraction. Same with placing a light. Already learned it in the\
      \ beginner's tute, but if I need more info, go to Place a Light, see? You've\
      \ got to look at each \"Element\" page and ask yourself if it works in all possible\
      \ contexts where someone might refer to it.\n\nAlso I'm kind of pushing for\
      \ having two distinct chains of the same info; one is the light version which\
      \ shows you the simplest possible method to do one thing, (Mapping Lessons,\
      \ suggest rename to Beginners Guide) and then a second chain which details the\
      \ 6 different ways you can do this or that and covers each topic in detail.\
      \ What is currently Beginners Guide to Mapping is turned into an index page\
      \ just like mapping lessons and broken up into chapters; Texturing, Lighting,\
      \ etc. and is the encyclopedia of everything we know on the subject. Call that\
      \ Complete Guide to Mapping\n\n'''Tarquin:''' About half of the ''whole wiki''\
      \ is the \"Complete Guide to Mapping\". When you say \"6 different ways you\
      \ can do this or that\" do you mean the sort of bullet lists you get on [[Legacy:Actor\
      \ Properties Window|Actor Properties Window]]? Just read the first bullet and\
      \ ignore the rest ;) I'll have a look at Mapping Lessons this week and see if\
      \ I can clean it up.\n\n'''Musicalglass:''' Yup, pretty much.\n\nI pondered\
      \ the absurdity of my proposition for a couple days, looked over the existing\
      \ data there is to work with and, yeah about 75% of the Wiki would end up under\
      \ this topic. I made a rough draft for your consideration: The [[Legacy:Complete\
      \ Guide To Unreal Editor|Complete Guide to Unreal Editor]]. I'm not going to\
      \ dive into this ambitious project for a bit, and it needs to go through the\
      \ regular discussion phase. I'm currently working on my update to [[Legacy:Playing\
      \ Mesh Animations|Playing Mesh Animations]]. \n\nAs far as my personal level\
      \ of development, I would really, really like to see you guys update the entire\
      \ scripting section into something readable from the standpoint of someone who\
      \ has little or no knowledge of Java or C+. HelloWorld is simple and to the\
      \ point, but the pages before that that tell you how to get set up for scripting\
      \ are too technical. The prerequisite for doing HelloWorld tells me to decompile\
      \ all the source code. I don't need to do that to make my first script. There's\
      \ 4 highly technical pages about scripting before you get to your first simple\
      \ lesson. I think someone can do a My First Script tutorial for Mapping Lessons\
      \ which walks you through the procedure of getting set up and compiling the\
      \ HelloWorld script in fairly straightforward language assuming no knowledge\
      \ of what a command prompt is or anything obvious to a programmer. Then we need\
      \ some pages of short practical working examples of Unreal Script. Most of the\
      \ scripting pages assume prior knowledge of programming and the examples are\
      \ abstracts dealing with pizzas and anchovies but no simple examples of dealing\
      \ with ammo counts and firing rates, etc.\n\nSomeone needs to make a Scripting\
      \ Basics tutorial which assumes no knowledge of programming. Somebody could\
      \ just take one of those books of beginning  C+ and plagerize it essentially,\
      \ translating everything into unreal script. Start by explaining what variables\
      \ are and show you how to declare variables in unreal script and then go on\
      \ to show you how to actually do things with them with a bunch of simple code\
      \ snippets: To take the Ammo count and add 1 to it, do this, to make it so every\
      \ time you get shot your health is reduced by 50% do that. To make it so the\
      \ door won't open till you hit it 3 times do this. You see? Then beginner's\
      \ can take better advantage of the wealth of existing scripting information\
      \ available here. In my new tutorial: [[Legacy:Playing Mesh Animations|Playing\
      \ Mesh Animations]], near the bottom I have explored the possibility of taking\
      \ simple translational values and manipulating them with unreal script, using\
      \ the rotation of a simple mesh cube. I would like to extend that into Scripting\
      \ for Beginners so you can take the visual feedback of a moving object and do\
      \ various things with it using script: like using different states to change\
      \ the movement and so forth. That way beginners can learn scripting and get\
      \ a nice sense of how it all applies to the game right away. Like if you can\
      \ make a simple script that, when triggered the object will countdown from 6\
      \ and then blow up, then you have a scripting tutorial that gives you some sense\
      \ of relevance to the game, you see?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'm planning a \"Hello\
      \ world\" aimed at mappers that won't need sources to be set up etc. Is that\
      \ what you mean? But we're REALLY going off-topic now &ndash; see [[Legacy:Mapping\
      \ Hello World|Mapping Hello World]].\n\n[[Category:Legacy Basic Procedure|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n\
