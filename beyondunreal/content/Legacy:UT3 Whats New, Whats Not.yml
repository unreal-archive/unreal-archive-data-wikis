      <p>There is a small bug that appears if you minimize the window with the generic\
      \ browser open. When you switch back to the editor only the generic browser\
      \ will come back and once you close it the editor will not be there. That is\
      \ ok as the editor is still minimized. When we bring it up again it comes back,\
      \ but the generic browser still appears to be open, but can not be selected\
      \ or closed. The bug here is that the screen is not being refreshed properly,\
      \ so we just simply need to reopen the generic browser and close it again.</p>\n\
