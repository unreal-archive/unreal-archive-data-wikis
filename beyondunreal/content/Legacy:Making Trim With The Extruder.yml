      \ subtractive cube brush. Adding another cube with half the dimensions will\
      \ create a raised area in one corner. We're going to add trim around the edge.\
      \ Suppose the large room is 256x256x256 (although the height doesn't matter),\
      \ and the shelf area is 128x128x128. A corner of the small brush is on a corner\
      \ of the large one.</p>\n<p>The quick &amp; simple way to add trim to this shelf\
      \ would be to whip up two brushes, 256 long with a square cross-section of 32.\
      \ However, for the sake of illustration we're going to do something a little\
      \ more complicated. (If this is \"more complicated\" why should we learn how\
      \ to do it? Common sense says simpler things work better.)</p>\n<h4><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport\">UnrealEd Viewport</a>. Suppose the shelf\
      \ occupies the lower left corner of the room. The path needs 3 points, and it\
      \ needs to go right, then down. The simplest way to describe this shape is:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>[0] ( 0, 0, 0 )</li>\n<li>[1] ( 1, 0, 0 )</li>\n<li>[2] ( 1, 1, 0\
      \ )</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unreal uses a left-handed\
      \ coordinate system, so the positive y-axis goes down in top view.</li>\n<li>The\
      \ cordinates of the path are in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Red_Builder_Brush\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Red Builder Brush\">red builder brush</a>'s personal system. In other\
      \ words, they're relative to where the RBB is placed in the world. (okay, that\
      \ needs a rewrite for clarity)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The path coordinates are nice,\
      \ simple numbers, that can be scaled to any size with the <i>PathFactor</i>\
      \ property. An easy way to work with this is to set the grid to the same size\
      \ as the value of PathFactor and then count grid squares. Here, set PathFactor\
      \ to 128.</p>\n<p>Just to confuse: with the relative paths option, describing\
      \ a path with vectors is even simpler. Each vector is how far to travel from\
      \ the previous point. The path in relative vectors is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[0] (\
      \ 0, 0, 0 )r</li>\n<li>[1] ( 1, 0, 0 )r</li>\n<li>[2] ( 0, 1, 0 )r</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>The <i>PathSource</i> property tells the Extruder which method you're using\
      \ to describe the path.</p>\n<p>Try either method, press build, and line up\
      \ the RBB to the correct spot and add it to the world. The texture may need\
      \ to be rotated, depending on whether the trim texture you've selected is horizontal\
      \ or vertical. If this is the case, select any of the trim brush's surfaces,\
      \ press SHIFT+B and rotate them by 90 degrees. (related reading: <a href=\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Suppose now that we want to add trim that goes around\
      \ the base of the shelf. We could use the same brush and obtain a surface that's\
      \ flush with the main wall. Alternatively, we might want a brush that protrudes\
      \ like a step, or a brush embedded in the floor. The current shape of the RBB\
      \ is too short at each end to do this.</p>\n<p>We could simply use <a href=\"\

      \ be fine for a simple piece of trim like this, and the second method is fiddly\
      \ because with the current PathFactor we'd need to type in fractions. Far too\
      \ much work.</p>\n<p>Instead, we're going to keep the path exactly as it is:\
      \ it follows the edge of the shelf so from an esthetical point of view it makes\
      \ sense not to change it. We're going to change the shape instead. Position\
      \ the camera in the 3D viewport so you're level with the RBB and looking at\
      \ the first path point. In the Top view the camera icon will be to the immediate\
      \ left of the RBB. You'll see a red cross, the <a href=\"/Legacy:Pivot\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Pivot\">pivot</a> point, in the upper left corner of the end face of\
      \ the brush. The pivot point corresponds to (0,0,0) in the shape co-ordinates.</p>\n\
      <p>This is where it gets technical. The square that make the end face of the\
      \ brush is the Extruder's initial Shape. It's been tilted by 90 degrees because\
      \ the first path segment travels along the x-axis and not straight up. If you\
      \ find this next section totally confusing, reset the path points to (0, 0,\
      \ 0), (0, 0, 1) and it will be easier to see what is happening.</p>\n<p>We want\
      \ the shape to move from its current position 1 unit to the left, so the pivot\
      \ point is in the upper right corner. As we're using the preset system to make\
      \ the shape, we can tell it to do that very simply. The <i>PresetMetrics</i>\
      \ array gives the presets module of the Extruder extra information about the\
      \ shape we want.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first pair of values gives the width &amp;\
      \ height of the square. They're currently zero, which tells the module to use\
      \ default values.</li>\n<li>The second pair of values gives the offset of the\
      \ shape; in other words the 2-dimensional coordinates of the top left corner\
      \ of the square in Shape-space. Confused? Try setting PresetMetrics[2] to 1\
      \ and press Build. The pivot cross stays in the same place, but the rest of\
      \ the brush has moved down by 32 world units.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now set [2] back\
      \ to 0, and set [3] to -1. The brush moves back up and to the left. Looking\
      \ in Top view, you can by selecting the added trim brush and the RBB in turn\
      \ that their pivot point is in the same place: this is because they have the\
      \ same path.</p>\n<p>All we've essentially done is told the Extruder attach\
      \ the shape to the path at a different point.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

    text: "The [[Legacy:Extruder Brushbuilder|Extruder Brushbuilder]] can be used\
      \ to make segmented trim brushes. This tutorial assumes that you're vaguely\
      \ familiar with the concept of the Extruder brushbuilder. See the [[Legacy:Architecture|Architecture]]\
      \ topic page for more on trim.\n\n(BTW peeps, this tutorial I'm sure will confuse\
      \ all but the l33test of quaternion-jedi, so please feel free to edit. Yes,\
      \ I'll add pics later but today I'm in Grouch-mode so I'm currently inclined\
      \ to say \"if you can't visualise in 3D go and edit for Tetris\")\n\n==Simple\
      \ corners ==\n\nLet's suppose we have a square room created by a large subtractive\
      \ cube brush. Adding another cube with half the dimensions will create a raised\
      \ area in one corner. We're going to add trim around the edge. Suppose the large\
      \ room is 256x256x256 (although the height doesn't matter), and the shelf area\
      \ is 128x128x128. A corner of the small brush is on a corner of the large one.\n\
      \nThe quick & simple way to add trim to this shelf would be to whip up two brushes,\
      \ 256 long with a square cross-section of 32. However, for the sake of illustration\
      \ we're going to do something a little more complicated. (If this is \"more\
      \ complicated\" why should we learn how to do it? Common sense says simpler\
      \ things work better.)\n\n====Shape ====\n\nLeave the ''ShapeSource'' property\
      \ set to \"SO_pSquare\" (the preset square). This builds a square of side 1\
      \ in the Extruder's ShapePoints array, so set the ''ShapeFactor'' property to\
      \ multiply it up to the size of trim that we want: in this example, that's 32.\n\
      \n====Path ====\n\nWe'll be working with the path in Top view, so \"up\" & \"\
      left\" refer to directions in that orthogonal [[Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport|UnrealEd\
      \ Viewport]]. Suppose the shelf occupies the lower left corner of the room.\
      \ The path needs 3 points, and it needs to go right, then down. The simplest\
      \ way to describe this shape is:\n*[0] ( 0, 0, 0 )\n*[1] ( 1, 0, 0 )\n*[2] (\
      \ 1, 1, 0 )\n\nThings to remember: \n* Unreal uses a left-handed coordinate\
      \ system, so the positive y-axis goes down in top view.\n* The cordinates of\
      \ the path are in the [[Legacy:Red Builder Brush|red builder brush]]'s personal\
      \ system. In other words, they're relative to where the RBB is placed in the\
      \ world. (okay, that needs a rewrite for clarity)\n\nThe path coordinates are\
      \ nice, simple numbers, that can be scaled to any size with the ''PathFactor''\
      \ property. An easy way to work with this is to set the grid to the same size\
      \ as the value of PathFactor and then count grid squares. Here, set PathFactor\
      \ to 128.\n\nJust to confuse: with the relative paths option, describing a path\
      \ with vectors is even simpler. Each vector is how far to travel from the previous\
      \ point. The path in relative vectors is:\n*[0] ( 0, 0, 0 )r\n*[1] ( 1, 0, 0\
      \ )r\n*[2] ( 0, 1, 0 )r\n\nThe ''PathSource'' property tells the Extruder which\
      \ method you're using to describe the path.\n\nTry either method, press build,\
      \ and line up the RBB to the correct spot and add it to the world. The texture\
      \ may need to be rotated, depending on whether the trim texture you've selected\
      \ is horizontal or vertical. If this is the case, select any of the trim brush's\
      \ surfaces, press SHIFT+B and rotate them by 90 degrees. (related reading: [[Legacy:Selecting\
      \ Surfaces|Selecting Surfaces]] and [[Legacy:Surface Properties Window|Surface\
      \ Properties Window]]).\n\n==External Corner ==\n\nSuppose now that we want\
      \ to add trim that goes around the base of the shelf. We could use the same\
      \ brush and obtain a surface that's flush with the main wall. Alternatively,\
      \ we might want a brush that protrudes like a step, or a brush embedded in the\
      \ floor. The current shape of the RBB is too short at each end to do this.\n\
      \nWe could simply use [[Legacy:Vertex Editing|vertex editing]] or [[Legacy:Face\
      \ Drag|face drag]] on each end, or we could fiddle with the path points. The\
      \ first method would be fine for a simple piece of trim like this, and the second\
      \ method is fiddly because with the current PathFactor we'd need to type in\
      \ fractions. Far too much work.\n\nInstead, we're going to keep the path exactly\

      \ in the upper left corner of the end face of the brush. The pivot point corresponds\
      \ to (0,0,0) in the shape co-ordinates.\n\nThis is where it gets technical.\
      \ The square that make the end face of the brush is the Extruder's initial Shape.\
      \ It's been tilted by 90 degrees because the first path segment travels along\
      \ the x-axis and not straight up. If you find this next section totally confusing,\
      \ reset the path points to (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1) and it will be easier to see\
      \ what is happening.\n\nWe want the shape to move from its current position\
      \ 1 unit to the left, so the pivot point is in the upper right corner. As we're\
      \ using the preset system to make the shape, we can tell it to do that very\
      \ simply. The ''PresetMetrics'' array gives the presets module of the Extruder\

      \ corner of the square in Shape-space. Confused? Try setting PresetMetrics[2]\
      \ to 1 and press Build. The pivot cross stays in the same place, but the rest\
      \ of the brush has moved down by 32 world units.\n\nNow set [2] back to 0, and\
      \ set [3] to -1. The brush moves back up and to the left. Looking in Top view,\
      \ you can by selecting the added trim brush and the RBB in turn that their pivot\
      \ point is in the same place: this is because they have the same path. \n\n\
      All we've essentially done is told the Extruder attach the shape to the path\
      \ at a different point.\n\n==45 degree turns ==\n\nNow let's make the shape\
      \ we're trimming a little more complex. Either delete both trim brushes, or\
      \ make another room in the world by duplicating the two cubes and rebuilding.\n\
      \nUse [[Legacy:Brush Clipping|brush clipping]] to slice off a piece of the additive\
      \ brush: cut diagonally across the corner that's in the center of the room &ndash;\
      \ ie place a clip marker halfway along the top side and right side.\n\nTo trim\
      \ this new shape, we need to follow its edge with the path as before. We'll\
      \ need 4 points this time. If we work with the same scale the second point will\
      \ be (0.5,0,0) so to simplify the points, change the PathFactor and the Grid\

      \ 1, 0, 0 )\n* [2] ( 2, 1, 0 )\n* [3] ( 2, 2, 0 )\n\nNote that these are absolute,\
