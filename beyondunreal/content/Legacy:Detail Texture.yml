      <p>A detail texture is a very small, fine pattern which is faded in as you approach\
      \ a surface, for example wood grain, or imperfections in stone. When you import\
      \ a detail texture, you need to set its Scale value to a small number (typically\
      \ 0.25nm) to specify its scaling relative to whatever texture it applies to.</p>\n\
      <p>Detail textures and macrotextures modulate (multiply) the surface they're\
      \ applied to. By modulating, they have the ability to scale the surface's brightness\
      \ up or down. Colors with RGB brightness values from 0-127 darken the surface;\
      \ 128 has no effect; and 129-255 brighten the surface. Therefore, when drawing\
      \ microtextures and macrotextures, it is important that you design them with\
      \ their brightnesses in the proper range so they affect surfaces naturally.\
      \ If a detail texture's average brightness deviates too far from 128, then surfaces\
      \ will appear to brighten or darken as you approach them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\

      \ by a 128 brightness detail texture, while dark textures are brightened up\
      \ a bit. I then converted the original texture to greyscale to determine the\
      \ average brightness, and adapted my detail textures to that. Worked fine for\
      \ me, although I don't know if it's really true.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\n\
