      <p>Pathing is a necessary step before release of any custom map, and the better\
      \ the pathing is, the better the reviews your map will receive.</p>\n<p>Bots\
      \ navigate a map by moving through a network of <a href=\"/Legacy:NavigationPoint\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:NavigationPoint\">NavigationPoints</a>, the simplest of which\
      \ is called a <a href=\"/Legacy:PathNode\" title=\"Legacy:PathNode\">PathNode</a>.\
      \ When a bot wants to get somewhere, the game finds the node nearest his current\
      \ position and the node nearest his objective, calculates the shortest path\
      \ through the network from one to the other, and tells the bot to follow that\
      \ path. Thus, in order to get bots to play your map, you need to place enough\
      \ PathNodes for bots to be able to use them to get to anywhere they might need\
      \ to go.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Placing_Basic_PathNodes\"\
      >Placing Basic PathNodes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Placing Basic PathNodes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Simply right-click on the location where you want\
      \ to place a pathnode, and then select \"Place PathNode Here.\" Build up the\
      \ botpath network by placing more PathNodes at junctions and intersections where\
      \ you want your bots to be able to go. You'll need to <a href=\"/Legacy:Rebuild\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Rebuild\">Rebuild</a> your paths (use the Build Paths button\
      \ on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Toolbar\" title=\"Legacy:Toolbar\">Toolbar</a>) for\
      \ any changes you make to take effect. While you don't need to litter the map\
      \ with PathNodes, it's important to make sure of a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each\
      \ intersection or junction has a PathNode.</li>\n<li>Changes in elevation or\
      \ line-of-sight are marked with a PathNode. (such as the top and bottom of a\
      \ staircase)</li>\n<li>Long stretches between PathNodes are filled in with enough\
      \ nodes to link them together.</li>\n<li>Any tight hallway has a PathNode set\
      \ at either end, in the center of the entrance and exit.</li>\n<li>Lines-of-sight\
      \ between PathNodes are clear. (Imagine bots may travel in straight lines between\
      \ connected PathNodes)</li>\n<li>Various actors such as inventory items act\
      \ as pathnodes themselves, so there is no need to place a node right on top\
      \ of them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the tips section below for more info.</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ The Path Network\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>To see the path network you're building, right-click on the grey bar at the\
      \ top of the 3D viewport to bring up the <a href=\"/Legacy:Viewport_Context_Menu\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Viewport Context Menu\">Viewport Context Menu</a> and select\
      \ \"Show Paths\" under the view submenu.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"Buidling_The_Path_Network\">Buidling The Path Network</span><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Basic_Bot_Pathing?section=5\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Buidling The Path Network\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Be careful not to place too many; an excessive number\
      \ of nodes may slow your map down, and is likely to confuse bots. A good strategy\
      \ is to start with only the PathNodes you know you'll need. Then try to Build\
      \ Paths. If you get errors regarding \"orphaned\" or \"stranded\" nodes, you\
      \ can adjust them or add more to link them together. Add a few more and try\
      \ to Build Paths again. Little by little, you'll be adding only the PathNodes\
      \ necessary and limiting overkill. Too many pathnodes can slow the map down\
      \ and make the network overly complicated – your goal should be to cover all\
      \ of the map with the minimum of nodes.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      <ul>\n<li><b>Line of Sight</b> For a bot to be able to move from node to node,\
      \ the two nodes must be within a line-of-sight of one another, and not too far\
      \ apart. See \"Viewing the Path Network\" above.</li>\n<li><b>Distances</b>\
      \ See how far two nodes can be moved apart before the connection dissapears\
      \ to get a good esitmation of the maximum distance. A distance of 300 to 700\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:UU\" title=\"Legacy:UU\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UUs</a> seems\
      \ to work well. Place them closer together on uneven or broken ground and farther\
      \ apart on open floors. No farther then 300 to 350 on steps and ramps. The distance\
      \ must be at least 50<a href=\"/Legacy:UU\" title=\"Legacy:UU\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      >UU</a>, otherwise <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\">UnrealEd</a> will notify you that your paths are too close together\
      \ upon rebuild.</li>\n<li><b>No space to add nodes</b> If you ever select Add\
      \ PathNode and nothing appears, it means that there wasn't room to add it. Keep\
      \ trying in different spots nearby or momentarily turn off grid snap until it\
      \ works.</li>\n<li><b>Minimize the number of nodes</b> Don't forget that too\
      \ many NavigationPoints can slow the map down; the more nodes in the network,\
      \ the more time it takes to calculate a path through it. So don't go overboard.\
      \ Try to economize as much as possible.</li>\n<li><b>Bots like inventory items</b>.\
      \ MiniHealth pickups, for example, <i>can</i> be used as incentive to follow\
      \ a route. Remember that inventory items also act as pathnodes, whether they\
      \ are spawned or not, so there's no need to put a pathnode at the item. Keep\
      \ in mind that bots may go out of their way to collect them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See\
      \ also <a href=\"/Legacy:Inventory_Item_Placement\" title=\"Legacy:Inventory\
      \ Item Placement\">Inventory Item Placement</a> for how Inventory items should\
      \ best be added.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_NavigationPoints\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Once you've got the whole level covered with PathNodes,\
      \ you can begin to look for special points that need more than a basic PathNode\
      \ NavigationPoint. JumpSpots, for example, are points that are good destinations\
      \ from a jump. You would want to identify any PathNode near the edge of or at\
      \ the bottom of a ledge and replace it with a JumpSpot.</p>\n<p>Other types\
      \ of NavigationPoints such as <a href=\"/Legacy:PlayerStart\" title=\"Legacy:PlayerStart\"\
      >PlayerStarts</a>, <a href=\"/Legacy:FlagBase\" title=\"Legacy:FlagBase\">FlagBases</a>\
      \ in CTF maps, <a href=\"/Legacy:ControlPoint\" title=\"Legacy:ControlPoint\"\

      >Pickups</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:InventorySpot\" title=\"Legacy:InventorySpot\"\
      >InventorySpots</a> also act as nodes in the botpath network, so you don't need\
      \ to add PathNodes near those items.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While working on the bot support,\
      \ you will need to make sure the botplay is working. You will have to focus\
      \ on the bots as they try to play in the map. By spectating a bots-only game,\
      \ you can identify trouble spots or behaviors that you'd like to change.</p>\n\
      <p>Occasionally a bot can get \"stuck\" and moves from one node to another,\
      \ back and forth. The cause is related to the bot's current goal; a pickup,\
      \ a LiftExit, etc. For one reason or another, the bot believes the goal is reachable,\
      \ but it cannot reach it, so it turns back only to decide it should try and\
      \ reach it again. That behavior can continue on indefinately in some cases.\
      \ The are two possible solutions for this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Place another node\
      \ to allow the bot to reach their goal.</li>\n<li>Move things around a bit;\
      \ either the PathNodes or the bot's goal item.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See also <a href=\"\

    text: "This is an introductory tutorial on Basic Bot Pathing, aka Pathing.  To\
      \ better understand the concepts and elements of a bot path network, see [[Legacy:Bot\
      \ Pathing|Bot Pathing]].\n\n==Prerequisites==\n\nThis tutorial assumes you know\
      \ many of the [[:Category:Legacy Basic Procedure]]s: [[Legacy:Create A Room|Create\
      \ a Room]], [[Legacy:Add An Actor|Add an Actor]], [[Legacy:Set The Following\
      \ Properties|Set the following Properties]] and [[Legacy:Match These Tags|Match\
      \ these Tags]].  It assumes you have already been through many of the [[Legacy:Mapping\
      \ Lessons|Mapping Lessons]] and have a custom map of your own, ready to implement\
      \ [[Legacy:Bot Pathing|Bot Pathing]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nPathing is a necessary\
      \ step before release of any custom map, and the better the pathing is, the\
      \ better the reviews your map will receive.\n\nBots navigate a map by moving\
      \ through a network of [[Legacy:NavigationPoint|NavigationPoint]]s, the simplest\
      \ of which is called a [[Legacy:PathNode|PathNode]]. When a bot wants to get\
      \ somewhere, the game finds the node nearest his current position and the node\
      \ nearest his objective, calculates the shortest path through the network from\
      \ one to the other, and tells the bot to follow that path. Thus, in order to\
      \ get bots to play your map, you need to place enough PathNodes for bots to\
      \ be able to use them to get to anywhere they might need to go.\n\n==Placing\
      \ Basic PathNodes==\n\nSimply right-click on the location where you want to\
      \ place a pathnode, and then select \"Place PathNode Here.\"  Build up the botpath\
      \ network by placing more PathNodes at junctions and intersections where you\
      \ want your bots to be able to go.  You'll need to [[Legacy:Rebuild|Rebuild]]\
      \ your paths (use the Build Paths button on the [[Legacy:Toolbar|Toolbar]])\
      \ for any changes you make to take effect.  While you don't need to litter the\
      \ map with PathNodes, it's important to make sure of a few things:\n\n* Each\
      \ intersection or junction has a PathNode.\n* Changes in elevation or line-of-sight\
      \ are marked with a PathNode. (such as the top and bottom of a staircase)\n\
      * Long stretches between PathNodes are filled in with enough nodes to link them\
      \ together.\n* Any tight hallway has a PathNode set at either end, in the center\
      \ of the entrance and exit.\n* Lines-of-sight between PathNodes are clear. (Imagine\
      \ bots may travel in straight lines between connected PathNodes)\n* Various\
      \ actors such as inventory items act as pathnodes themselves, so there is no\
      \ need to place a node right on top of them.\n\nSee the tips section below for\
      \ more info.\n\n==Viewing The Path Network==\n\nTo see the path network you're\
      \ building, right-click on the grey bar at the top of the 3D viewport to bring\
      \ up the [[Legacy:Viewport Context Menu|Viewport Context Menu]] and select \"\
      Show Paths\" under the view submenu.\n\n==Buidling The Path Network==\n\nBe\
      \ careful not to place too many; an excessive number of nodes may slow your\
      \ map down, and is likely to confuse bots.  A good strategy is to start with\
      \ only the PathNodes you know you'll need.  Then try to Build Paths.  If you\
      \ get errors regarding \"orphaned\" or \"stranded\" nodes, you can adjust them\
      \ or add more to link them together.  Add a few more and try to Build Paths\
      \ again.  Little by little, you'll be adding only the PathNodes necessary and\
      \ limiting overkill.  Too many pathnodes can slow the map down and make the\
      \ network overly complicated &ndash; your goal should be to cover all of the\
      \ map with the minimum of nodes.\n\n===Tips===\n* '''Line of Sight''' For a\
      \ bot to be able to move from node to node, the two nodes must be within a line-of-sight\
      \ of one another, and not too far apart.  See \"Viewing the Path Network\" above.\
      \ \n* '''Distances'''  See how far two nodes can be moved apart before the connection\
      \ dissapears to get a good esitmation of the maximum distance.  A distance of\
      \ 300 to 700 [[Legacy:UU|UU]]s seems to work well. Place them closer together\
      \ on uneven or broken ground and farther apart on open floors. No farther then\
      \ 300 to 350 on steps and ramps. The distance must be at least 50[[Legacy:UU|UU]],\
      \ otherwise [[Legacy:UnrealEd|UnrealEd]] will notify you that your paths are\
      \ too close together upon rebuild.\n* '''No space to add nodes''' If you ever\
      \ select Add PathNode and nothing appears, it means that there wasn't room to\
      \ add it. Keep trying in different spots nearby or momentarily turn off grid\
      \ snap until it works.\n* '''Minimize the number of nodes''' Don't forget that\
      \ too many NavigationPoints can slow the map down; the more nodes in the network,\
      \ the more time it takes to calculate a path through it. So don't go overboard.\
      \  Try to economize as much as possible.\n* '''Bots like inventory items'''.\
      \  MiniHealth pickups, for example, ''can'' be used as incentive to follow a\
      \ route.  Remember that inventory items also act as pathnodes, whether they\
      \ are spawned or not, so there's no need to put a pathnode at the item. Keep\
      \ in mind that bots may go out of their way to collect them.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Inventory\
      \ Item Placement|Inventory Item Placement]] for how Inventory items should best\
      \ be added.\n\n==Other NavigationPoints==\n\nOnce you've got the whole level\
      \ covered with PathNodes, you can begin to look for special points that need\
      \ more than a basic PathNode NavigationPoint.  JumpSpots, for example, are points\
      \ that are good destinations from a jump.  You would want to identify any PathNode\
      \ near the edge of or at the bottom of a ledge and replace it with a JumpSpot.\n\
      \nOther types of NavigationPoints such as [[Legacy:PlayerStart|PlayerStart]]s,\
      \ [[Legacy:FlagBase|FlagBase]]s in CTF maps, [[Legacy:ControlPoint|ControlPoint]]s\
      \ in Domination maps, [[Legacy:Pickup|Pickup]]s and [[Legacy:InventorySpot|InventorySpot]]s\
      \ also act as nodes in the botpath network, so you don't need to add PathNodes\
      \ near those items.\n\n===Placing Other NavigationPoint actors===\n\nBring up\
      \ the [[Legacy:Actor Browser|Actor Browser]], select the type of NavigationPoint\
      \ you wish.  In the 3D view, place a node by right-clicking on the floor and\
      \ selecting the \"Place <YourActor> Here\" option.\n\nWhen it's time to handle\
      \ the more advanced bot behaviors such as riding lifts, using jump pads, ImpactJumping,\
      \ Translocator use, etc., here are some specific pages to look over:\n* [[Legacy:Bot\
      \ Pathing|Bot Pathing]] &ndash; Concepts and elements of a bot path network.\n\
      ** [[Legacy:Pathing Lifts|Pathing Lifts]]\n** [[Legacy:Pathing Kickers|Pathing\
      \ Kickers]]\n** [[Legacy:Pathing Translocators|Pathing Translocators]]\n** [[Legacy:Pathing\
      \ For Vehicles|Pathing For Vehicles]]\n** [[Legacy:Pathing 2k4 Flying Vehicles|Pathing\
      \ 2k4 Flying Vehicles]]\n* The full list of available [[Legacy:NavigationPoint|NavigationPoint]]s\n\
      * [[Legacy:Strategic Bots|Strategic Bots]] &ndash; Advanced bot support.\n\n\
      ==Testing & Troubleshooting==\n\nWhile working on the bot support, you will\
      \ need to make sure the botplay is working.  You will have to focus on the bots\
      \ as they try to play in the map.  By spectating a bots-only game, you can identify\
      \ trouble spots or behaviors that you'd like to change.\n\nOccasionally a bot\
      \ can get \"stuck\" and moves from one node to another, back and forth.  The\
      \ cause is related to the bot's current goal; a pickup, a LiftExit, etc.  For\
      \ one reason or another, the bot believes the goal is reachable, but it cannot\
      \ reach it, so it turns back only to decide it should try and reach it again.\
      \  That behavior can continue on indefinately in some cases.  The are two possible\
      \ solutions for this:\n# Place another node to allow the bot to reach their\
      \ goal.\n# Move things around a bit; either the PathNodes or the bot's goal\
      \ item.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Bot Mind|Bot Mind]] and [[Legacy:Testing Botplay|Testing\
      \ Botplay]] for more on troubleshooting and how to determine what the bot's\
      \ goals are.\n\n==External Links ==\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20060504134611/http://www.planetunreal.com/nucleus/UED2_pathing.html\
