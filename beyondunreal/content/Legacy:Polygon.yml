      \ subject for a while. In modeling, a polygon refers to a 3-sided surface that\
      \ makes up part of the model. In UnrealEd, it's sometimes refered to as some\
      \ convex thingy? And sometimes just a surface?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> As a\
      \ term, \"polygon\" implies that it can have more than three sides. For that\
      \ matter, I had thought even in modeling the correct term for what you're describing\
      \ was \"face\" (or perhaps even \"triangle\"). – In UnrealEd, a polygon must\
      \ be planar and convex, but it can have any number of sides.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ Mmm... 3D modeling programs these days seem to mostly support only 3 sided\
      \ polygons unfortunately. Rhino supports any number of sides, but this can cause\
      \ havok if you try to export to another program. The confusion is certainately\
      \ understandable.</p>\n<p><b>RDGDanClark:</b> As far as I know, any 3D modelling\
      \ program will support polygons with any number of sides, but this is just not\
      \ optimal for performance. Rendering applications like the 3D objects to be\
      \ triangulated, i.e. divided up into triangles.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Well,\
      \ the programs can usually make polygons with any number of sides but I don't\
      \ think they can usually export to a common format like that. In my experience\
      \ anyway, exporting to DXF, LWO, or 3DS always seems to trianglify the mesh\
      \ \"for me\" against my will.&#160;:P</p>\n<p><b>Sobiwan:</b> This conversation\
