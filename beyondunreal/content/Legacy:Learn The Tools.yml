      \ some of one and some of the other, and before you know it you're doing it!&#160;:)\
      \ As this is intended to be a beginner's tutorial, we will assume you know nothing,\
      \ we will try to use language a 10 year old can understand, and we are not afraid\

      \ Your Builder Brush should turn a bright red indicating that it is selected\
      \ and you can drag it around in the window. Move it up a bit. Now click in the\

      <p>Click the little joystick icon in the top left corner of the Perspective\

      \ in the other windows if you like. Drag it around a bit in the Top window.\
      \ Note how each time you select a new window the border turns white indicating\

      \ in the top left of your toolbox: [[Image:Legacy_button.mode.scale.gif|]] (If\
      \ you hold your mouse over it, it should say Actor Scaling). It becomes highlighted\
      \ and your cursor changes to a midievil cross. Hold the Ctrl key and left drag\
      \ slowly left and right in one of the orthogonal Viewports the Red Builder Brush\
      \ scales in one axis. Now Ctrl right drag. It scales in a different axis. Do\
      \ the same in the two other orthogonal views. Note how each window shares one\
      \ scaling axes with one window and one axis with the other. I won't elaborate\
      \ on which window does what axis. Just play around a bit till you get a feel\
      \ for the scaling thing. If you accidentally scale in the wrong direction, just\
      \ hit Ctrl Z to undo. You can hold both mouse buttons at the same time and scale\
      \ two axis at once.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rotate\">Rotate</span><span\

      \ to the right of the Actor Scaling button, click the Actor Rotate button. [[Image:Legacy_button.mode.rotate.gif|]]\
      \ Ctrl left drag in any of the viewports and your Builder Brush will rotate\
      \ in 1 axis relative to the window view. Ctrl right drag and it rotates in a\
      \ second axis. With it rotated a bit off from 90 degrees, go back to the scale\
      \ button and try scaling. Note how it flattens out relative to the camera view,\
      \ not the object itself, so now instead of a cube, we have like a rhomboid shaped\

      <p>OK, so now you got your Brush rotated and scaled and you want to move it\
      \ around a bit like before, so you remember how to do that, right? You just\
      \ Ctrl left drag in one of the windows and... OOPS! We're still in rotate mode!\
      \ Must be the button undernerneath Actor Scaling with the T in it, right? Sorry,\
      \ if you hold your mouse over the button, it says that's for moving textures.\
      \ You can hold your mouse over every button on the interface and there's not\
      \ a move tool to be found.&#160;?????? Well, in their magnanimous effort to\
      \ do everything different, Epic has cleverly disguised the traditional cursor\
      \ button that everybody in the world is familiar with as a camera. Go figure.</p>\n\

      <p>Now go back and left click on your Cube Builder button like you're going\
      \ to build a new cube. Does it create a new cube? Surprise! No, it resets the\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>OK let's Add a Space. If you've already done the <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Create_A_Room\" title=\"Legacy:Create A Room\">Create a Room</a>\
      \ tutorial, by now you should know how to <a href=\"/Legacy:Subtract_A_Space\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Subtract A Space\">Subtract a Space</a>, so you should pretty\
      \ much intuitively know where to find the Add a Space button, right? But just\
      \ in case, since this is a beginner's tutorial, let me refresh your memory.</p>\n\
      <p>[[Image:Legacy_AddSub5.jpeg|]]</p>\n<p>OK so you got your Builder Brush and\
      \ you click Add and you should see the default texture appear. Whoops! nothing\
      \ happened. Click it again. Nope. Click it a little harder and longer. Sorry.\
      \ Oh that's right, I bet you forgot to Build All like in the Create a Room tutorial,\
      \ right? Just to be different, this time instead of clicking on the Build All\
      \ button, go to the menu bar at the very top and select Build -&gt; Build all.\
      \ Still no cube. Maybe we forgot to enter the proper size dimensions, so right\
      \ click on the Cube Builder button and let's enter some new values of 512, 512\
      \ and 512. Click the Build button and close the window and... HEY! What's that\
      \ blue thing? The Builder brush obviously made something so why isn't it showing\
      \ up in the scene? Not only that but if you carefully click on the edge of the\
      \ blue box to select it, then hold the Ctrl key and left drag, you will see\
      \ that it separates from another one underneath and maybe yet another depending\
      \ on how many times you clicked the Add button. So where's our cube? You remember\
      \ in the previous tutorial Create a Room, we had you Subtract a Space before\
      \ anything else? That is because this is the fundamental building block of everything\
      \ you can place in the visible Unreal world.</p>\n<p><i><b>You can not add solid\
      \ geometry into your Map unless you first place it into a Subtracted Space.</b></i></p>\n\
      <p>In much the same way that in the real world you can't put a human into space\
      \ without being in some type of container, in the Unreal world everything must\
      \ be in a container, or Subtracted Space to be visible. Nuff said?</p>\n<h3><span\

      <p>And you know what? If you just take the 512 Builder Brush you just made and\
      \ subtract it out around your added space you ain't gonna get nothin buddy.\
      \ Sorry to mislead you. We're just going to have to go back and do it all over\
      \ again. So therefore...</p>\n<p>Do File -&gt; New</p>\n<p>Subtract a Large\
      \ Space - Right click on the Cube Builder button and ensure that the values\
      \ are set to 512 and click Build. Click on the Subtract button..</p>\n<p>Now\
      \ enter new values of 256, click Build and close the window.</p>\n<p>Click on\
      \ the Add button. Voila! That wasn't so hard now, was it?</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
      mw-headline\" id=\"Build_All.3F\">Build All?</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\
      ><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Learn_The_Tools?section=11\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Build All?\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At this point we're just about at the point where\
      \ we were in the previous Create a Room tutorial, only now we've got a room\
      \ with an added space in it and we're just about ready to play our Map, right?\
      \ So let's click the Build All button. (The one at the top that looks like a\
      \ cube with a lightbulb next to it, remember? Sorry folks, this is a beginner's\
      \ tutorial.) And BANG! everything suddenly disappears in the Perspective window.\
      \ What happened to our room? I'm not leading you on another wild goose chase\
      \ am I? Actually yes and no. At the top of the Perspective window is some buttons\
      \ which look like various cubes. If you hold your mouse over them you can see\
      \ that they represent different methods of rendering the viewport such as Wireframe,\
      \ etc. About the 4th one over, click on the one that says Textured. Now you\
      \ can see that your room is indeed still there. When we clicked the Build All\
      \ button, we just rendered the scene and forgot to add a light first. If you\
      \ go a couple buttons over and switch back to Dynamic Light, you will notice\
      \ that you can't see the grid lines through the cube any longer. We have just\
      \ created a pitch black room.</p>\n<p>And of course you realize if we added\
      \ a light now and clicked Build all, then went to play our map, you would get\
      \ an error if we didn't add a PlayerStart first. The game needs to know where\
      \ to spawn a player into the scene. So go ahead and add those now as we're going\
      \ to continue the tutorial from here.. You might want to switch over from Dynamic\
      \ Light back to Textured for a moment so you can see what you're doing as there\
      \ is currently no light in the scene.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>So to reiterrate:</p>\n<p>You pretty much have to\
      \ do all the steps in the Create a Room tutorial;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Subtract a\
      \ Space</li>\n<li>Add a Light</li>\n<li>Add a Playerstart</li>\n</ol>\n<p>before\
      \ you can play your map in the Unreal game.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Change the Texture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>OK so you should have a 512 subtracted room with a\
      \ 256 added cube in it. It might be kind of hard to distinguish the added space\
      \ because it has the same texture as the subtracted space, so let's change the\
      \ texture to a contrasting color. First left click one of the surfaces of your\
      \ added cube. It should turn a blueish color indicating it's selected. Now open\
      \ the Texture Browser - Click on the button in the top toolbar that looks like\
      \ a Landscape Painting. The Texture Browser opens.</p>\n<p>Now in the Texture\
      \ Browser window. Go to File -&gt; Open. You should be taken to Unreal's default\
      \ texture folder with a list of Texture Packages. Let's open Alleria Terrain.\
      \ Select any of the textures which appear on the list and it should be immediately\
      \ applied to the selected surface of your cube. Select a different surface and\
      \ click on a different texture. BANG there it is. Simple, huh? Now hold the\
      \ Ctrl key and click on multiple surfaces to group select. If you accidentaly\
      \ clicked one you didn't want simply Ctrl click a second time to deselect it.</p>\n\
      <p>Let's say we want to apply textures to all the walls but not the floor and\
      \ ceiling. First select one surface. Now press Shift B and all the surfaces\
      \ become selected.. Now hold Ctrl and deselect the floor and ceiling. Click\
      \ on a new Texture and there you are. Easy!</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      <p>OK enough using the same textures everybody else is using. Let's jump straight\
      \ into creating our own, shall we?</p>\n<p>Open your favorite graphics app,\
      \ Photoshop, Painter, whatever as long as you can save a .tga file.</p>\n<p>We'll\
      \ create a new file. Enter a size of 256 X 256.</p>\n<p>Note: Texture files\
      \ must be in multiples of 2;</p>\n<p>2 X 2</p>\n<p>4 X 4</p>\n<p>8, 16, 32,\
      \ 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024</p>\n<p>Make a quick pattern. Don't go getting all\
      \ creative on me, just do something quick and dirty like a gradient or something\
      \ and save it as a 24 bit .tga. You don't have to save it in the Unreal folder,\
      \ however I have found it makes things a lot easier if you create a Temp folder\
      \ in the same directory as your UT2003 folder like this: C:\\Unreal Projects.\
      \ It just simplifies things for me to have a folder one level up from Unreal\
      \ to store all my source and temp files. Now let's go back to Unreal and in\
      \ the Texture Browser window, Do File-&gt; Import and locate your .tga texture.\
      \ When you go Open, an Import Texture dialog box appears. Under Package, you\
      \ can name it anything you like but I highly recommend distinguishing it as\
      \ a texture package like this: myFilenameTex. Although there are different types\
      \ of packages in Unreal, the application is sometimes unable to distinguish\
      \ between different packages if they share the same name which can cause major,\
      \ and I mean MAJOR problems. You'll go to open your file and all your textures\
      \ will be gone for good. No joke. So develop a descriptive naming convention\
      \ for your Packages from the start and you will avoid SERIOUS problems. eg.;\
      \ myFilenameTex, myFilenameMesh, myFilenameAnims. Under Package name is Group\
      \ name. This can be blank since we're just working with the one texture for\
      \ now. Group is for when you have like 40 different Wall textures and 20 ceiling\
      \ textures and you need a way to keep them all organized. That can be more useful\
      \ later on. Don't even worry about it for now. Leave the texture name as it\
      \ is and click OK and there should be your new texture in the texture browser</p>\n\

      <p>OK so we got a new package with a grand total of 1 texture in it. Let's save\
      \ our new package for later use. In the Texture Browser window Do File -&gt;\
      \ Save. We are taken to the default Texture folder inside the UT2003 folder,\
      \ and that's exactly where we will save our Package. You understand the difference\
      \ there? You can save your source textures anywhere you like but you should\
      \ save your texture Package in UT2003\\Textures. Got it? Ok so now that we got\
      \ it in there go ahead and apply your new texture to your added cube and apply\
      \ one of the Alleria Terrain textures to all the surfaces of your room (Subtracted\
      \ Space). (Hint - Use Shift B to select all.) To get back to Alleria Terrain\
      \ click on the white dialog that's currently says the name of your texture package.\

      \ yet, please do so now and bring it up to par, Build All, everything. We're\
      \ going to continue on from there. You should have a 512 room with a 256 cube\
      \ inside. Select your added cube. Note if it turns bright red you haven't selected\
      \ the added space, you've selected the Red Builder Brush. To separate the brush\
      \ from the cube Ctrl drag anywhere out in open space in one of the viewports\
      \ and the Builder brush should automatically become selected. Drag it off to\
      \ the side somewhere to get it out of the way. Note how added spaces are blue\
      \ and subtracted spaces are brown. Click on the edge of your blue added space\
      \ to select it. It should turn bright blue. Now go click on your Scale button\
      \ and resize it. Note how you can see the updates in the orthogonal views but\
      \ in the Perspective view there's like 2 boxes now. This is just to save processing\
      \ power. You won't actually see your changes until you Build All</p>\n<h3><span\

    text: "==Learn The Tools==\n\nPart 2 of the [[Legacy:Create A Room|Create a Room]]\
      \ tutorial\n\nThis tutorial uses a hands-on approach. We won't be telling you\
      \ 6 different methods for placing an object in a scene, or give you lengthy\
      \ technical explanations. You'll do one exercise, then the next, and maybe further\
      \ down there'll be another exercise which incorporates some of one and some\
      \ of the other, and before you know it you're doing it! :) As this is intended\
      \ to be a beginner's tutorial, we will assume you know nothing, we will try\
      \ to use language a 10 year old can understand, and we are not afraid to repeat\
      \ ourselves. Also note that we are not afraid to say things a second time. This\
      \ document is intended to represent the current build, and should be updated\
      \ accordingly.\n\nThere's 200 [[Legacy:Create A Room|Create a Room]] tutorials\
      \ out there but how many take you just a step further? This one does.\n\n----\n\
      \nOK, if you've already done the previous tutorial, let's get rid of that just\
      \ to make you do it all over again.\n\nDo File -> New\n\n===Add a Builder Brush\
      \ ===\n\nLeft click on the Cube Builder icon in the top left corner of your\
      \ Brush Builders pallete\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface.toolbox.defbuilders.gif|]]\n\
      \nThe [[Legacy:Red Builder Brush|Red Builder Brush]] appears in your scene at\
      \ the default size of 256 Unreal Units ([[Legacy:UU|UU]]). See [[Legacy:General\
      \ Scale And Dimensions|General Scale and Dimensions]].\n\nIn the Perspective\
      \ window right drag around till you can see your brush.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_AddSub1.jpeg|center|The\
      \ Red Builder Brush, like the 2D circle which represents where you can potentially\
      \ paint a round 2D shape in Photoshop, represents where you can potentially\
      \ create a 3D shape in Unreal: also known as a Brush for some reason.]]\n\n\
      ===Translate ===\n\nYou got your 3 gray windows; Top, Front and Side orthogonal\
      \ viewports. In the Front window, hold the Ctrl key and left drag anywhere in\
      \ the window. Your Builder Brush should turn a bright red indicating that it\
      \ is selected and you can drag it around in the window. Move it up a bit. Now\
      \ click in the Perspective window. The window should update and your Builder\
      \ Brush snaps upwards.\n\n===Auto Update ===\n\nClick the little joystick icon\
      \ in the top left corner of the Perspective window, which is confusingly identical\
      \ to the Play Map! button. Now in the Side window Ctrl drag your Builder Brush\
      \ around a bit. You should now see immediate feedback in the Perspective window.\
      \ You can turn Auto Update on in the other windows if you like. Drag it around\
      \ a bit in the Top window. Note how each time you select a new window the border\
      \ turns white indicating it is selected. If you have a slower computer or a\
      \ mind bogglingly complex scene, you can turn Auto Update off. If you close\
      \ the file and open it back up again, your settings are lost, you'll have to\
      \ turn it back on again.\n\n===Scale ===\n\nClick on the scale button just below\
      \ the camera icon in the top left of your toolbox: [[Image:Legacy_button.mode.scale.gif|]]\
      \ (If you hold your mouse over it, it should say Actor Scaling). It becomes\
      \ highlighted and your cursor changes to a midievil cross. Hold the Ctrl key\
      \ and left drag slowly left and right in one of the orthogonal Viewports the\
      \ Red Builder Brush scales in one axis. Now Ctrl right drag. It scales in a\
      \ different axis. Do the same in the two other orthogonal views. Note how each\
      \ window shares one scaling axes with one window and one axis with the other.\
      \ I won't elaborate on which window does what axis. Just play around a bit till\
      \ you get a feel for the scaling thing. If you accidentally scale in the wrong\
      \ direction, just hit Ctrl Z to undo. You can hold both mouse buttons at the\
      \ same time and scale two axis at once.\n\n===Rotate ===\n\nJust to the right\
      \ of the Actor Scaling button, click the Actor Rotate button. [[Image:Legacy_button.mode.rotate.gif|]]\
      \ Ctrl left drag in any of the viewports and your Builder Brush will rotate\
      \ in 1 axis relative to the window view. Ctrl right drag and it rotates in a\
      \ second axis. With it rotated a bit off from 90 degrees, go back to the scale\
      \ button and try scaling. Note how it flattens out relative to the camera view,\
      \ not the object itself, so now instead of a cube, we have like a rhomboid shaped\
      \ object.\n\n===Where's the Cursor? ===\n\nOK, so now you got your Brush rotated\
      \ and scaled and you want to move it around a bit like before, so you remember\
      \ how to do that, right? You just Ctrl left drag in one of the windows and...\
      \ OOPS!  We're still in rotate mode!  Must be the button undernerneath Actor\
      \ Scaling with the T in it, right? Sorry, if you hold your mouse over the button,\
      \ it says that's for moving textures. You can hold your mouse over every button\
      \ on the interface and there's not a move tool to be found. ?????? Well, in\
      \ their magnanimous effort to do everything different, Epic has cleverly disguised\
      \ the traditional cursor button that everybody in the world is familiar with\
      \ as a camera. Go figure.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_button.mode.camera.gif|]]\n\nClick\
      \ the camera button now to return you to normal operation.\n\n===Reset ===\n\
      \nNow go back and left click on your Cube Builder button like you're going to\
      \ build a new cube. Does it create a new cube? Surprise! No, it resets the Builder\
      \ Brush. Remember we haven't actually created anything yet, we're only playing\
      \ with the Builder Brush here.\n\n===Add a Cube ===\n\nOK let's Add a Space.\
      \ If you've already done the [[Legacy:Create A Room|Create a Room]] tutorial,\
      \ by now you should know how to [[Legacy:Subtract A Space|Subtract a Space]],\
      \ so you should pretty much intuitively know where to find the Add a Space button,\
      \ right? But just in case, since this is a beginner's tutorial, let me refresh\
      \ your memory.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_AddSub5.jpeg|]]\n\nOK so you got your Builder\
      \ Brush and you click Add and you should see the default texture appear. Whoops!\
      \ nothing happened. Click it again. Nope. Click it a little harder and longer.\
      \ Sorry. Oh that's right, I bet you forgot to Build All like in the Create a\
      \ Room tutorial, right? Just to be different, this time instead of clicking\
      \ on the Build All button, go to the menu bar at the very top and select Build\
      \ -> Build all. Still no cube. Maybe we forgot to enter the proper size dimensions,\
      \ so right click on the Cube Builder button and let's enter some new values\
      \ of 512, 512 and 512. Click the Build button and close the window and... HEY!\
      \ What's that blue thing? The Builder brush obviously made something so why\
      \ isn't it showing up in the scene? Not only that but if you carefully click\
      \ on the edge of the blue box to select it, then hold the Ctrl key and left\
      \ drag, you will see that it separates from another one underneath and maybe\
      \ yet another depending on how many times you clicked the Add button. So where's\
      \ our cube? You remember in the previous tutorial Create a Room, we had you\
      \ Subtract a Space before anything else? That is because this is the fundamental\
      \ building block of everything you can place in the visible Unreal world.\n\n\
      '''''You can not add solid geometry into your Map unless you first place it\
      \ into a Subtracted Space.'''''\n\nIn much the same way that in the real world\
      \ you can't put a human into space without being in some type of container,\
      \ in the Unreal world everything must be in a container, or Subtracted Space\
      \ to be visible. Nuff said?\n\n===No, Add a Cube, really ===\n\nAnd you know\
      \ what? If you just take the 512 Builder Brush you just made and subtract it\
      \ out around your added space you ain't gonna get nothin buddy. Sorry to mislead\
      \ you. We're just going to have to go back and do it all over again. So therefore...\n\
      \nDo File -> New\n\nSubtract a Large Space - Right click on the Cube Builder\
      \ button and ensure that the values are set to 512 and click Build. Click on\
      \ the Subtract button..\n\nNow enter new values of 256, click Build and close\
      \ the window.\n\nClick on the Add button. Voila! That wasn't so hard now, was\
      \ it?\n\n===Build All? ===\n\nAt this point we're just about at the point where\
      \ we were in the previous Create a Room tutorial, only now we've got a room\
      \ with an added space in it and we're just about ready to play our Map, right?\
      \ So let's click the Build All button. (The one at the top that looks like a\
      \ cube with a lightbulb next to it, remember? Sorry folks, this is a beginner's\
      \ tutorial.) And BANG! everything suddenly disappears in the Perspective window.\
      \ What happened to our room? I'm not leading you on another wild goose chase\
      \ am I? Actually yes and no. At the top of the Perspective window is some buttons\
      \ which look like various cubes. If you hold your mouse over them you can see\
      \ that they represent different methods of rendering the viewport such as Wireframe,\
      \ etc. About the 4th one over, click on the one that says Textured. Now you\
      \ can see that your room is indeed still there. When we clicked the Build All\
      \ button, we just rendered the scene and forgot to add a light first. If you\
      \ go a couple buttons over and switch back to Dynamic Light, you will notice\
      \ that you can't see the grid lines through the cube any longer. We have just\
      \ created a pitch black room.\n\nAnd of course you realize if we added a light\
      \ now and clicked Build all, then went to play our map, you would get an error\
      \ if we didn't add a PlayerStart first. The game needs to know where to spawn\
      \ a player into the scene. So go ahead and add those now as we're going to continue\
      \ the tutorial from here.. You might want to switch over from Dynamic Light\
      \ back to Textured for a moment so you can see what you're doing as there is\
      \ currently no light in the scene.\n\n===One More Time! ===\n\nSo to reiterrate:\n\
      \nYou pretty much have to do all the steps in the Create a Room tutorial;\n\
      # Subtract a Space\n# Add a Light\n# Add a Playerstart\n\nbefore you can play\
      \ your map in the Unreal game.\n\n===Change the Texture ===\n\nOK so you should\
      \ have a 512 subtracted room with a 256 added cube in it. It might be kind of\
      \ hard to distinguish the added space because it has the same texture as the\
      \ subtracted space, so let's change the texture to a contrasting color. First\
      \ left click one of the surfaces of your added cube. It should turn a blueish\
      \ color indicating it's selected. Now open the Texture Browser - Click on the\
      \ button in the top toolbar that looks like a Landscape Painting. The Texture\
      \ Browser opens. \n\nNow in the Texture Browser window. Go to File -> Open.\
      \ You should be taken to Unreal's default texture folder with a list of Texture\
      \ Packages. Let's open Alleria Terrain. Select any of the textures which appear\
      \ on the list and it should be immediately applied to the selected surface of\
      \ your cube. Select a different surface and click on a different texture. BANG\
      \ there it is. Simple, huh? Now hold the Ctrl key and click on multiple surfaces\
      \ to group select. If you accidentaly clicked one you didn't want simply Ctrl\
      \ click a second time to deselect it.\n\nLet's say we want to apply textures\
      \ to all the walls but not the floor and ceiling. First select one surface.\
      \ Now press Shift B and all the surfaces become selected.. Now hold Ctrl and\
      \ deselect the floor and ceiling. Click on a new Texture and there you are.\
      \ Easy!\n\n===Importing Your Own Textures ===\n\nOK enough using the same textures\
      \ everybody else is using. Let's jump straight into creating our own, shall\
      \ we?\n\nOpen your favorite graphics app, Photoshop, Painter, whatever as long\
      \ as you can save a .tga file.\n\nWe'll create a new file. Enter a size of 256\
      \ X 256.\n\nNote: Texture files must be in multiples of 2;\n\n2 X 2\n\n4 X 4\n\
      \n8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024\n\nMake a quick pattern. Don't go getting\
      \ all creative on me, just do something quick and dirty like a gradient or something\
      \ and save it as a 24 bit .tga. You don't have to save it in the Unreal folder,\
      \ however I have found it makes things a lot easier if you create a Temp folder\
      \ in the same directory as your UT2003 folder like this: C:\\Unreal Projects.\
      \ It just simplifies things for me to have a folder one level up from Unreal\
      \ to store all my source and temp files. Now let's go back to Unreal and in\
      \ the Texture Browser window, Do File-> Import and locate your .tga texture.\
      \ When you go Open, an Import Texture dialog box appears. Under Package, you\
      \ can name it anything you like but I highly recommend distinguishing it as\
      \ a texture package like this: myFilenameTex. Although there are different types\
      \ of packages in Unreal, the application is sometimes unable to distinguish\
      \ between different packages if they share the same name which can cause major,\
      \ and I mean MAJOR problems. You'll go to open your file and all your textures\
      \ will be gone for good. No joke. So develop a descriptive naming convention\
      \ for your Packages from the start and you will avoid SERIOUS problems. eg.;\
      \ myFilenameTex, myFilenameMesh, myFilenameAnims. Under Package name is Group\
      \ name. This can be blank since we're just working with the one texture for\
      \ now. Group is for when you have like 40 different Wall textures and 20 ceiling\
      \ textures and you need a way to keep them all organized. That can be more useful\
      \ later on. Don't even worry about it for now. Leave the texture name as it\
      \ is and click OK and there should be your new texture in the texture browser\n\
      \n===Save yer Package ===\n\nOK so we got a new package with a grand total of\
      \ 1 texture in it. Let's save our new package for later use. In the Texture\
      \ Browser window Do File -> Save. We are taken to the default Texture folder\
      \ inside the UT2003 folder, and that's exactly where we will save our Package.\
      \ You understand the difference there? You can save your source textures anywhere\
      \ you like but you should save your texture Package in UT2003\\Textures. Got\
      \ it? Ok so now that we got it in there go ahead and apply your new texture\
      \ to your added cube and apply one of the Alleria Terrain textures to all the\
      \ surfaces of your room (Subtracted Space). (Hint - Use Shift B to select all.)\
      \ To get back to Alleria Terrain click on the white dialog that's currently\
      \ says the name of your texture package. A drop down menu appears with a list\
      \ of the default Texture Packages and any others you may have opened during\
      \ this session. \n\n===Resizing a Space. ===\n\nOk so if you haven't added your\
      \ Light and Playerstart yet, please do so now and bring it up to par, Build\
      \ All, everything. We're going to continue on from there. You should have a\
      \ 512 room with a 256 cube inside. Select your added cube. Note if it turns\
      \ bright red you haven't selected the added space, you've selected the Red Builder\
      \ Brush. To separate the brush from the cube Ctrl drag anywhere out in open\
      \ space in one of the viewports and the Builder brush should automatically become\
      \ selected. Drag it off to the side somewhere to get it out of the way. Note\
      \ how added spaces are blue and subtracted spaces are brown. Click on the edge\
      \ of your blue added space to select it. It should turn bright blue. Now go\
      \ click on your Scale button and resize it. Note how you can see the updates\
      \ in the orthogonal views but in the Perspective view there's like 2 boxes now.\
      \ This is just to save processing power. You won't actually see your changes\
      \ until you Build All\n\n===Get On With It! ===\n\nOK, so you made a room. So\
      \ what? Now you should be familiar enough with the basic tools in Unreal to\
      \ explore the WIKI further and make some sense out of some of the more advanced\
      \ pages. I'm gonna cut you loose now. The Unreal world is yours to explore.\
      \ :) \n\nNow that you've got the basics, you might want to check out [[Legacy:Mapping_Lessons/Functional_Map|Mapping_Lessons/Functional_Map]]\
      \ . It is identical to this tutorial but is written in the shorter, more concise\
      \ WIKI style. You might want to compare it to familiarize yourself with the\
      \ basic, shorthand style of other pages you will find throught the WIKI.\n\n\
      ----\n\n==Where To Go Next ==\n\nFrom here you might want to check out a few\
      \ of the tutorials featured in the sequence of [[Legacy:Mapping Lessons|Mapping\
      \ Lessons]]. \n# [[Legacy:Place A Pickup|Place a Pickup]] - Adding Weapons to\
      \ your Map \n# [[Legacy:Creating A Terrain|Creating a Terrain]] \n# [[Legacy:Adding\
