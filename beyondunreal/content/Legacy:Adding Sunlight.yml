      \ Neutron:</b> Hope I'm doing this right (editing whole document to add a comment).\
      \ I didn't understand you saying that subtract brushes \"block\" sunlight without\
      \ fake backdrop. What do you mean? Did it not work at all, or did the walls\
      \ get funny lighting or what? I can't see how this would effect the lighting\
      \ on the terrain.</p>\n<p><b>Birelli:</b> I'm not positive but I believe the\
      \ reason that you might think that the large subtractive brush is actually \"\
      blocking\" the light is that in order to get SunLight, you need to have walls\
      \ set to fake backdrop for it to come \"from\". I think it's easier just to\
      \ think of it as that light comes \"out of your skybox\" and is transmitted\
      \ through the fake backdrop walls, although this is most definitely not true\
      \ in a technical sense.</p>\n<p><b>CCFreak2K:</b> If you go to <a href=\"/Legacy:Creating_A_Terrain\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Creating A Terrain\">Creating A Terrain</a>, you'll see that\
      \ your sunlight actor should be placed in your level, not in your skybox (this\
      \ is noted further down in that page). You might also want to note that your\
      \ box without fakebackdrop is much like a solid wall, and I can't remember the\
      \ last time I saw sunlight go though a solid wall.</p>\n<p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b>\
      \ Wait. I'm confused. Which brushes are you setting to fake backdrop? I hope\
      \ no one minds me explaining what a fake backdrop is in this lesson. I basically\
      \ copied the explaination from <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Flags_(UT)\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Surface Flags (UT)\">Surface_Flags_(UT)</a></p>\n<p><b>Guest:</b> The\
      \ way I think of it is that when you subtract a space, you are creating its\
      \ internal ceiling, floor, and four walls. You can place various textures on\
      \ these. You can also set \"fake backdrop\" to make the wall \"invisible\".\
      \ At runtime, the player will not be aware of the wall unless he/she collides\
      \ with it, as the renderer will draw the skybox in its place.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ IIRC, you should imagine that the sunlight is coming from infinitely far away,\
      \ and that even though your Sunlight actor is IN your map, the light is coming\
      \ from outside the subtracted area. So it needs to get through the \"ceiling\"\
      \ of your area, so that has to be set to Fake Backdrop to let the light through.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Moofed:</b> If your meshes suddenly start to flicker really badly and\
      \ you have serveral Sunlight actors, try deleting some. Once I had only 4 Sunlights\
      \ the flickering went away.</p>\n<p><b>Unknown:</b> (Regarding the \"add the\
      \ Sunlight actor\" step) How exactly do you do this? Please fill in the gaps\
      \ in this explanation.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> The link <a href=\"/Legacy:Add_An_Actor\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Add An Actor\">Add an Actor</a>, as you found out, is a <a\
      \ href=\"/Category:Legacy_Basic_Procedure\" title=\"Category:Legacy Basic Procedure\"\
      >Category:Legacy Basic Procedure</a>, a foundational building block of knowledge\
      \ in using the editor that will be used in many different tutorials on this\
      \ wiki. As such, it has been categorized as a \"first step\" for beginning users\
      \ of the Unreal Editor. Once you've mastered that knowledge (and the associated\
      \ terminology used here on the wiki), you will find this becomes second nature.\
      \ Explaining this basic step (or several others covered in the Basic Procedure\
      \ pages), would not only appear redundant, but cluttered and eventually disorganized\
      \ to more experienced users. As a side note, please keep your opinions in the\
      \ Discussion section of the page.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time\
