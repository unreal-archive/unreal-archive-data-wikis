      \ ways to set up a Subversion server on your Windows machine. The easiest way,\
      \ is just to put a shortcut to the <tt>svnserve.exe</tt> program with appropriate\
      \ arguments in your Startup folder, but this has some drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>It's only running when you're logged in.</li>\n<li>It causes an empty command\
      \ window to show up on your desktop. This can be minimized, but it still shows\
      \ up in the taskbar.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />\nA better way would actually be\
      \ to set up the Subversion server as a Windows service, which avoids both of\
      \ these problems. This document will describe how to do this.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The \"Windows Server\
      \ 2003 Resource Kit Tools\" package can be downloaded from Microsoft's download\
      \ site (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads\"\
      >http://www.microsoft.com/downloads</a>) under the \"System Management Tools\"\
      \ download category (or directly from <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\"\

      \ Note that Microsoft does seem to have a number of confusingly-similarly named\
      \ packages available for download from their site. You're looking for the one\
      \ which has a file name of <tt>rktools.exe</tt>.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3><span\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Install the Windows Resource Kit Tools\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As with Subversion,\
      \ this is a simple matter of double-clicking the downloaded installer and following\
      \ the prompts. After doing this, to test that the installation all went ok,\
      \ open a command prompt window (Start-&gt;Run, \"<tt>cmd</tt>\"), and type \"\
      <tt>instsrv</tt>\". You should get a brief message describing INSTSRV's command\
      \ syntax. (If you don't, try looking for <tt>INSTSRV.EXE</tt> in the location\
      \ you told the Resource Kit to install, and use its full path name instead)</p>\n\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Configure Subversion to Run as a Service\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>First we will need\
      \ to install an appropriately-named service using the <tt>SRVANY.EXE</tt> utility\
      \ provided by the Resource Kit. To do this, you will need to open a command\
      \ window and type the following:</p>\n<pre> instsrv \"Subversion\" \"C:\\Program\
      \ Files\\Windows Resource Kits\\Tools\\srvany.exe\"  \n \n</pre>\n<p>(This assumes\
      \ you've installed the Resource Kit Tools in the default location of <tt>C:\\\
      Program Files\\Windows Resource Kits\\Tools</tt>. If you installed it somewhere\
      \ else, obviously, you'll need to change the path to <tt>srvany.exe</tt> appropriately.)</p>\n\
      <p><br />\nThe SRVANY program is designed to allow any program to run as a service,\
      \ but we still need to tell it <i>what</i> program it's supposed to be running.\
      \ Unfortunately, this step requires a little bit of fiddling with the Windows\
      \ Registry.</p>\n<p><br />\n<b>NOTE:</b> Changing the wrong things in the Registry\
      \ can seriously break your Windows system. Always be careful when using the\
      \ Windows Registry Editor, and be sure to back up your system before doing changes\
      \ like this. (That having been said, if you're careful about what you change,\
      \ using the Registry Editor usually isn't as scary as it sounds)</p>\n<p>Start\
      \ up the Registry Editor by choosing \"Run...\" from the Start menu and typing\
      \ the following:</p>\n<pre> regedt32  \n</pre>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>On the left\
      \ side of the Registry Editor is what looks like a directory tree view (these\
      \ are locations in the registry, not actual directories on the disk, but the\
      \ navigation is the same). Find the following path and select this folder:</p>\n\
      <pre> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Subversion  \n\
      </pre>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the Edit pulldown menu, select New-&gt;Key</li>\n\
      <li>For the name of the new key, type \"Parameters\"</li>\n<li>From the Edit\
      \ pulldown menu, select New-&gt;String Value</li>\n<li>For the name of the new\
      \ string value, type \"Application\"</li>\n<li>From the Edit pulldown menu,\
      \ select \"Modify\" (or just double-click the new \"Application\" key in the\
      \ right pane)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An \"Edit String\" dialog box will appear. Type\
      \ the following:</p>\n<pre> C:\\Program Files\\Subversion\\bin\\svnserve.exe\
      \  \n</pre>\n<p>(This assumes Subversion is installed in <tt>C:\\Program Files\\\
      Subversion</tt>, of course)</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the Edit pulldown\
      \ menu, select New-&gt;String Value</li>\n<li>For the name of the new string\
      \ value, type \"AppParameters\"</li>\n<li>From the Edit pulldown menu, select\
      \ \"Modify\" (or just double-click the new \"AppParameters\" key in the right\
      \ pane)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An \"Edit String\" dialog box will appear. Type the\
      \ following:</p>\n<pre> -d -r C:\\Subversion  \n</pre>\n<p>(the <tt>-d-</tt>\
      \ flag tells it to run as a daemon (server) process, and the <tt>-r C:\\Subversion-</tt>\
      \ tells it where the directory with the repositories lives)</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n\
      <p><br />\nNow our service should be configured properly, we just need to give\
      \ it a try:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Services control panel (this may be under\
      \ the \"Administrative Tools\" subfolder in Control Panels).</li>\n<li>You should\
      \ now be able to find a \"Subversion\" service in the list of services. Select\
      \ this service.</li>\n<li>From the Action menu, select \"Start\".</li>\n</ol>\n\
      <p><br />\nIf all goes well, the Subversion process should now say \"Started\"\
      \ in its Status column.</p>\n<p><br />\nYou now have a Subversion server running,\
      \ serving all of the repositories under your <tt>C:\\Subversion</tt> directory.\
      \ This means that repositories which you've been accessing with URLs like:</p>\n\
      <pre> file:///C:/Subversion/repository_name  \n</pre>\n<p>..can now also be\
      \ accessed as..</p>\n<pre> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"\
      svn://localhost/repository_name\">svn://localhost/repository_name</a>  \n</pre>\n\
      <p>(note that there are only two slashes (//) before \"localhost\")</p>\n<p><br\
      \ />\nSo let's give our new server a try. Assuming that you've set up a repository\
      \ as described in <a href=\"/Legacy:Setting_Up_Subversion\" title=\"Legacy:Setting\
      \ Up Subversion\">Setting up Subversion</a>, we should be able to access it\
      \ now as <tt><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"svn://localhost/UT_work\"\
      >svn://localhost/UT_work</a></tt>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right click on a file or folder\
      \ somewhere (doesn't matter where) and select \"TortoiseSVN-&gt;Repo-Browser\"\
      \ from the pop-up menu.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the repository URL, type:</p>\n\
      <pre> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"svn://localhost/UT_work\"\
      >svn://localhost/UT_work</a>  \n</pre>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><br />\nYou should\
      \ see your repository and its contents show up in the Repository Browser window.</p>\n\
      <p><br /></p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Easy_Alternative\">The\

      <dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<pre>SVNService -install <i>[SVNServe parameters]</i>  \n\
      </pre>\n<p>This will create a new service with the name \"SVNService\". The\
      \ service is initially configured to be started manually.\\\\</p>\n<p>Useful\
      \ SVNServe parameters might be \"-d -r D:\\Path\\To\\Repository\".</p>\n<dl>\n\

      \ the service&#160;</dt>\n<dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<pre><tt>SVNService -remove</tt>\
      \  \n</pre>\n<p>This will also stop the service if it's till running.</p>\n\
      <p><br />\nNote that SVNService can manage only one service. You'll have to\
      \ go the long way described above if you want more than that.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n\

      \ section: Controlling Access\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>By default, Subversion repositories accessed through\
      \ a Subversion server are readable by anyone, but only writable by people who\
      \ have been specifically authorized to do so. Obviously, you will want to do\
      \ a bit of configuration to specify who's allowed to do what, and how Subversion\
      \ is supposed to tell who people are.</p>\n<p><br />\nThis configuration is\
      \ done by editing the <tt>svnserve.conf</tt> file located in the <tt>conf</tt>\
      \ directory of each repository (for example, <tt>C:\\Subversion\\UT_work\\conf\\\
      svnserve.conf</tt>). Open this file in a text editor.</p>\n<p><br />\nIn the\
      \ configuration file, lines starting with <tt>#</tt> are comments, so as you\
      \ can see, the default file has everything commented out. You will want to add\
      \ a few lines (or uncomment the ones that are already there):</p>\n<pre> [general]\
      \  \n anon-access = read  \n auth-access = write  \n password-db = passwd  \n\
      \ realm = My Subversion Repository  \n \n</pre>\n<p>(obviously, you can change\
      \ the <tt>anon-access</tt> and <tt>auth-access</tt> lines if this isn't the\
      \ behavior you want. For example, you could change them to <tt>anon-access=none</tt>\
      \ if you don't want anonymous users seeing your repository contents, and <tt>auth-access=read</tt>\
      \ if you only want to provide read access to the people you specify (in which\
      \ case you will only have write access via local (<tt>file:</tt>) URLs))</p>\n\
      <p><br />\nThe <tt>realm</tt> parameter is a way of grouping multiple repositories\
      \ to use a single login. If two repositories have the same realm, all Subversion\
      \ clients will assume they can use the same username/password to login to them.\
      \ Since we're not working with multiple repositories (yet), it doesn't really\
      \ matter what we put here as long as it's unique, but it is displayed by many\
      \ clients when prompting for a password, so it's good to use something descriptive.</p>\n\
      <p><br />\nThe <tt>password-db</tt> parameter specifies the name of a file to\
      \ have usernames and passwords in, which is relative to the <tt>conf</tt> directory.\
      \ In this case, we've specified a filename of <tt>passwd</tt>, so we now need\
      \ to create a <tt>passwd</tt> file in the same directory as our <tt>svnserve.conf</tt>.\
      \ In the new <tt>passwd</tt> file, add the following:</p>\n<pre> [users]  \n\
      \ my_username = my_password  \n \n</pre>\n<p>(Obviously, replace <tt>my_username</tt>\
      \ and <tt>my_password</tt> with an appropriate username and password for yourself).\
      \ You can also add as many other account usernames and passwords as you want\
      \ in the same form under the [users] section.</p>\n<p><br />\nThere is one other\
      \ aspect to access which needs to be mentioned: In order for other people to\
      \ access your new Subversion server, they will need to be able to connect to\
      \ your machine on TCP port 3690. You will need to make sure that your machine\
      \ is reachable from the outside world (not behind a NAT router or firewall of\
      \ some kind) and that port 3690 is not blocked by any personal firewall software\
      \ you may have installed). Other users should then be able to access your repository\
      \ using URLs of the form:</p>\n<pre> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\"\

      \ only running when you're logged in.  \n* It causes an empty command window\
      \ to show up on your desktop.  This can be minimized, but it still shows up\
      \ in the taskbar.  \n  \n\nA better way would actually be to set up the Subversion\
      \ server as a Windows service, which avoids both of these problems.  This document\
      \ will describe how to do this.  \n  \n\n===Download the Windows Resource Kit\
      \ Tools  ===\n  \n\nThe \"Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools\" package can\
      \ be downloaded from Microsoft's download site (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads)\
      \ under the \"System Management Tools\" download category (or directly from\
      \ http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9d467a69-57ff-4ae7-96ee-b18c4790cffd&displaylang=en).\
      \  Note that Microsoft does seem to have a number of confusingly-similarly named\
      \ packages available for download from their site.  You're looking for the one\
      \ which has a file name of <tt>rktools.exe</tt>.  \n  \n\n===Install the Windows\
      \ Resource Kit Tools  ===\n  \n\nAs with Subversion, this is a simple matter\
      \ of double-clicking the downloaded installer and following the prompts.  After\
      \ doing this, to test that the installation all went ok, open a command prompt\
      \ window (Start->Run, \"<tt>cmd</tt>\"), and type \"<tt>instsrv</tt>\".  You\
      \ should get a brief message describing INSTSRV's command syntax. (If you don't,\
      \ try looking for <tt>INSTSRV.EXE</tt> in the location you told the Resource\
      \ Kit to install, and use its full path name instead)  \n  \n\n===Configure\
      \ Subversion to Run as a Service  ===\n  \n\nFirst we will need to install an\
      \ appropriately-named service using the <tt>SRVANY.EXE</tt> utility provided\
      \ by the Resource Kit.  To do this, you will need to open a command window and\
      \ type the following:  \n  \n  instsrv \"Subversion\" \"C:\\Program Files\\\
      Windows Resource Kits\\Tools\\srvany.exe\"  \n  \n\n(This assumes you've installed\
      \ the Resource Kit Tools in the default location of <tt>C:\\Program Files\\\
      Windows Resource Kits\\Tools</tt>.  If you installed it somewhere else, obviously,\
      \ you'll need to change the path to <tt>srvany.exe</tt> appropriately.)  \n\
      \  \n\nThe SRVANY program is designed to allow any program to run as a service,\
      \ but we still need to tell it ''what'' program it's supposed to be running.\
      \  Unfortunately, this step requires a little bit of fiddling with the Windows\
      \ Registry.  \n  \n\n'''NOTE:''' Changing the wrong things in the Registry can\
      \ seriously break your Windows system.  Always be careful when using the Windows\
      \ Registry Editor, and be sure to back up your system before doing changes like\
      \ this.  (That having been said, if you're careful about what you change, using\
      \ the Registry Editor usually isn't as scary as it sounds)  \n  \n# \nStart\
      \ up the Registry Editor by choosing \"Run...\" from the Start menu and typing\
      \ the following:  \n  regedt32  \n\n  \n# \nOn the left side of the Registry\
      \ Editor is what looks like a directory tree view (these are locations in the\
      \ registry, not actual directories on the disk, but the navigation is the same).\
      \  Find the following path and select this folder:  \n  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\
      SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Subversion  \n\n  \n# From the Edit pulldown\
      \ menu, select New->Key  \n# For the name of the new key, type \"Parameters\"\
      \  \n# From the Edit pulldown menu, select New->String Value  \n# For the name\
      \ of the new string value, type \"Application\"  \n# From the Edit pulldown\
      \ menu, select \"Modify\" (or just double-click the new \"Application\" key\
      \ in the right pane)  \n# \nAn \"Edit String\" dialog box will appear.  Type\
      \ the following:  \n  C:\\Program Files\\Subversion\\bin\\svnserve.exe  \n\n\
      (This assumes Subversion is installed in <tt>C:\\Program Files\\Subversion</tt>,\
      \ of course)  \n\n  \n# From the Edit pulldown menu, select New->String Value\
      \  \n# For the name of the new string value, type \"AppParameters\"  \n# From\
      \ the Edit pulldown menu, select \"Modify\" (or just double-click the new \"\
      AppParameters\" key in the right pane)  \n# \nAn \"Edit String\" dialog box\
      \ will appear.  Type the following:  \n  -d -r C:\\Subversion  \n\n(the <tt>-d-</tt>\
      \ flag tells it to run as a daemon (server) process, and the <tt>-r C:\\Subversion-</tt>\
      \ tells it where the directory with the repositories lives)  \n\n  \n  \n\n\
      Now our service should be configured properly, we just need to give it a try:\
      \  \n  \n# Open the Services control panel (this may be under the \"Administrative\
      \ Tools\" subfolder in Control Panels).  \n# You should now be able to find\
      \ a \"Subversion\" service in the list of services.  Select this service.  \n\
      # From the Action menu, select \"Start\".  \n  \n\nIf all goes well, the Subversion\
      \ process should now say \"Started\" in its Status column.  \n  \n\nYou now\
      \ have a Subversion server running, serving all of the repositories under your\
      \ <tt>C:\\Subversion</tt> directory.  This means that repositories which you've\
      \ been accessing with URLs like:  \n  file:///C:/Subversion/repository_name\
      \  \n\n..can now also be accessed as..  \n  svn://localhost/repository_name\
      \  \n\n(note that there are only two slashes (//) before \"localhost\")  \n\
      \  \n\nSo let's give our new server a try.  Assuming that you've set up a repository\
      \ as described in [[Legacy:Setting Up Subversion|Setting up Subversion]], we\
      \ should be able to access it now as <tt>svn://localhost/UT_work</tt>:  \n \
      \ \n# Right click on a file or folder somewhere (doesn't matter where) and select\
      \ \"TortoiseSVN->Repo-Browser\" from the pop-up menu.  \n# \nFor the repository\
      \ URL, type:  \n  svn://localhost/UT_work  \n\n  \n  \n\nYou should see your\
      \ repository and its contents show up in the Repository Browser window.  \n\
      \  \n  \n\n==The Easy Alternative  ==\n\nIf all that is far too complicated\
      \ for you, there also is a small commandline tool for setting up SVNServe as\
      \ a service: [http://www.clanlib.org/~mbn/svnservice/ SVNService]. Extract SVNService.exe\
      \ to the same directory as SVNServe.exe (by default that is C:\\Program Files\\\
      Subversion\\bin) and you are ready to go.  \n\nUsage is really easy:  \n; Installing\
      \ the service :\n SVNService -install ''[SVNServe parameters]''  \n\nThis will\
      \ create a new service with the name \"SVNService\". The service is initially\
      \ configured to be started manually.\\\\  \n\nUseful SVNServe parameters might\
      \ be \"-d -r D:\\Path\\To\\Repository\".\n  \n; Changing the service parameters\
      \ :\n <tt>SVNService -setup ''[new SVNServe parameters]''</tt>\n  \n; Removing\
      \ the service :\n <tt>SVNService -remove</tt>  \n\nThis will also stop the service\
      \ if it's till running.\n  \n\nNote that SVNService can manage only one service.\
      \ You'll have to go the long way described above if you want more than that.\
      \  \n  \n  \n\n==Controlling Access  ==\n\nBy default, Subversion repositories\
      \ accessed through a Subversion server are readable by anyone, but only writable\
      \ by people who have been specifically authorized to do so.  Obviously, you\
      \ will want to do a bit of configuration to specify who's allowed to do what,\
      \ and how Subversion is supposed to tell who people are.  \n  \n\nThis configuration\
      \ is done by editing the <tt>svnserve.conf</tt> file located in the <tt>conf</tt>\
      \ directory of each repository (for example, <tt>C:\\Subversion\\UT_work\\conf\\\
      svnserve.conf</tt>).  Open this file in a text editor.  \n  \n\nIn the configuration\
      \ file, lines starting with <tt>#</tt> are comments, so as you can see, the\
      \ default file has everything commented out.  You will want to add a few lines\
      \ (or uncomment the ones that are already there):  \n  \n  [general]  \n  anon-access\
      \ = read  \n  auth-access = write  \n  password-db = passwd  \n  realm = My\
      \ Subversion Repository  \n  \n\n(obviously, you can change the <tt>anon-access</tt>\
      \ and <tt>auth-access</tt> lines if this isn't the behavior you want.  For example,\
      \ you could change them to <tt>anon-access=none</tt> if you don't want anonymous\
      \ users seeing your repository contents, and <tt>auth-access=read</tt> if you\
      \ only want to provide read access to the people you specify (in which case\
      \ you will only have write access via local (<tt>file:</tt>) URLs))  \n  \n\n\
      The <tt>realm</tt> parameter is a way of grouping multiple repositories to use\
      \ a single login.  If two repositories have the same realm, all Subversion clients\
      \ will assume they can use the same username/password to login to them.  Since\
      \ we're not working with multiple repositories (yet), it doesn't really matter\
      \ what we put here as long as it's unique, but it is displayed by many clients\
      \ when prompting for a password, so it's good to use something descriptive.\
      \  \n  \n\nThe <tt>password-db</tt> parameter specifies the name of a file to\
      \ have usernames and passwords in, which is relative to the <tt>conf</tt> directory.\
      \  In this case, we've specified a filename of <tt>passwd</tt>, so we now need\
      \ to create a <tt>passwd</tt> file in the same directory as our <tt>svnserve.conf</tt>.\
      \  In the new <tt>passwd</tt> file, add the following:  \n  \n  [users]  \n\
      \  my_username = my_password  \n  \n\n(Obviously, replace <tt>my_username</tt>\
      \ and <tt>my_password</tt> with an appropriate username and password for yourself).\
      \  You can also add as many other account usernames and passwords as you want\
      \ in the same form under the [users] section.  \n  \n\nThere is one other aspect\
      \ to access which needs to be mentioned:  In order for other people to access\
      \ your new Subversion server, they will need to be able to connect to your machine\
      \ on TCP port 3690.  You will need to make sure that your machine is reachable\
      \ from the outside world (not behind a NAT router or firewall of some kind)\
      \ and that port 3690 is not blocked by any personal firewall software you may\
      \ have installed).  Other users should then be able to access your repository\
      \ using URLs of the form:  \n  \n  svn://your_hostname_or_ip/repository_name\
      \  \n  \n\n==Related Topics  ==\n* [[Legacy:Subversion|Subversion]]  \n* [[Legacy:Version\
