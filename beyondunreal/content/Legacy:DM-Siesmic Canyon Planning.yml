      \ my computer for about 4 days non-stop now, and is only slightly annoying me,\
      \ a good sign, as imo it won't get over the top in a UT3 game. If you want to\
      \ find good music on The Mod Archive, I suggest looking for music which has\
      \ industrial themes, they tend to fit the game fairly well, and imo supplement\
      \ the fast paced action, this is just an idea, depending on what you are making,\

      \ to inform the audience of your creations presence on the other hand can be\
      \ troublesome, and hopefully will be covered later).</p>\n<p>I had chosen a\
      \ volcanic theme to my map, but I was tempted to steer away from lava, and dark\
      \ grey melted rock, choosing more of a sulphur and brimstone look, which I thought\
      \ was far more original than classic lava.</p>\n<p>It was predetermined that\
      \ the map would occupy a canyon, which was roughly Y shaped, and that it would\
      \ have an underground measurement and sensor facility below the intersection\
      \ which could be accessed through 3 small caves that were around the inward\
      \ pointing side of the canyon (towards the center of the Y).</p>\n<p>These caves\
      \ I had decided would be fairly shallow, and have steel doors to mark the transition\
      \ from the sulphurous surface, into the underground area, words I thought that\
      \ would describe the scene where new, shiney, and high tech, I had also given\
      \ some reflection as to the interior lighting of the level, and was thinking\
      \ of cold sharp light blue lights, complimented with warmer orange lights, and\
      \ the occasional small and dull flashing/rotating red alarm lights, which would\
      \ need to be toned down till they didn't steel the limelight of the rest of\
      \ the scene.</p>\n<p>Above ground, I continued to think about things such as\
      \ weather and environment, I was opting for a variety, but being carefull about\
      \ the merging of them, for example, I wanted to include a section in one of\
      \ the canyons leading out of the Y an area that had lots of steam vents and\
      \ poor visibility, as well as some shallow briney yellow sulphor pools, as well\
      \ as perhaps one or two deeper ones, that could be submerged into.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ other two canyon forks I wanted to have a similar feel but with better visibility,\

      \ as thourough-fares through otherwise imapssible terrain.</p>\n<p>As for the\

      \ the possibility of needing more time, and decided that I was to inexperienced\
