      \ and what they want. At any given moment, a bot's attention is on their immediate\
      \ goal (an adrenaline powerup, a gun, an enemy, a flag) and how they plan to\
      \ get there.</p>\n<p>Bots know where all items are in a map. They even know\
      \ exactly when items will respawn, if the WeaponsStay option isn't used.</p>\n\
      <p>Bots know how to move around a map because of a network of Bot Paths the\
      \ mapper has designed. Bots automatically know which route is shortest and even\
      \ which paths are blocked no matter where they are in the map.</p>\n<p>Distance\
      \ fog does not affect bot visibility. If someone is in their field of view,\
      \ they will be spotted no matter the fog density.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Usually\
      \ \"what they want\" is the most powerful item that's closest to them. Normally\
      \ \"how they get there\" is simply the shortest route. Depending on circumstances\
      \ such as <a href=\"/Legacy:AssaultPath\" title=\"Legacy:AssaultPath\">AssaultPaths</a>,\
      \ bot orders, <a href=\"/Legacy:AIScript\" title=\"Legacy:AIScript\">AIScripts</a>,\
      \ weapon preferences or gametype rules, these goals change.</p>\n<p>Bots are\
      \ single-minded and completely forgetful. They approach their immediate goal\
      \ with no knowledge of what they were just doing, so bots can get stuck doing\
      \ something, stopping, and doing it again. Their immediate goal momentarily\
      \ changed, then changed back. This can be observed as a spastic stutter followed\
      \ by a resting pose and, if the bot is truly stuck, will be followed by suicide\
      \ so the bot can respawn. This is typically called \"getting stuck\", and it\
      \ happens when a bot cannot reach a goal, although the map's botplay design\
      \ says they can.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Squads\">Squads</span><span\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A squad is two or\
      \ more bots controlled by the actions of a leader. Squads are formed when one\
      \ player or bot calls for backup or a bot volunteers. (<i>\"I got your back.\"\
      </i>) A leader will move and act normally, while the rest of the squad follows\
      \ the leader no matter what happens. Following bots will fire on enemies on\
      \ sight, but will not chase them unless their leader decides to. Following bots\
      \ who are killed will search for their leader immediately upon respawning. Following\
      \ bots in the middle of a firefight will often retreat to seek out their leader\
      \ who just died and has respawned elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Following bots move to\
      \ the path nodes nearest the leader, and once there if there is no movement\
      \ by the leader, feel free to move around a little; to the next node or two,\
      \ in order to get an extra powerup or fire on an enemy. In other words, following\
      \ bots still have their own goals in mind, but they simply can't act on them\
      \ if the leader's actions conflict.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ on <a href=\"/Legacy:Gametype\" title=\"Legacy:Gametype\">gametype</a>, bots\
      \ will be given certain rules and guidelines to follow. These rules often supersede\
      \ the bots' individual goals. They know that in CTF, <i>\"Attack their base.\"\
      </i> means retrieve the enemy flag and bring it back to our base. In DDOM, bots\
      \ know that holding both DominationPoints is the key to scoring. Typically gametypes\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The bot movement\
      \ is actually quite simple. The bot first decides where it wants to end up.\
      \ Usually a powerup or a weapon, but sometimes it is an enemy flag, ball, ball\
      \ gate, etc. If that object is not a pathnode itself, it finds the pathnode\
      \ nearest its goal. If it is a pathnode than the object itself is used.</p>\n\
      <p>The bot then finds the pathnode nearest itself. It then traces the \"best\"\
      \ path from its goal/goal's nearest pathnode to the nearest pathnode. It then\
      \ makes a beeline from pathnode to pathnode until it reaches its goal. The bot\
      \ will interpolate a little bit to prevent it from suddenly changing direction\
      \ when it touches a pathnode. Note that a bot will generally only make beelines\
      \ between pathnodes, so you must place a pathnode at any place that the bot\
      \ is going to have to turn. If the lines connecting pathnodes cross ANY solid\
      \ obstacle, the bots will probably (but not always) have problems getting around\
      \ that obstacle.</p>\n<p>Bots do not generally seek out other players, preferring\
      \ to find pickups until the player eventually finds itself within their field\
      \ of view. If the player runs away the bot may \"hunt\" it for a short while.\
      \ During this time the bot has the target player as its \"goal\" actor.</p>\n\

  wikitext:
    text: "Bots are controlled by programming code that strictly follows a support\
      \ system in the map. The code is in the [[Legacy:UnrealScript|UnrealScript]]\
      \ classes, and the support system is in the botpath network (see [[Legacy:Bot\
      \ Pathing|Bot Pathing]]).\n\nIn order to act more like free-thinking humans,\
      \ bots must be given a wide range of options at any point in the map.  To understand\
      \ why bots act the way they do and how to make them act differently, it helps\
      \ to understand how a bot thinks. See also [[Legacy:Bot|Bot]] and [[Legacy:Mind\
      \ Reader|Mind Reader]] for UT.\n\n==Perception==\n\nBots see the world in two\
      \ ways: where they can go and what they want.  At any given moment, a bot's\
      \ attention is on their immediate goal (an adrenaline powerup, a gun, an enemy,\
      \ a flag) and how they plan to get there.\n\nBots know where all items are in\
      \ a map.  They even know exactly when items will respawn, if the WeaponsStay\
      \ option isn't used.\n\nBots know how to move around a map because of a network\
      \ of Bot Paths the mapper has designed.  Bots automatically know which route\
      \ is shortest and even which paths are blocked no matter where they are in the\
      \ map.\n\nDistance fog does not affect bot visibility. If someone is in their\
      \ field of view, they will be spotted no matter the fog density. \n\n==Goals==\n\
      \nUsually \"what they want\" is the most powerful item that's closest to them.\
      \  Normally \"how they get there\" is simply the shortest route.  Depending\
      \ on circumstances such as [[Legacy:AssaultPath|AssaultPath]]s, bot orders,\
      \ [[Legacy:AIScript|AIScript]]s, weapon preferences or gametype rules, these\
      \ goals change.\n\nBots are single-minded and completely forgetful.  They approach\
      \ their immediate goal with no knowledge of what they were just doing, so bots\
      \ can get stuck doing something, stopping, and doing it again.  Their immediate\
      \ goal momentarily changed, then changed back.  This can be observed as a spastic\
      \ stutter followed by a resting pose and, if the bot is truly stuck, will be\
      \ followed by suicide so the bot can respawn.  This is typically called \"getting\
      \ stuck\", and it happens when a bot cannot reach a goal, although the map's\
      \ botplay design says they can.\n\n==Squads==\n\nA squad is two or more bots\
      \ controlled by the actions of a leader.  Squads are formed when one player\
      \ or bot calls for backup or a bot volunteers. (''\"I got your back.\"'')  A\
      \ leader will move and act normally, while the rest of the squad follows the\
      \ leader no matter what happens.  Following bots will fire on enemies on sight,\
      \ but will not chase them unless their leader decides to.  Following bots who\
      \ are killed will search for their leader immediately upon respawning.  Following\
      \ bots in the middle of a firefight will often retreat to seek out their leader\
      \ who just died and has respawned elsewhere.\n\nFollowing bots move to the path\
      \ nodes nearest the leader, and once there if there is no movement by the leader,\
      \ feel free to move around a little; to the next node or two, in order to get\
      \ an extra powerup or fire on an enemy.  In other words, following bots still\
      \ have their own goals in mind, but they simply can't act on them if the leader's\
      \ actions conflict.\n\n==GameType==\n\nDepending on [[Legacy:Gametype|gametype]],\
      \ bots will be given certain rules and guidelines to follow.  These rules often\
      \ supersede the bots' individual goals.  They know that in CTF, ''\"Attack their\
      \ base.\"'' means retrieve the enemy flag and bring it back to our base.  In\
      \ DDOM, bots know that holding both DominationPoints is the key to scoring.\
      \  Typically gametypes with more complex rules require higher skilled bots to\
      \ perform well.\n\n==Skill Levels==\n\nAt various skill levels, different pre-programmed\
      \ tactics are engaged.  This gives the player a greater challenge for each increase\
      \ in enemy bot skill level.  A mapper designs botplay keeping in mind that lower\
      \ skill bots have limitations.  ''(The following is a loose description, but\
      \ it's been checked against the Bot code.  Actual limitations are a little technical,\
      \ but this gives a good idea of what's happening.)''\n\n; Novice :Run at 60%\
      \ of full speed, No translocator use, Will not move while engaged in combat\
      \ unless very weak, Limited perception; field of view 30&deg;, modified by BaseAlertness,\
      \ Weak aim that can range ~30&deg; off target, Slow to turn ''(RotationRate.Yaw\
      \ = 30000, less than 1/2 turn per second, adjusted by ReactionTime)''.\n; Average\
      \ : Run at 70% speed, No translocator use, slightly higher accuracy.  Turn just\
      \ a little more than 1/2 per second, adjusted by ReactionTime.\n; Experienced\
      \ :Run at 80% speed.  Translocator use.  Will move and fire simultaeously. \
      \ Field of view 40&deg;, modified by BaseAlertness.  Turn more than 1/2 per\
      \ second, adjusted by ReactionTime.\n; Skilled :Run at 90% speed.  Can DoubleJump.\
      \  Field of view 60&deg;, modified by BaseAlertness.  Turn more than 5/8 per\
      \ second, adjusted by ReactionTime.\n; Adept :Run at full speed.  Will dodge\
      \ enemy fire.  Will close in on enemy.  Aim \"leads\" the target.  Field of\
      \ view 80&deg;, modified by BaseAlertness.  Turn almost 3/4 per second, adjusted\
      \ by ReactionTime.\n; Masterful :ImpactJump use.  Shock combo use.  Will switch\
      \ target enemies during combat. Will stop to replenish powernodes instead of\
      \ heading straight for a vehicle.  Field of view 100&deg;, modified by BaseAlertness.\
      \  Turn almost 7/8 per second, adjusted by ReactionTime.\n; Inhuman :Will dodge\
      \ enemy aim.  No limits on perception; field of view 120&deg;, modified by BaseAlertness.\
      \ Will evacuate a vehicle if it is unable to avoid and will be destroyed by\
      \ an incoming avril.  Turn all the way around in less than 1 second, adjusted\
      \ by ReactionTime.\n; Godlike :All strategies and tactics are engaged.  Omniperceptive;\
      \ they see players and objects even without line of sight.  Highest level of\
      \ accuracy, ranging less than 1&deg; off target.  Turn 1/2 times per one second,\
      \ adjusted by ReactionTime.\n\n==Special behavior==\n\nSome special events or\
      \ settings effect individual bot behavior.\n\n===Bot Attributes===\n\nCustom\
      \ attributes are set up for each player model.  Aggressiveness, Combat Tactics,\
      \ Favorite Weapon, etc. are values used as extra impulses to alter the normal\
      \ goal and path finding code.\n\n===Revenge===\n\nIf a bot is killed, sometimes\
      \ the bot will seek out the killer as their immediate goal. They can still be\
      \ distracted by items or combat.  Pawns who have hurt the bot are added to a\
      \ list of Enemies.  The bot will seek them out in the order they were listed\
      \ until all Enemies are dead (removed) or the bot has died. Players have priority\
      \ on this list.\n\n==Navigation Points==\n\nBot paths govern the routes bots\
      \ plan to take from their position to their immediate goal.  These paths are\
      \ made up of connections between items, like the weapons in the map or nodes\
      \ added specifically to the bot path network.  These connections have limitations\
      \ of length and by available navigating space.  In  [[Legacy:UnrealEd|UnrealEd]],\
      \ these connections will show up as lines that are color coded to indicate the\
      \ size of available navigating space, whether a path is forcably blocked, or\
      \ to indicate a special kind of connection, such as a JumpPad destination. \
      \ \n\nToo many pathnodes in one spot can result in bots getting stuck.  Too\
      \ few pathnodes in your map can result in inefficient navigation.  See also\
      \ [[Legacy:NavigationPoint|NavigationPoint]].\n\n==PlayerStarts and Items==\n\
      \nBot automatically assume a [[Legacy:PlayerStart|PlayerStart]] is a safe place\
      \ to be, as are spawn points for weapons and items.  Because a map's item, weapon,\
      \ and PlayerStart balance takes precedence, these nodes normally make up the\
      \ start of the bot path network.\n\n==Bot Movement Along the Path Network==\n\
      \nThe bot movement is actually quite simple. The bot first decides where it\
      \ wants to end up. Usually a powerup or a weapon, but sometimes it is an enemy\
      \ flag, ball, ball gate, etc. If that object is not a pathnode itself, it finds\
      \ the pathnode nearest its goal. If it is a pathnode than the object itself\
      \ is used.\n\nThe bot then finds the pathnode nearest itself. It then traces\
      \ the \"best\" path from its goal/goal's nearest pathnode to the nearest pathnode.\
      \ It then makes a beeline from pathnode to pathnode until it reaches its goal.\
      \ The bot will interpolate a little bit to prevent it from suddenly changing\
      \ direction when it touches a pathnode. Note that a bot will generally only\
      \ make beelines between pathnodes, so you must place a pathnode at any place\
      \ that the bot is going to have to turn. If the lines connecting pathnodes cross\
      \ ANY solid obstacle, the bots will probably (but not always) have problems\
      \ getting around that obstacle. \n\nBots do not generally seek out other players,\
      \ preferring to find pickups until the player eventually finds itself within\
      \ their field of view. If the player runs away the bot may \"hunt\" it for a\
      \ short while. During this time the bot has the target player as its \"goal\"\
      \ actor.\n\n==Bot Confusion==\n\nOccasionally a bot can get \"stuck\" and moves\
      \ from one node to another, back and forth.  The cause is related to the bot's\
      \ current goal; a pickup, a LiftExit, etc.  For one reason or another, the bot\
      \ believes the goal is reachable, but it cannot reach it, so it turns back only\
      \ to decide it should try and reach it again.  That behavior can continue on\
      \ indefinitely in some cases.  The are two possible solutions for this:\n# Place\
      \ another node to allow the bot to reach their goal.\n# Move things around a\
      \ bit; either the PathNodes or the bot's goal item.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Testing\
      \ Botplay|Testing Botplay]] for techniques to determine bot's goals.\n\n==Related\

      \ Botplay]], this page was meant to be a helpful reference in troubleshooting\
      \ problems with botplay.  The bot motivations are outlined here, the techniques\
      \ for testing botplay are there.  I wouldn't have separated them, personally.\n\
      \n'''amitakartok:''' The bot's aim isn't means where is the crosshair . For\
      \ example, an AVRiL will always hit the intended target regardless of skill\
      \ level and Novice bots in AS-Mothership have the same aiming capabilities as\
      \ a Godlike bot (because the fighter's lasers are ignores all aim modifiers,\
      \ e.g. Auto Aim; bots' aiming probably depends on this kind of modifiers). I\
      \ also repeatedly observed that if the player wasn't visible, only the flying\
      \ drone of his/her SPMA, the first bot seeing it have took it down immediately.\n\
