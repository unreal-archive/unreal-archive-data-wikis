      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> As far as I can tell this technique splits polys but doesn't\
      \ create BSP cuts.</p>\n<p><b>The G.o.a.T:</b> Isn't it better to first substract\
      \ that smaller cube and then add the smaller cube in that substracted space.\
      \ I heard that once and I usually do it that way too&#160;:/</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ subtracting the small cube isn't necessary. The Epic maps add trim brushes\
      \ into solid space.</p>\n<p><b>Birelli:</b> yes, but some of the Epic maps are\
      \ falling apart at the seams. Try rebuilding one and look for some extra BSP\
      \ errors. They are definitely unstable but just made workable for the release.</p>\n\
      <p><b>The G.o.a.T:</b> Looking at the Epic maps ain't such a good idea always.\
      \ There are lots of maps in UT which have messy brushwork, errors (from a technical\
      \ point a view). To name one DM-Deck16][, this map has several errors.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> I haven't had any problems adding into solid space to make\
      \ trim. CliffyB does it &amp; he tends to have good brushwork. We need the l33t\
      \ BSP expertise of ChrisToth on this one.</p>\n<p><b>The G.o.a.T:</b> I always\
      \ make trims with semisolids&#160;;)</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> I generally\
      \ down one of two things to make co-planar trim. The first is to subtract the\
      \ brush then re-add it (keeping it the same size) to make the trim, and the\
      \ second is to use multiple subtractions (use subtracted brushes to create the\
      \ planes) but I tend not to plan far enough ahead to use this one (unless I'm\
      \ building a pit). I've found that smiply adding a brush into solid space will\
      \ give you some nasty HOM effects. I've also had it cause some odd collision\
      \ errors as well.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> The maker of DM-Falkenstein has just\
      \ informed me that he's used this technique in that map with no problems. It\
      \ is, AFAIK a design feature of the engine. (I'll maybe draw up a list of things\
      \ to ask Epic...)</p>\n<p><b>W0RF:</b> One way or the other, subtracting and\
      \ re-adding seems to be less advisable than it used to be. Adding into subtracted\
      \ space that borders The Great Barrier seems to produce HOM at random times.</p>\n\
      <p><b>King Mango</b> Subtracting and then adding in the same shape only adds\
      \ unnecessarily to the complexity of the BSP. If you have problems with sinking,\
      \ it is because of something else in your level.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\n\
