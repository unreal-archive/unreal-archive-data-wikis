      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> No kidding. I started Maya up and it frightenend me so\

      \ who reads this part of the wiki should have basic working knowledge of maya.\
      \ from help &gt;&gt; Library (F1) and at least Chapter One and Two of Instant\
      \ Maya. The movement and layout is intuitive give it a try&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ I'm not sure there's any such thing as \"intuitive\" - except maybe <i>order\

      \ be encouraged and have another go.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Well,\
      \ it was a little less scary this time around, but my goodness me - there's\
      \ so much stuff to remember. I keep trying to move around in Maya in the same\
      \ way as I do in UT, and odd things keep happening. That water mark is intensely\
      \ annoying. I wish they'd made it a little more faint. It makes my eyes go funny\
      \ after a while because I keep thinking it should be occluded by the objects\
      \ I'm editing rather than in front of them. It's probably a perspective thing\
      \ - everything else moves around except the watermark. I really hope the one\
      \ that comes with UT2003 doesn't have it. Still, having managed what I've done\
      \ so far I guess I'll be able to create reasonably simple prefabs in ... oooooh\
      \ ... 3-4 months.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Maya PLE is a 140MB download, so I\
      \ won't have it until UT2003 is released, and even then I'll need to get myself\
      \ a new graphics card – so I'm talking in the dark here, but may I suggest you\
      \ collate jottings on the Maya interface somewhere? I pretty much built up the\

      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> I certainly could do that. The only potential problem\

      \ Had the same trouble, you need to add it to your path variable. Bring up the\
      \ system properties (windows key + pause) goto advanced then enviroment variables.\
      \ add something like the following:</p>\n<p>; C:\\Program Files\\AliasWavefront\\\

      \ the end (basicly unreal and maya need to be in the path variable for some\
      \ strange reason...</p>\n<p><b>MouriceNo1:</b> You need to put the path in there\
      \ so that the Maya plugin can find the UnrealEd and UT2003 exes without having\
      \ to have it set it in Maya.</p>\n<p><b>sandorski:</b> Just wondering if these\

      \ PROBLEM. Using Unreal Tournament 2004, and using maya PLE w. plugin I got\
