      \ protections for the game too. This was my main coding project up until I stopped\
      \ playing Unreal1.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>227 patch:</b> I was contracted\
      \ by Epic (along with Smirftsch from <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\"\
      \ href=\"http://www.OldUnreal.com\">http://www.OldUnreal.com</a>) to work on\
      \ the (to be released) 227 patch for Unreal1, the patch mainly consists of bug\
      \ fixes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>UT2003/UT2004:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Crystal Chaos:</b>\
      \ This was a UT2004 mod entered into the Make Something Unreal Contest, I created\
      \ it's HUD helped with various other small pieces of code.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\
      <li><b>ONSPlus:</b> ONSPlus is an enhancement of the Onslaught gametype released\
      \ with UT2004, it's main focus is bugfixing the gametype and improving the flow\
      \ of gameplay. Many of the bugfixes in this mod were included by Epic in UT2004\
      \ patches.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>TitanTeamFix:</b> TitanTeamFix is a highly\
      \ configurable team balancing mutator for UT2004, I started coding it for the\
      \ Titan servers (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://ut2004.titaninternet.co.uk\"\
      >http://ut2004.titaninternet.co.uk</a>) to replace another less reliable team\
      \ balancing mutator. Recently I have upgraded TitanTeamFix by coding a basic\
      \ UScript SQL Client, it collects and stores player statistics in a MySQL database,\
      \ so as to help balance teams by perceived skill as well as by numbers.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>PortalGun:</b> Inspired by videos of the Nerbacular Drop\
      \ mod for Half-Life2, I initially started work on this as a proof of concept\
      \ that such a weapon could be made in UT2004 and decided to continue work on\
      \ it after getting a lot of positive feedback.&#160;:) I'm still working on\
      \ it at this moment in time (alongside other projects above), I currently have\
      \ it rendering seamless portals as well as having it successfully transport\
      \ vehicles and even weapons fire (including instant-hit fire) through the portal.\
      \ Unfortunately there is no ETA on the release of this project, for reasons\

      \ fixes:</b> Through my experiences with the Unreal Engine I have learned how\
      \ to find, examine, exploit and fix a great variety of weaknesses in the engines\
      \ code. This has led me to contributing to a number of different cheat protections\
      \ and mods (not forgetting offical patches as well) such as Unreal Tournament\
      \ Damage Control (UTDC, UT1), AnthChecker (UT1), Team Arena Master (UT2004),\
      \ UT2004 patch 3355 (I think...I'm credited in latest patch readme anyway) plus\
