      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>The Unreal Tournament 3 Tweaker</i> (UT3T for short)\
      \ has been designed by Brad G, a member of the Unreal community.</p>\n<p><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Unreal_tournament_3?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Unreal tournament 3 (page does not exist)\">Unreal tournament 3</a> is\
      \ renowned for being a highly customizable game by allowing the PC players to\
      \ edit the vast selection of <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Ini_file?redlink=1\" class=\"\
      new\" title=\"Legacy:Ini file (page does not exist)\">ini files</a> which reside\
      \ in the config directory. This however can be confusing to those which are\
      \ not so confident with editing ini files, and with so many tweaks available\
      \ to them it can be time consuming to find the line they are looking for, or\
      \ to know what setting should be applied. UT3T provides the players with a user\
      \ friendly Graphic user interface, allowing them to make a wide variety of changes\
      \ to how the game operates at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>It is freeware. the\
      \ only terms the author has made, is that the application cannot be sold, nor\
      \ can anyone charge for its download.</p>\n<p>3,500 people are using Version\
      \ 5 of UT3T</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changes_UT3T_will_allow_you_to_make\"\

      <p>By using an XBOX controller either wirelessly or connected to a PC via USB,\
      \ UT3T allows you to configure Unreal Tournament 3 to accept the usage of the\
      \ controller, giving you a graphic user interface to setup the <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Key_binding?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Key binding (page does not exist)\">Key Bindings</a>\
      \ for it</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cache_Convertor\">Cache Convertor</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Unreal_Tournament_3_Tweaker?section=4\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Cache Convertor\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>When you connect to an online game of unreal tournament 3, any custom content\
      \ the server is hosting is downloaded to a cache folder on your system, which\
      \ in turn allows you to play the game. This content may include custom levels\
      \ members of the community have designed, or mutators which alter the way the\
      \ game behaves. The problem with this, is that if for example you play a map\
      \ (level) you really enjoyed and would like to play it again, you cannot unless\
      \ you can find a server hosting that map, or you can find it for download on\
      \ the internet. Thats providing you can remember the map's name of course. The\
      \ Cache convertor tool included in the UT3T converts the map files which resiode\
      \ in your cache folder, thus allowing you to play them offline, or to even host\
      \ them yourself.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Browse_server_for_mutators\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Browse server for mutators\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>you can connect to the UT3T\
      \ Server through the application and browse through the mutators listed on there.\
      \ By selecting one a screenshot will be displayed, along with an information\
      \ page. once ticked, you are given the option to download and automatically\
      \ install. once installed it will appear in the uninstall list of the following\
      \ tool.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Manual_installation_of_maps_and_mutators_from_zip_files\"\
      >Manual installation of maps and mutators from zip files</span><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Manual installation of maps and mutators from zip files\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Maps\
      \ and mutators available for the game can contain many files for each one. Mutators\
      \ are more confusing to install, as each of the files have to placed in different\
      \ folders, whereas map files only need to be placed in the \\Published\\CookedPC\\\
      CustomMaps folder.</p>\n<p>UT3T allows you to download maps or mutators as zip\
      \ files in to a folder belonging to the application, and to then simply click\
      \ install. This will unzip the files, and then install them in to the correct\
      \ directories. There is an option to delete the zip files automatically after\
      \ installtion is complete.</p>\n<p>Another feature this tool offers, is the\
      \ ability to uninstall the maps and mutators. They are displayed in a list for\
      \ each type and by selecting the ones you no longer want, they can be removed.\
      \ This saves the burdensome task of visiting multiple directories to remove\
      \ the files manually.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Custom_crosshairs\"\
      >Custom crosshairs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\

      Edit section: Custom crosshairs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The crosshairs of the weapons in the game can be hard\
      \ to adjust to as they are quite large in size. Players of earlier versions\
      \ of the game had greater control over the customizablity of the crosshairs\
      \ which as of UT3 they were limited. UT3T allows you to set different crosshair\
      \ styles for each of the weapons, and it also allows you to change the colour.</p>\n\

      \ Screenshot Manager\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>With the screenshot manager you can easily browse through all of the screenshots\
      \ you have taken ingame, and you are given the option to upload them to a file\
      \ server so you can display them on forums and websites. You have the option\
      \ to delete the ones what your not so keen on, and of course the option to save\
      \ them to JPEG, oppose to the default BMP which the game takes.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ Graphics Manager\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>There are many Graphics tweaks which can be applied, and to many, this can\
      \ be the most confusing.</p>\n<p>There are two preset buttons available which\
      \ one turns the Graphics settings up to the highest possible displaying Detailed\
      \ eye candy, whereas the second turns all of the eye candy off, thus giving\
      \ those with lower spec systems smoother Gameplay.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, all\
      \ of the settings can be adjusted individually by the aid of simple tick boxes.</p>\n\

      \ character to use. by changing his or her muscular build, sex, and clothes.\
      \ UT3T has a few <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Unreal_tournament_3?redlink=1\" class=\"\
      new\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal tournament 3 (page does not exist)\">factions</a>.\
      \ However if you wanted to use a body part from one faction, with a part from\
      \ another you would not be able to. This tool allows you to mix and match body\
      \ parts from different factions to create a truely unique character.</p>\n<h3><span\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Disable Bobbing. The effect you see when moving around\
      \ the game, your weapon bobs up and down. By using this option the weapon will\
      \ not bob as you run making it easier to aim.</p>\n<p>Center your aim. By default\
      \ UT3 does not Aim exactly where your crosshair is. it will be slightly to the\
      \ right if you have it configured to hold your weapon as right handed, and the\
      \ opposite if your holding it with your left hand. This tool will center your\
      \ aim, so you actually hit where your crosshairs are positioned.</p>\n<h3><span\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At the start of the game there are seven movies which\
      \ play advertising different technologies which have been implemented in to\
      \ the game. These can take some time to play through , and can prove irritating\
      \ by having to skip through all of them. This tool allows you to remove them\
      \ from the game, so when it is launched, you appear at the games menu. In addition,\
      \ it grants you the ability to restore them if you so wish to do so.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \n[[Legacy:Unreal_tournament_3|Unreal tournament 3]] is renowned for being a\
      \ highly customizable game by allowing the PC players to edit the vast selection\
      \ of [[Legacy:Ini_file|ini files]] which reside in the config directory. This\
      \ however can be confusing to those which are not so confident with editing\
      \ ini files, and with so many tweaks available to them it can be time consuming\
      \ to find the line they are looking for, or to know what setting should be applied.\
      \ UT3T provides the players with a user friendly Graphic user interface, allowing\
      \ them to make a wide variety of changes to how the game operates at a click\
      \ of a button.\n\nIt is freeware. the only terms the author has made, is that\
      \ the application cannot be sold, nor can anyone charge for its download.\n\n\
      3,500 people are using Version 5 of UT3T\n\n==Changes UT3T will allow you to\
      \ make ==\n\n===XBOX Controller Support===\n\nBy using an XBOX controller either\
      \ wirelessly or connected to a PC via USB, UT3T allows you to configure Unreal\
      \ Tournament 3 to accept the usage of the controller, giving you a graphic user\
      \ interface to setup the [[Legacy:Key_binding|Key Bindings]] for it\n\n===Cache\
      \ Convertor===\n\nWhen you connect to an online game of unreal tournament 3,\
      \ any custom content the server is hosting is downloaded to a cache folder on\
      \ your system, which in turn allows you to play the game. This content may include\
      \ custom levels members of the community have designed, or mutators which alter\
      \ the way the game behaves. The problem with this, is that if for example you\
      \ play a map (level) you really enjoyed and would like to play it again, you\
      \ cannot unless you can find a server hosting that map, or you can find it for\
      \ download on the internet. Thats providing you can remember the map's name\
      \ of course. The Cache convertor tool included in the UT3T converts the map\
      \ files which resiode in your cache folder, thus allowing you to play them offline,\
      \ or to even host them yourself.\n\n===Browse server for mutators===\n\nyou\
      \ can connect to the UT3T Server through the application and browse through\
      \ the mutators listed on there. By selecting one a screenshot will be displayed,\
      \ along with an information page. once ticked, you are given the option to download\
      \ and automatically install. once installed it will appear in the uninstall\
      \ list of the following tool.\n\n===Manual installation of maps and mutators\
      \ from zip files===\n\nMaps and mutators available for the game can contain\
      \ many files for each one. Mutators are more confusing to install, as each of\
      \ the files have to placed in different folders, whereas map files only need\
      \ to be placed in the \\Published\\CookedPC\\CustomMaps folder.\n\nUT3T allows\
      \ you to download maps or mutators as zip files in to a folder belonging to\
      \ the application, and to then simply click install. This will unzip the files,\
      \ and then install them in to the correct directories. There is an option to\
      \ delete the zip files automatically after installtion is complete.\n\nAnother\
      \ feature this tool offers, is the ability to uninstall the maps and mutators.\
      \ They are displayed in a list for each type and by selecting the ones you no\
      \ longer want, they can be removed. This saves the burdensome task of visiting\
      \ multiple directories to remove the files manually.\n\n===Custom crosshairs===\n\
      \nThe crosshairs of the weapons in the game can be hard to adjust to as they\
      \ are quite large in size. Players of earlier versions of the game had greater\
      \ control over the customizablity of the crosshairs which as of UT3 they were\
      \ limited. UT3T allows you to set different crosshair styles for each of the\
      \ weapons, and it also allows you to change the colour.\n\n===Screenshot Manager===\n\
      \nWith the screenshot manager you can easily browse through all of the screenshots\
      \ you have taken ingame, and you are given the option to upload them to a file\
      \ server so you can display them on forums and websites. You have the option\
      \ to delete the ones what your not so keen on, and of course the option to save\
      \ them to JPEG, oppose to the default BMP which the game takes.\n\n===Graphics\
      \ Manager===\n\nThere are many Graphics tweaks which can be applied, and to\
      \ many, this can be the most confusing.\n\nThere are two preset buttons available\
      \ which one turns the Graphics settings up to the highest possible displaying\
      \ Detailed eye candy, whereas the second turns all of the eye candy off, thus\
      \ giving those with lower spec systems smoother Gameplay.\n\nFurthermore, all\
      \ of the settings can be adjusted individually by the aid of simple tick boxes.\n\
      \n===Unlock Body parts===\n\nUT3 like many games allows you to create your own\
      \ character to use. by changing his or her muscular build, sex, and clothes.\
      \ UT3T has a few [[Legacy:Unreal_tournament_3#Teams|factions]]. However if you\
      \ wanted to use a body part from one faction, with a part from another you would\
      \ not be able to. This tool allows you to mix and match body parts from different\
      \ factions to create a truely unique character.\n\n===Other weapon configuration===\n\
      \nDisable Bobbing. The effect you see when moving around the game, your weapon\
      \ bobs up and down. By using this option the weapon will not bob as you run\
      \ making it easier to aim.\n\nCenter your aim. By default UT3 does not Aim exactly\
      \ where your crosshair is. it will be slightly to the right if you have it configured\
      \ to hold your weapon as right handed, and the opposite if your holding it with\
      \ your left hand. This tool will center your aim, so you actually hit where\
      \ your crosshairs are positioned.\n\n===Movie removal===\n\nAt the start of\
      \ the game there are seven movies which play advertising different technologies\
      \ which have been implemented in to the game. These can take some time to play\
      \ through , and can prove irritating by having to skip through all of them.\
      \ This tool allows you to remove them from the game, so when it is launched,\
      \ you appear at the games menu. In addition, it grants you the ability to restore\
      \ them if you so wish to do so.\n\n===Change the language of the game===\n\n\
      UT3T will allow you to change the language of the game to either\n\nEnglish\n\
      \nFrench\n\nItalian\n\nGerman\n\nSpanish\n\nRussian\n\n===Backup/Restore===\n\
      \nThis allows you to make backups of all of your ini files before you begin\
      \ tweaking. This way if you do make a mistake theres no reason to worry. simply\
      \ restore the file.\n\n==History==\n\nDevelopment began in december 2007 when\
      \ Brad G released a tool which would allow you to remove the videos from the\
      \ start of the game. After realising there was interest from the community for\
      \ software which would enable them to tweak the game, he began to add new features\
      \ to the tool.\n\nOn Thursday, February 21, 2008 Version 5 of the UT3T was released,\
      \ which is the current version.\n\n==Download Link==\n\nThe file may be downloaded\
