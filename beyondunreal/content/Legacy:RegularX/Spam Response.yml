      \ because it somehow got published on the net, and I ended up receiving about\
      \ 2500 spam messages totalling more than 5mb each week. Creators of spam and\
      \ viruses should be shot.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> My beyondunreal mailbox gets\
      \ tons and TONS of spam.&#160;:( I suggest people use their Wiki personal page\
      \ as a contact point.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> On a more positive note, I assure\
      \ you that current anti-spam software along with a few custom filtering rules\
      \ (to sort out bounces and <b>auto-responses</b>) does a great job keeping a\
      \ spam-ridden account clean on user side.</p>\n<p>I've been using one of my\
      \ email addresses – michael.buschbeck@physik.tu-muenchen.de – for more than\
      \ six years now, actively spreading it in Usenet newsgroups and in the web,\
      \ and it gets tons of spam, worms, and misguided bounces and auto-responses\
      \ (I'm counting 5010 pieces of unsoliticed email so far since 2004-06-01); yet\
      \ I see about one piece of spam per week actually coming through.</p>\n<p>Actually,\
      \ from a look into my (slightly mis-named) \"Spam\" folder which receives all\
      \ filtered email I see that the number of actual spam and worms is in fact dwarfed\
      \ by the amount of <b>misguided delivery status notifications,</b> <b>virus\
      \ scanner bounces,</b> <b>auto-responses</b> and (of late) <b>confirmation requests</b>\
      \ along the lines of \"If the email you sent me is not spam, please confirm.\"\
      </p>\n<p>The senders of spam and the creators of worms are scum (and <i>stupid</i>\
      \ scum at that) – we've known that for a while, and there are ways to deal with\
      \ it. However, people who set up their virus scanners and email accounts to\
      \ send auto-responses and confirmation requests to the <i>unvalidated</i> \"\
      From\" addresses of email they receive are only worsening the problem because\
      \ the fact that I'm getting tons of auto-responses and bounces which were never\
      \ meant for me has made me set up blanket filters for those message types.</p>\n\
      <p>So, if I sent an email to inkless@inkless.com, I'd never read RegularX's\
      \ auto-response. I can deal with spam and worms because they're comparatively\
      \ easy to discern and filter, but the fact that I have to filter email sent\
      \ to me by <i>normal</i> people in (assumedly) good faith is really troubling\
      \ me – <i>that</i> is what's really interfering with proper operation of email.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> By the way: I suggest you remove the reference to inkless@inkless.com\
      \ from your contact page since it only redirects back to the contact page anyway...\
      \ &#160;:-)</p>\n<p><b>Plouj</b> Why don't you use a yahoo account? Its free,\
      \ it gives you 100MB of space, it FILTERS your spam, it scans virus, it does\
      \ NOT include spam in the 100MB of space, and it lets you send/receive up to\
      \ 10MB mails.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Me? I'm very happy with my current account,\
      \ as detailed above. I'm running my own mail server, so there's little I cannot\
      \ do. Yahoo cannot solve the problem I outlined above either – it's not related\
      \ to anything I or anybody else could do, except for those <i>sending</i> auto-responses,\
      \ virus warnings and bounces. (And whoever sends 10 MB emails needs to be shot\
      \ anyway.)</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b> Think he meant me - Plouj was an unfortunate\
      \ recipient of the anti-spam curse. Again, apologies Plouj - though something\
      \ sent inkless an email from your account - though it may very, very well not\
      \ have been you. I think I've gotten 20 different emails from eXor I'm sure\
      \ he doesn't know about...</p>\n<p>As for yahoo - there are two reasons I don't.\
      \ 1) Yahoo accounts get more spam than almost any other account out there, they\
      \ just hide it better. 2) Yahoo accounts are the cause of a good deal of spam,\
      \ and I don't want to go near that. This might sound a bit more theoretical\
      \ than practical, but once someone had gotten to the levels of spam I had -\
      \ theory is good practice. I'm using hush now - which has the main strength\
      \ of securing all of it's communications, which eliminates some of the man in\
      \ the middle exploits spammers use. Plus they have the best \"tear off\" accounts\
      \ I've seen to date, meaning I can abandon email addresses I give to mailing\
      \ lists or stores easily.</p>\n<p>I think I tried every form of anti-spam software\
      \ out there, aside from being able to administer my own mail server - which\
      \ will indeed slow down the progress. But, in short review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Filters:</i>\
      \ Worked great for about two months. Spammers, like the virus nature they emulate,\
      \ alter their configuration constantly. Filters simply aren't up to the task\
      \ to keep up, and I ended up still hand filtering out new spam. Naturally if\
      \ you make your filter too broad, you end up with the danger of filtering out\
      \ good email - and I ended up deleting more than a few of those. This, to me,\
      \ is the biggest crime of spamming. I lost lots of normal communication due\
      \ to my efforts to clean out my own inbox.</li>\n<li><i>Blacklists:</i> Basically\
      \ an ultra-filter. Nearly impossible to get above 90% accuracy, which is one\
      \ thing when you get 100 pieces of spam weekly, but hourly it gets a bit nuts.</li>\n\
      <li><i>Whitelists:</i> Worked perfectly longer than any other method. However,\
      \ as time went on it took people longer and longer to get the challenge-response\
      \ email and I was losing out on correspondance. And finally, spammers get human\
      \ leeches to respond to the challenge and then they get through to your inbox.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>For worsening the problem - I don't really have a choice but to put\
      \ up an auto-responder. I've had this email for almost a decade. People I've\
      \ known since I first got onto the internet (and I'm one of those 'used Mosaic'\
      \ types) know this account. It's simply not possible for me notify everyone.\
      \ The first week I put up the auto responder I got five emails through the contact\
      \ form, and I've gotten them on and off since. I could try to get to the \"\
      validated\" email address, but it would take a much more complicated responder,\
      \ obviously. I think I'd rather update it so that people who get the message\
      \ might know someone is sending emails in their name (which should really be\
      \ a crime as well). Perhaps some month I'll abandon it completely - but I also\
      \ somewhat like cursing the spam industry. It's about the only recourse that\
      \ email addy has left. And yeah, there are few more references to inkless@inkless.com\
      \ I need to remove.</p>\n<p>I will admit - the \"pay out of pocket\" is a bit\
      \ misleading... I could get a free email easily - but I mention it to simply\
      \ question an untrue fact about spam - that it costs the reciever nothing. It\
      \ cost me in bandwidth, in storage, in time, and in loss of contact with business\
      \ relations. Spam cost me plenty. I'd love to sue someone - but there's nobody\
      \ to sue. I chose to spend a bit as an investment to avoid it in the future.</p>\n\
      <p>There's no doubt in my mind that all these people should go to jail. How\
      \ would the IRS feel if I neglected to file my returns because I accidentally\
      \ tossed out my tax records with the 1,000 \"Better Rates!!\" offers I got in\
      \ the mail that day? Or how would a store owner feel if I walked around handing\
      \ out pictures of nude girls to everyone in his store, regardless of age? It's\
      \ ludicrous, but until either lawmakers wake up to the amount of damage it's\
      \ really doing or the internet gets a tech upgrade, it's what it is.</p>\n<p><b>Plouj:</b>\
      \ Hahahah, forward crap to spaminklessnow@yahoo.com</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b>\
      \ here's a very usefull hint, most virii and email spiders filter email adresses\
      \ that contain the word <i>spam</i>. So create an email address like <i>spam@yourdomain.com</i>,\
      \ and always write it as <i>SPAM@yourdomain.com (yes, this address is correct)</i>.\
      \ An other hint is to convert everybody you know to drop Outlook, and learn\
      \ them how to use a thing called <i>e-mail</i>: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external free\" href=\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1855.html\">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1855.html</a></p>\n\
      <p>Here's an other interesting thing, I have quite some email addresses, some\
      \ are over 7 years old others I don't use. But the interesting thing is, I have\
      \ the email address <i>michiel@...</i> and <i>elmuerte@...</i>, the later is\
      \ an alias of the first (so it's transparent), I always use the <i>emuerte@...</i>\
      \ address. But I only receive spam on <i>michiel@...</i> and hardly any on <i>elmuerte@...</i>.\
      \ I do receive quite some virrii on the elmuerte address.</p>\n<p>Also note\
      \ that using an email address like <i>mydowmain@mydomain.com</i> is just asking\
      \ for spam, one of my addresses is like that and I never ever used it but I\
      \ do receive spam. I started receiving spam about 1 month after I registered\
      \ that domain, it didn't even have a website or anything.</p>\n<p><b>Radiosity:</b>\
      \ I know all about that domain @ domain.com one. My secondary domain (which\
      \ thankfully expires in October) has a default address that I can't delete.\
      \ Can you guess how much spam it receives in an average week? Getting on for\
      \ 15mb. I have to log into my ftp and delete the inbox file more or less daily\
      \ to keep my space free for stuff I actually <b>want</b>.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b>\
      \ well inkless @ inkless.com was created back in the innocent days on the net\
      \ when people used email to communicate. And actually the username came before\
      \ the domain ( I used my ISP's domain for a couple months before getting inkless.com\
      \ ). And while spam is annoying, virii actually caused the most damage - because\
      \ they get compounded with Outlook, and that gets me with all these address\
      \ lists I'm apparently on, and then I would get like 20 10MB attachments in\
      \ a half hour. The net really has turned into a sewer if you wander out too\
      \ far. I'm hoping using NYM addresses publically and keeping the hush account\
      \ mostly silent to avoid any real spam leaking in for at least a couple of years.\
      \ If that fails, I'll probably just turn into some net recluse that only responds\
      \ to people who hack into a secure IRC server...</p>\n<p><b>LegalAssassin:</b>\
      \ Does anyone actually buy ANYTHING of what's \"advertised\" (that word should\
      \ be used for the honorable leeches infesting TV, radio and newspapers only)\
      \ in spam mails? Really, how often does anyone pay for \"herb medecin\", \"\
      super viagra\", porn sites and other random crap. There's obviously a market,\
      \ otherwise spammers wouldn't keep at it.</p>\n<p>I suggest you shoot anyone\
      \ you know even might consider buying spam offers or anyone actually spamming.\
      \ That way there's no market, no spamming, and the rest of us can live without\
      \ the scum infestation.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b> The problem is that is costs\
      \ a spammer roughly the same to send 1,000,000 emails as it does to send 100\
      \ - which means if only 1% of their \"audience\" (that word is usually meant\
      \ as in voluntary though) responds, it's easy to ramp up the numbers to make\
      \ it more profitable. And then spammers use that as excuse - well, clearly people\
      \ want the herbal viagra, four people out of 3 million bought a bottle last\
      \ week. Naturally, it's inversely costly for the receiver, which is where it\
      \ should be easy to make it illegal, if our lawmakers weren't stuck in the era\
      \ of fax machines to realize it (laws exist to block fax ads for just that reason).</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> There's actually an interesting reason behind why lawyers\
      \ and politicians use fax machines instead of computers. A faxed signed document\
      \ is considered legally valid, while one scanned, e-mailed, and then printed\
      \ is not.&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b> Sure, sure - but I bet the more common\
      \ reason is that they don't need their secretaries to log into the fax machine\
      \ for them.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> a fax isn't legal at all, but they do\
      \ accept it as legally valid. You can consider anything legal if both parties\
      \ agree on that (unless ofcourse it's prohibited by law), and both sign a document\
      \ stating they accept the method (otherwise there's no record that both parties\
      \ agree). Some people even acknowldge EULA's as legally valid.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ Hmm, it was my understanding that a faxed document was as valid as the original.\
      \ Perhaps it varies with country, though.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\n\

      \ their name (which should really be a crime as well). Perhaps some month I'll\
      \ abandon it completely - but I also somewhat like cursing the spam industry.\
      \  It's about the only recourse that email addy has left.  And yeah, there are\
      \ few more references to inkless@inkless.com I need to remove.\n\nI will admit\
      \ - the \"pay out of pocket\" is a bit misleading... I could get a free email\
      \ easily - but I mention it to simply question an untrue fact about spam - that\
      \ it costs the reciever nothing.  It cost me in bandwidth, in storage, in time,\
      \ and in loss of contact with business relations.  Spam cost me plenty.  I'd\
      \ love to sue someone - but there's nobody to sue.  I chose to spend a bit as\
      \ an investment to avoid it in the future.\n\nThere's no doubt in my mind that\
      \ all these people should go to jail.  How would the IRS feel if I neglected\
      \ to file my returns because I accidentally tossed out my tax records with the\
      \ 1,000 \"Better Rates!!\" offers I got in the mail that day?  Or how would\
      \ a store owner feel if I walked around handing out pictures of nude girls to\
      \ everyone in his store, regardless of age?  It's ludicrous, but until either\
      \ lawmakers wake up to the amount of damage it's really doing or the internet\
      \ gets a tech upgrade, it's what it is.\n\n'''Plouj:''' Hahahah, forward crap\
      \ to spaminklessnow@yahoo.com\n\n'''El Muerte:''' here's a very usefull hint,\
      \ most virii and email spiders filter email adresses that contain the word ''spam''.\
      \ So create an email address like ''spam@yourdomain.com'', and always write\
      \ it as ''SPAM@yourdomain.com (yes, this address is correct)''. An other hint\
      \ is to convert everybody you know to drop Outlook, and learn them how to use\
      \ a thing called ''e-mail'': http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1855.html\n\nHere's\
      \ an other interesting thing, I have quite some email addresses, some are over\
      \ 7 years old others I don't use. But the interesting thing is, I have the email\
      \ address ''michiel@...'' and ''elmuerte@...'', the later is an alias of the\
      \ first (so it's transparent), I always use the ''emuerte@...'' address. But\
      \ I only receive spam on ''michiel@...'' and hardly any on ''elmuerte@...''.\
      \ I do receive quite some virrii on the elmuerte address. \n\nAlso note that\
      \ using an email address like ''mydowmain@mydomain.com'' is just asking for\
      \ spam, one of my addresses is like that and I never ever used it but I do receive\
      \ spam. I started receiving spam about 1 month after I registered that domain,\
      \ it didn't even have a website or anything.\n\n'''Radiosity:''' I know all\
      \ about that domain @ domain.com one. My secondary domain (which thankfully\
      \ expires in October) has a default address that I can't delete. Can you guess\
      \ how much spam it receives in an average week? Getting on for 15mb. I have\
      \ to log into my ftp and delete the inbox file more or less daily to keep my\
      \ space free for stuff I actually '''want'''.\n\n'''RegularX:''' well inkless\
      \ @ inkless.com was created back in the innocent days on the net when people\
      \ used email to communicate.  And actually the username came before the domain\
      \ ( I used my ISP's domain for a couple months before getting inkless.com ).\
      \ And while spam is annoying, virii actually caused the most damage - because\
      \ they get compounded with Outlook, and that gets me with all these address\
      \ lists I'm apparently on, and then I would get like 20 10MB attachments in\
      \ a half hour.  The net really has turned into a sewer if you wander out too\
      \ far. I'm hoping using NYM addresses publically and keeping the hush account\
      \ mostly silent to avoid any real spam leaking in for at least a couple of years.\
      \   If that fails, I'll probably just turn into some net recluse that only responds\
      \ to people who hack into a secure IRC server...\n\n'''LegalAssassin:''' Does\
      \ anyone actually buy ANYTHING of what's \"advertised\" (that word should be\
      \ used for the honorable leeches infesting TV, radio and newspapers only) in\
      \ spam mails? Really, how often does anyone pay for \"herb medecin\", \"super\
      \ viagra\", porn sites and other random crap. There's obviously a market, otherwise\
      \ spammers wouldn't keep at it.\n\nI suggest you shoot anyone you know even\
      \ might consider buying spam offers or anyone actually spamming. That way there's\
      \ no market, no spamming, and the rest of us can live without the scum infestation.\n\
      \n'''RegularX:''' The problem is that is costs a spammer roughly the same to\
      \ send 1,000,000 emails as it does to send 100 - which means if only 1% of their\
      \ \"audience\" (that word is usually meant as in voluntary though) responds,\
      \ it's easy to ramp up the numbers to make it more profitable.  And then spammers\
      \ use that as excuse - well, clearly people want the herbal viagra, four people\
      \ out of 3 million bought a bottle last week.  Naturally, it's inversely costly\
      \ for the receiver, which is where it should be easy to make it illegal, if\
      \ our lawmakers weren't stuck in the era of fax machines to realize it (laws\
      \ exist to block fax ads for just that reason).\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' There's actually\
      \ an interesting reason behind why lawyers and politicians use fax machines\
      \ instead of computers. A faxed signed document is considered legally valid,\
      \ while one scanned, e-mailed, and then printed is not. :D\n\n'''RegularX:'''\
      \ Sure, sure - but I bet the more common reason is that they don't need their\
      \ secretaries to log into the fax machine for them.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' a fax\
      \ isn't legal at all, but they do accept it as legally valid. You can consider\
      \ anything legal if both parties agree on that (unless ofcourse it's prohibited\
      \ by law), and both sign a document stating they accept the method (otherwise\
      \ there's no record that both parties agree). Some people even acknowldge EULA's\
      \ as legally valid.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Hmm, it was my understanding that a faxed\
      \ document was as valid as the original. Perhaps it varies with country, though."
