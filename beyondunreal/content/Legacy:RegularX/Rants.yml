      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Yeah, this is a\
      \ common rant - I'm ranting on it again. Not just strictly on beta vs alpha\
      \ vs production, but what people actually put out when they say \"this mod is\
      \ released!\" - because frequently, it's really not. And at this point I don't\
      \ really care if it's got \"alpha\" or \"beta\" or \"gamma\" next to it - unless\
      \ you specifically state that you are only sending your work out for playtesting\
      \ purposes - I'm considering it playworthy code. The mod community has pretty\
      \ much killed all such terms as anything informational.</p>\n<p>In no particular\
      \ order, here are my big pet peeves when I finally try to play someone's release:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li><b>No umod version.</b> I like umods. Not everyone likes them. A lot\
      \ of people do. I don't really want to care about trying to decipher your zipped\
      \ folder structure. I like pressing three buttons and being done with it.</li>\n\
      <li><b>Evil umod version.</b> I don't want any of your mod's installation to\
      \ be present when I play normal UT other than selecting gametypes and options\
      \ like I normally would.</li>\n<li><b>No zipped version.</b> Yeah. You should\
      \ do both. What? It's a pain? Tough.</li>\n<li><b>Evil zipped version.</b> Once\
      \ I extract the zip, I should be done. Yes, it's a bit more work to setup a\
      \ folder structure that will easily extract to say, the UT2003 directory. Guess\
      \ what? Tough. It's a bit more work for you upfront rather than more work everytime\
      \ someone downloads your files.</li>\n<li><b>Unrelated files.</b> If it doesn't\
      \ have anything to do with your work, installing your work and playing your\
      \ work, then it doesn't belong in the archive. You might think that UberTool2003\
      \ works great with your mod and want everyone to have it. Fab. Except for this\
      \ thing called version control. Unless you plan on updating all the possible\
      \ archives that hold your version, UberTool2003's version will be static. That\
      \ means if I had a new UberTool2003 on my drive when I installed your mod, I\
      \ just unwittingly reverted or broke my version. Thanks. Don't do that.</li>\n\
      <li><b>Lack of related files.</b> I can't count the number of times I've downloaded\
      \ something, installed it, and have absolutely no clue as to what's going on.\
      \ Maybe something needs to be bound, or maybe I need to update an ini - but\
      \ I won't know if you won't tell me. Make sure all the information someone needs\
      \ to play your work is included when they download it. If I don't RTFM, that's\
      \ my fault. If you don't ITFM, that's yours.</li>\n<li><b>Known bug.</b> This\
      \ is a pretty minor pet peeve, and I'm pretty certain I've been guilty of it\
      \ - but known bugs should be included in the above, particularly if they are\
      \ serious (like ... bots don't work at all...)</li>\n<li><b>Whoops! Here's the\
      \ new version!!</b> Whoops! You should have playtested it! Yes I know this is\
      \ in part because the number of people really willing to help test things can\
      \ be generally counted on one paw. I know some things are just unforseen. Stuff\
      \ happens. Here's what else - if I just downloaded 50MB of data only to see\
      \ that it's been replaced two days later by another 50MB of \"fixed\" data -\
      \ I'm not only unlikely to download the new version, I'm unlikely to ever trust\
      \ downloading that data again. And finally, to be completely recursive...</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li><b>It's just a beta.</b> As stated. If you wanted me to test\
      \ your work, you should have asked.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Half of these could be fixed\
      \ just by using <a href=\"/Legacy:Umod_Wizard\" title=\"Legacy:Umod Wizard\"\
      >Umod Wizard</a>, the other half are just courtesy.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>I think it's seriously time for mods to get back to\
      \ their roots - and by that I mean the root of the word \"mod\". Lately I've\
      \ seen more up and coming modsters and even a few trade rags start referring\
      \ mods as \"MODS\" as if they've suddenly become too large for lowercasing.</p>\n\
      <p>Look, mods are \"modifications\" that's where the word comes from - it's\
      \ where it's always come from. Lately people, and the Unreal community especially,\
      \ have grown to think that mods aren't really a hobby or a past-time, aren't\
      \ really fun additions that they get for free and should take with a grain of\
      \ salt, and aren't really modifications. Many people seem to expect that all\
      \ mods are going to be Counter-Strike or Tactical Ops.</p>\n<p>Let's get this\
      \ straight. Counter-Strike took <b>years</b> of development. It's current form\
      \ has been modified by <b>teams of professionals</b>. In it's initial form,\
      \ it was messy. it was hacky. It had exactly one model for all the players and\
      \ two skins. It had maybe a fifth of the weapons it does today. Defusion hadn't\
      \ even been thought of yet and half the time the scientist seem to hate you\
      \ for rescuing them.</p>\n<p>People liked it because it was sufficiently different\
      \ from what they had been playing. The community started poking at it, playing\
      \ it, forming opinons about it, offering suggestions, etc. CS's desire to \"\
      stay in beta\" was a reflection of this ongoing discussion about the game itself.</p>\n\
      <p>However, if a mod in CS's initial state were released this weekend, I'm guessing\
      \ most current players would download it, play it for a few hours, find some\
      \ things they don't like about it, complain, and stop playing it within a week.\
      \ I'm guessing this because it seems to have happened several times after Phase\
      \ 1 of the MSUC.</p>\n<p>Now we have people offering promotion services for\
      \ mod teams, mod teams contacting lawyers - and NOT because they got a cease\
      \ and desist letter, mods worrying about trade secrets, etc. etc. There's virtually\
      \ no beta testing or playtesting undercurrent among Unreal players - they pretty\
      \ much expect a beta to be a complete version (partially because many mod teams\
      \ \"release\" their beta versions). Where does all of this seem to be leading\
      \ us? Mod teams trying to be more like professional dev teams isn't precisely\
      \ a bad thing - except...</p>\n<p>Mods were once part of the cutting edge of\
      \ game development. CTF, Bombing Run, Inventory control, money based systems,\
      \ class based systems - all of these have footholds in mod developments. With\
      \ mod teams worrying about how \"commercially\" viable their \"product\" is\
      \ to a player base that is starting to expect \"professional\" content - it\
      \ seems to be dying away. And it's turning into a lose-lose situation. Mod teams\
      \ will have to expend more time and money to make better content while players\
      \ are going to less content and less innovation.</p>\n<p>So what can be done\
      \ about it? We have to get back to the grass roots of it all - a shared community\
      \ when it comes to developing, testing, playing, forming opinions. Public interest\
      \ in mods has to go beyond just expecting CS2. Mod interest has to go beyond\
      \ trying to make CS2.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rant_3:_Seriously._Stop_with_the_MOD_crap.\"\

      \ don't put in caps because it's short for modification. Unless you cap FRANK\

      \ think, l33t. Even if it was, l33t got annoying about 2 years ago.</li>\n<li>It\
      \ makes the person typing it look juvenile and instantly makes me uncaring about\
      \ anything they have to say after. I prefer to not care about something for\
      \ better reasons, but I've decided that this one will do as well.</li>\n<li>Finally,\
      \ it makes mods in general look juvenile and silly. I have a hard enough time\
      \ convincing people that this hobby isn't just for 15 year olds without this\
      \ nonsense. If you can't bring attention to your project without using caps\
      \ lock, then just don't bother the rest of us with it. The only game in the\
      \ history of gaming to get a reprieve from this is DOOM, so if you don't work\

      \ hardware arrived yesterday. My plan, as some of you know, was to have the\
      \ basics of a new box built for me - mboard, vid card, hard drive and OS. Then\
      \ I was going to slowly put the pieces of my old computer back in.</p>\n<p>Step\
      \ 1 - get the new computer onto the internet, this way I could access tech help\
      \ and drivers as I needed it. Step 1 worked fine. Put in some stuff for net\
      \ connections, bam - there was google.com.</p>\n<p>Step 2 - put the old HD in.\
      \ This was the big one, it had all my old work/code on it. I had to swap it\
      \ to be the secondary and had an awful scare when I found an empty UT2003 folder,\
      \ but then I realized where there right partition was and bam, data saved.</p>\n\
      <p>Step 3 - install old CDRom drive, so that I could get software on the beast.\
      \ No problem. Bing bam, CDROM.</p>\n<p>Step 4 - install Radeon 9700. This would\
      \ complete the box and turn it into one hell of a rig. No problems. The card\
      \ I had them put in was also an ATI, so the drivers just woke up to the new\
      \ card.</p>\n<p>Seemingly victorious, I danced around for a bit and then proceeded\
      \ to download various programs like Mozilla and Winamp, etc.</p>\n<p>Then disaster.</p>\n\
      <p>Windows froze.</p>\n<p>Hard Drive failed. Disk Read Error.</p>\n<p>Computer\
      \ gone. For well over an hour I swapped drives, fumbled cables, tried one tiny\
      \ change or another - but I seemed trapped between the new HD having a disk\
      \ read error, my old hard drive being lost in the new board and throwing a blue\
      \ screen, and the CDROM refusing to be boot.</p>\n<p>Feeling defeated, I emailed\
      \ the guys who put it together and almost went to bed (about 1AM now). Just\
      \ for kicks, I poked around a bit on google to see what others had done.</p>\n\
      <p>Took me a bit, but I got the BIOS to boot the CDROM first, put my old HD\
      \ in as primary (the new one wasn't even seen by the BIOS now) and put the XP\
      \ install disk. Repair, repair, install, install. Thank GOD Sony decided to\
      \ partition that old computer, because I could do all this knowing my lovely\
      \ code was relatively safe on the second half.</p>\n<p>Over an hour later, Windows\
      \ XP booted up. Then I had to teach my old OS (after having to call Microsoft\
      \ to explain to them why I was now re-activating the same XP CD again ... I\
      \ had forgot they added this - it really, really sucks) to see the motherboard's\
      \ ethernet card and the new sound card (an SB Audigy - dang, I'll never go back\
      \ to onboard sound again).</p>\n<p>After pushing the Far Cry demo around for\
      \ a bit, I set up the UT2004 demo to download and went to bed. Time of now seeming\
      \ victory: 4AM.</p>\n<p>In the morning, the computer had restarted itself.</p>\n\
      <p>I tried to redownload the demo, it told me the RPC service had died and it\
      \ was going to restart itself anyway.</p>\n<p>Yup that's right.</p>\n<p>After\
      \ all that. I have a virus. A little research and my guess is that I've had\
      \ this virus since about November, but my firewall kept it from doing any harm.\
      \ When the OS repaired, Tiny reset it's setup, I accidentally permitted some\
      \ bizarre request and it awoke.</p>\n<p>So after many hours of labor - I have\
      \ a new computer, an old virus and an 80GB paperweight.</p>\n<p>Thankfully Microsoft\
      \ has reissued an update, and I can teach Tiny how to kill Blaster again while\
      \ I fix it. Should be OK by this weekend. The paperweight's fate is unknown.</p>\n\

      \ third in the MSUC Phase 2. Lower than I hoped, but I'm glad to be in good\
      \ company with mods like Seismic and Flag Dom, not to mention Rocketeer. There's\
      \ a real old school feel to the gametype contenders which I'm glad to be nudged\
      \ into.</p>\n<p>What I think is curious is Steve (o' Epic) Polge's response\
      \ for feedback on old RW. Now, I conditionalize this by saying I don't totally\
      \ disagree with Steve and am glad to get <i>any</i> feedback from the pro crowd.</p>\n\
      <p><i>\"Riftwar: Cool ideas, but really deserves to become a TC [total conversion].\
      \ Too grand a scope for a gametype with no custom art to make it feel more different.\
      \ Scoreboard needs to be improved.\"</i></p>\n<p>This pokes into the heart of\
      \ why Riftwar <i>isn't</i> a TC. And probably never will be. Riftwar was developed\
      \ while I was working on a TC (the now defunct Freehold NG) as a prototype of\
      \ a specific gametype. To test some of the mechanics of three team gameplay,\
      \ it was a pretty conscious decision not to make rely on the code or design\
      \ of the TC. I wanted a clean box to play with the concepts and that meant working\
      \ off of Epic's assets. The class based system was essentially another prototype\
      \ slapped onto that one in order to work around some of the issues of selecting\
      \ teams and team skins. As Riftwar started to get a life of it's own, the idea\
      \ to try adding persistence to it was more or less another expirement to the\
      \ pile, but it was also to try and elevate the gameplay so that players actually\
      \ felt like they were in a war, not just chasing glowy things. And so, I can\
      \ see a bit of Steve's point - Riftwar's notion of classes and persistence seem\
      \ more like a seperate game, not just a gametype.</p>\n<p>Or do they? Should\
      \ they? At what point should a gametype be considered too large for it's shoes?\
      \ Onslaught is pretty grand for a gametype - large, expansive maps, completely\
      \ new vehicle code, new weapons, new conventions. If someone made a mutator\
      \ to add persistent campaigns to ONS, would that mean that ONS should instantly\
      \ also get new player pawns and a different HUD?</p>\n<p>Now, I'll admit that\
      \ lack of custom art definately hurts Riftwar - reusing models for alternate\
      \ weapons isn't ideal for the game or the player (another point to hopefully\
      \ be addressed ... or worked around ... in the next version), but once again\
      \ using the ONS analogy - I don't think a few new weapon models should instantly\
      \ mean that it needs to try and be a whole new game.</p>\n<p>The problem is,\
      \ I think, that this minutia is getting lost in the glorification of total conversions\
      \ as the only real goal for mods. This is evident in Epic's scaling of the MSUC\
      \ prize money. Large purse money makes sense for TC projects - they're large,\
      \ have lots of people and consume enormous resources to get playable versions\
      \ up and running. More mysterious is why the vehicle category is rewarded over\
      \ 3 times that of the gametype category. Does a truck add three times more value\
      \ to playing Unreal than say, a completely new way to play Unreal? It's hard\
      \ to see that. Yes, yes, many of us are glad that the gametype category got\
      \ added at all - but then it's a head scratcher as to why a (also added later)\
      \ single phase of Assault Maps is worth more than all the phases of gametypes\
      \ combined.</p>\n<p>If Onslaught had been entered as an entry into the Make\
      \ Something Unreal Contest, the HellBender would have been worth more than the\
      \ game itself.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it goes back to why gametypes simply got voiceovers\
      \ in the MSUC Phase 1 video review - they're hard to visualize. Without custom\
      \ art and assets, there's not much in the way of eye candy screenshots to show\
      \ off. While the MSUC is an amazing gift to the mod and player community - it's\
      \ also a promotional device. Gametype style mods generally go for gameplay first,\
      \ look and feel second. It really is an old school tradition - one that is more\
      \ Threewave CTF than Counter-Strike in terms of developing mods. While nobody\
      \ can argue the value that the latter has given companies like Valve, perhaps\
      \ it's not a good idea to forget the value that the former gave to companies\
      \ like id and Epic. Where would Unreal Tournament have been without a good game\
      \ of CTF-Face?</p>\n<p>I shrug. This isn't really a complaint or rant, just\
      \ a reflection. It seems like there are more games out there that aren't pushing\
      \ the envelope of gameplay - what is Doom 3 shipping with for the PC? Deathmatch?\
      \ Team Deathmatch? Half-Life 2? CTF? It's all stuff we've seen before, and it\
      \ will be left up to the mod communities to try and change that. That, however,\
      \ won't happen if everyone is busy developing a Counter-Strike, not a CTF.</p>\n\
      <p>And yes. The scoreboard for Riftwar does, indeed, suck.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ This usually leaves me looking for something new.</p>\n<p>I came to realize\
      \ that FPS modding as a game development base has a few detractions. One - you\
      \ get really stuck thinking in 3D. I even had someone send me a link to a java\
      \ game, some simple 2D block thing and I instantly thought \"this would be really\
      \ cool in 3D with 4 people!\"</p>\n<p>That's just wrong.</p>\n<p>Clearly I had\
      \ forgotten how elegant a good 2D game can be. Sure, we all like a slick polygonal\
      \ figure, but look at some of the 2D fighting games which survive - some are\
      \ just slick, fast and fun. I don't think there's any standard in which someone\
      \ can say that 3D is simply better. 2D can be more distinct, faster and colorful\
      \ than 3D.</p>\n<p>There's another angle to it, though, that I've started to\
      \ find attractive. Getting an asset into Unreal can take up to 3 people. A concept\
      \ artist to design it, a 3D artist to model it, and a 2D artist to texture it.\
      \ And that's naturally not including an animator, sound guy and coder. 2D could\
      \ much more easily be handled just by one, or maybe two people. As the FPS engines\
      \ get more and more sophisticated, this production cost is only going to be\
      \ increasing (see <a href=\"/Legacy:The_Curse_Of_Static_Meshes\" title=\"Legacy:The\
      \ Curse Of Static Meshes\">The Curse of Static Meshes</a> ).</p>\n<p>If there\
      \ was a really sophisticated 2D game engine, on the order of the Unreal or Quake\
      \ engine, an entire game could be done with about 3 people. Artist, Coder, Musician.\
      \ Compare to the what, 30 people that inhabit mod teams these days?</p>\n<p>Maybe\
      \ as people are converting the UE into a side-scrolling or topview engine with\
      \ 3D assets, we should also look at a framework for sprite control which could\
      \ re-introduce 2D into the mainstream.</p>\n<p>Maybe. But for now I have a porch\
      \ covered in boxen.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rant_7:_A_Mod_By_Any_Other_Name\"\

      >originally on my blog</a>.</p>\n<p>So, I'm reading EGM last night and they\
      \ have this interview with one of the guys responsible for Halo 2. Now I've\
      \ got nothing against Halo 2, liked Halo 1, plan on playing the sequel sometime\
      \ somehow and I've got respect for anyone responsible for that series (not to\
      \ mention Marathon). I've complained in the past about Bungie hyping the hell\
      \ out of Halo before it was really even a game, and then selling it off to Microsoft,\
      \ but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.</p>\n<p>But this guy, and I'm sorry\
      \ that I don't have the article in front of me, but this guy was talking about\
      \ a \"lost\" gametype - Headhunter. In Headhunter, when you kill someone, you\
      \ get a skull. You can take this skull to a dropoff to get frags. People can\
      \ kill you and steal your skulls.</p>\n<p>Sound familiar? It should. It was\
      \ an old Quake mod, relatively shortly after the days of Zoid CTF. Sadly, this\
      \ guy attributes the gametype to some XBox game called Fuzion Frenzy. XBox game?\
      \ Are you serious?</p>\n<p>Look, if you're going to go rip off someone else's\
      \ gameplay - at least have the decency to know their name. This really annoys\
      \ me because the role mods have played in enhanced and innovating first person\
      \ shooters have become more and more obscured over the years. Now, they can't\

      \ Plus it looks nice alongside some other rants:</p>\n<p><b>Focus on the offline\
      \ experience</b> One of Red Orchestra's most noted flaws was an utter lack of\
      \ bot support (somthing they are just recently addressing). With a strong AI\
      \ presence, people might be able to at least get the taste of an offline game\
      \ to whet their appetite to find a server.</p>\n<p>Or, of course, just design\
      \ a single player game completely and forego the multiplayer. Personally, I\
      \ think coop is the new black. Design a game as a single player with a coop\
      \ component (which is actually what I'm doing now) ... get a bit of both worlds\
      \ and see what happens.</p>\n<p><b>Focus on smaller groups</b> Battlefield 1942\
      \ has apexed, I think, the \"big server\" concept of shooters. There's definately\
      \ a draw to having more than thirty people playing in the same small space.\
      \ It's also much harder to get a decent game going. On the other hand - if you\
      \ focused on say, only six people being online ... maybe a 3v3 match, especially\
      \ with decent bot support ... that's a lot smaller critical mass required.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Learn from Microsoft</b> Ewww, that stung to write. But let's face it\
      \ - Halo 2's matchmaking concepts are still the talk of the town, the belle\
      \ of the ball, the ... OK - I'm out of phrases. At any rate, if you can't rely\
      \ on people to find each other to play your game ... find some way to bring\
      \ them together. And here's a tip - a simple chat lobby isn't going to cut it.\
      \ It never really did.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comment_Box\"\

      <p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> Gamers always suck, it's never good enough no matter\
      \ what you do. Specially with sequels, they want exactly the same as the original,\
      \ but with better graphics, better this, better that, diffirent this and diffirent\
      \ that. Result: a sequel that is not completely the same and the original.</p>\n\
      <p>It would be nice to see mod projects follow the same development plan as\
      \ most open source projects. But ofcourse you would need a nice infrastructure\
      \ for that. Any people in here that have a lot of spare money and want to host\
      \ a source forge like system specially for Unreal engine based mods&#160;?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Dante:</b> What's wrong with getting hosted by sourceforge itself&#160;?</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte TDS:</b> nothing, but the question is, will they host game mods,\
      \ also it would be nice to have a compile farm for weekly? builds.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b>\
      \ SourceForge would be nice. My big beef though is the \"sit and wait\" philosophy.\
      \ Mods should be evolutionary things, but that's almost impossible with \"customers\"\
      \ waiting for the big \"release\". So instead of stepped, but very playable,\
      \ releases, we get rushed releases with any features as they can pack into an\
      \ email. Everyone wants to be CS2 out of the gate, completely skipping the discussion\
      \ side of things that used to be commonplace.</p>\n<p>My only other suggestion\
      \ is that maybe developers start trying to make a habit of testing each other's\
      \ work and giving feedback. But everyone is taking such a blackbox approach\
      \ (can you get more blackbox than a NDA?), it's not forthcoming.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ Rant 1 is great! Please could you consider working with Mychaeel &amp; combine\
      \ both your rants on mod releases into a \"main\" page.</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b>\
      \ Mych and I have very similar rants, but since I don't really know what #3\
      \ will entail - not sure about combining them. If we did though, we should probably\
      \ title it \"dont get us started\". I'll a specific link though.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ Mych has made similar points about use of the terms \"alpha\" and \"beta\"\
      \ and things people should look out for when releasing a mod. How about making\
      \ a page called <a href=\"/Legacy:Releasing_A_Mod\" title=\"Legacy:Releasing\
      \ A Mod\">Releasing a Mod</a> to put all this on?</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b> We\
      \ have a section <i>Thoughts on mod making</i> on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Mods\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Making Mods\">Making Mods</a> page, that already has a link\
      \ to Mych's thoughts. Maybe add it there?</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> <b>about\
      \ rant #6</b>: 2D requires much more effort of the 2D artist, every little thing\
      \ has to be drawn by hand (afaik there's no such thing as 2D models), I do agree\
      \ that complete 2D games requires less people. But anyway, it's very well possible\
      \ to create a 2D-ish game using 3D. For example Duke Nukem: Manhatten Project\
      \ is a 2D game, altough there are a couple of 3D elements but most game is in\
      \ 2D. The problem is that when people start on something in 3D they always want\
      \ to use as many dimensions as possible. Here's a nice example: GTA2 or Death\
      \ Rally, both are 2D games but use 3D to add depth to the top-down view. Alien\
      \ Swarm is in fact a 2D game, but uses a 3D engine. I think it's very well possible\
      \ to create a complete 2D game in the UnrealEnigne, with one exception, map\
      \ creation isn't as easy as for most 2D games (e.g. not tile based).</p>\n<p>Here's\
      \ a thougt, so far I've seen top-down and side-scroller games in 3D engines.\
      \ But are there also isometric games that use a real 3D engine?</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b>\
      \ Yeah, you can use 3D engines for a 2D effect - which involves it's own level\
      \ of artistic/production freedom as mods like Alien Swarm can prove. Still about\
      \ the same amound of production costs, though. I agree - the 3 man tiger team\
      \ is probably a bit niave for a totally 2D game - it's asking a lot from the\
      \ 2D artists. Like saying that the Simpsons could be done with one person, instead\
      \ of a team of artists, animators, colorists, etc.</p>\n<p>However, I think\
      \ mods are disappearing - in the traditional sense. UT2003 has already introduced\
      \ more \"professional\" mod teams which are capable of keeping up with the new\
      \ demands of asset production. I was just reading an Unreal Engine 3 preview\
      \ and just wondered - how the hell would a small team be able to keep up with\
      \ these demands? The fact that total conversions are becoming not just the norm,\
      \ but the expectation, combined with the increased demands are pushing the original\
      \ idea of a couple of guys tweaking a game out.</p>\n<p>I don't know if there\
      \ is another solution than to examine these game engines in more consumable\
      \ chunks. Epic might want everyone to be working on the next CS - but some of\
      \ us might have to look at the next Out of this World or Capcom V Marvel.</p>\n\
      <p>And yeah - there are isometric games that use 3D assets. Several, though\
      \ I can only think of an Dreamcast RPG (name escapes me), the upcoming Silent\
      \ Storm sequel, and a version of Ultima Online IIRC.</p>\n<p>I wonder what,\
      \ instead of cel-shaded 3D models, an FPS with really stylized and well done\
      \ 2D assets might look like these days...</p>\n<hr />\n<p><i>Linkage:</i></p>\n\

    text: "==RegX Rants==\n\n===Rant 1: When a release is a release...===\n\nYeah,\
      \ this is a common rant - I'm ranting on it again.  Not just strictly on beta\
      \ vs alpha vs production, but what people actually put out when they say \"\
      this mod is released!\" - because frequently, it's really not.  And at this\
      \ point I don't really care if it's got \"alpha\" or \"beta\" or \"gamma\" next\
      \ to it - unless you specifically state that you are only sending your work\
      \ out for playtesting purposes - I'm considering it playworthy code.  The mod\
      \ community has pretty much killed all such terms as anything informational.\n\
      \nIn no particular order, here are my big pet peeves when I finally try to play\
      \ someone's release:\n\n# '''No umod version.'''  I like umods.  Not everyone\
      \ likes them.  A lot of people do.  I don't really want to care about trying\
      \ to decipher your zipped folder structure.  I like pressing three buttons and\
      \ being done with it.\n# '''Evil umod version.'''  I don't want any of your\
      \ mod's installation to be present when I play normal UT other than selecting\
      \ gametypes and options like I normally would.\n# '''No zipped version.''' \
      \ Yeah.  You should do both.  What?  It's a pain?  Tough.\n# '''Evil zipped\
      \ version.'''  Once I extract the zip, I should be done.  Yes, it's a bit more\
      \ work to setup a folder structure that will easily extract to say, the UT2003\
      \ directory.  Guess what?  Tough.  It's a bit more work for you upfront rather\
      \ than more work everytime someone downloads your files.\n# '''Unrelated files.'''\
      \  If it doesn't have anything to do with your work, installing your work and\
      \ playing your work, then it doesn't belong in the archive.  You might think\
      \ that UberTool2003 works great with your mod and want everyone to have it.\
      \  Fab.  Except for this thing called version control.  Unless you plan on updating\
      \ all the possible archives that hold your version, UberTool2003's version will\
      \ be static.  That means if I had a new UberTool2003 on my drive when I installed\
      \ your mod, I just unwittingly reverted or broke my version.  Thanks.  Don't\
      \ do that.\n# '''Lack of related files.'''  I can't count the number of times\
      \ I've downloaded something, installed it, and have absolutely no clue as to\
      \ what's going on.  Maybe something needs to be bound, or maybe I need to update\
      \ an ini - but I won't know if you won't tell me.  Make sure all the information\
      \ someone needs to play your work is included when they download it.  If I don't\
      \ RTFM, that's my fault.  If you don't ITFM, that's yours.\n# '''Known bug.'''\
      \  This is a pretty minor pet peeve, and I'm pretty certain I've been guilty\
      \ of it - but known bugs should be included in the above, particularly if they\
      \ are serious (like ... bots don't work at all...)\n# '''Whoops! Here's the\
      \ new version!!''' Whoops! You should have playtested it!  Yes I know this is\
      \ in part because the number of people really willing to help test things can\
      \ be generally counted on one paw.  I know some things are just unforseen. \
      \ Stuff happens.  Here's what else - if I just downloaded 50MB of data only\
      \ to see that it's been replaced two days later by another 50MB of \"fixed\"\
      \ data - I'm not only unlikely to download the new version, I'm unlikely to\
      \ ever trust downloading that data again. And finally, to be completely recursive...\n\
      \n# '''It's just a beta.'''  As stated.  If you wanted me to test your work,\
      \ you should have asked.  \n\nHalf of these could be fixed just by using [[Legacy:Umod\
      \ Wizard|Umod Wizard]], the other half are just courtesy.\n\n===Rant 2: It's\
      \ modification not MOD...===\n\nI think it's seriously time for mods to get\
      \ back to their roots - and by that I mean the root of the word \"mod\".  Lately\
      \ I've seen more up and coming modsters and even a few trade rags start referring\
      \ mods as \"MODS\" as if they've suddenly become too large for lowercasing.\n\
      \nLook, mods are \"modifications\" that's where the word comes from - it's where\
      \ it's always come from.  Lately people, and the Unreal community especially,\
      \ have grown to think that mods aren't really a hobby or a past-time, aren't\
      \ really fun additions that they get for free and should take with a grain of\
      \ salt, and aren't really modifications.  Many people seem to expect that all\
      \ mods are going to be Counter-Strike or Tactical Ops.\n\nLet's get this straight.\
      \  Counter-Strike took '''years''' of development.  It's current form has been\
      \ modified by '''teams of professionals'''.  In it's initial form, it was messy.\
      \  it was hacky.  It had exactly one model for all the players and two skins.\
      \  It had maybe a fifth of the weapons it does today.  Defusion hadn't even\
      \ been thought of yet and half the time the scientist seem to hate you for rescuing\
      \ them.  \n\nPeople liked it because it was sufficiently different from what\
      \ they had been playing.  The community started poking at it, playing it, forming\
      \ opinons about it, offering suggestions, etc.  CS's desire to \"stay in beta\"\
      \ was a reflection of this ongoing discussion about the game itself.\n\nHowever,\
      \ if a mod in CS's initial state were released this weekend, I'm guessing most\
      \ current players would download it, play it for a few hours, find some things\
      \ they don't like about it, complain, and stop playing it within a week.  I'm\
      \ guessing this because it seems to have happened several times after Phase\
      \ 1 of the MSUC.\n\nNow we have people offering promotion services for mod teams,\
      \ mod teams contacting lawyers - and NOT because they got a cease and desist\
      \ letter, mods worrying about trade secrets, etc. etc.  There's virtually no\
      \ beta testing or playtesting undercurrent among Unreal players - they pretty\
      \ much expect a beta to be a complete version (partially because many mod teams\
      \ \"release\" their beta versions).  Where does all of this seem to be leading\
      \ us?  Mod teams trying to be more like professional dev teams isn't precisely\
      \ a bad thing - except...\n\nMods were once part of the cutting edge of game\
      \ development.  CTF, Bombing Run, Inventory control, money based systems, class\
      \ based systems - all of these have footholds in mod developments.  With mod\
      \ teams worrying about how \"commercially\" viable their \"product\" is to a\
      \ player base that is starting to expect \"professional\" content - it seems\
      \ to be dying away.   And it's turning into a lose-lose situation.  Mod teams\
      \ will have to expend more time and money to make better content while players\
      \ are going to less content and less innovation.\n\nSo what can be done about\
      \ it?  We have to get back to the grass roots of it all - a shared community\
      \ when it comes to developing, testing, playing, forming opinions.  Public interest\
      \ in mods has to go beyond just expecting CS2.  Mod interest has to go beyond\
      \ trying to make CS2.\n\n===Rant 3: Seriously.  Stop with the MOD crap.===\n\
      \nPeople keep asking me why spelling mod in all caps bothers me so.  Here's\
      \ why:\n\n# It's not an acronym for anything, unles you are building a new Ministry\
      \ of Defense.  If so, good luck but stop yapping and get to work.\n# It's ANNOYING\
      \ to read WORDS that are CAPITALIZED for no good REASON.  \n# And no, you don't\
      \ put in caps because it's short for modification.  Unless you cap FRANK when\
      \ you call him on the PHONE, eh?\n# It's not, despite what you make think, l33t.\
      \  Even if it was, l33t got annoying about 2 years ago.\n# It makes the person\
      \ typing it look juvenile and instantly makes me uncaring about anything they\
      \ have to say after. I prefer to not care about something for better reasons,\
      \ but I've decided that this one will do as well. \n# Finally, it makes mods\
      \ in general look juvenile and silly.  I have a hard enough time convincing\
      \ people that this hobby isn't just for 15 year olds without this nonsense.\
      \  If you can't bring attention to your project without using caps lock, then\
      \ just don't bother the rest of us with it.  The only game in the history of\
      \ gaming to get a reprieve from this is DOOM, so if you don't work for id -\
      \ just let it go.\n\n===Rant 4: One long night of surgery===\n\nSit down, kiddies,\
      \ lemme tell ya a story.\n\nNew hardware arrived yesterday. My plan, as some\
      \ of you know, was to have the basics of a new box built for me - mboard, vid\
      \ card, hard drive and OS. Then I was going to slowly put the pieces of my old\
      \ computer back in.\n\nStep 1 - get the new computer onto the internet, this\
      \ way I could access tech help and drivers as I needed it. Step 1 worked fine.\
      \ Put in some stuff for net connections, bam - there was google.com.\n\nStep\
      \ 2 - put the old HD in. This was the big one, it had all my old work/code on\
      \ it. I had to swap it to be the secondary and had an awful scare when I found\
      \ an empty UT2003 folder, but then I realized where there right partition was\
      \ and bam, data saved.\n\nStep 3 - install old CDRom drive, so that I could\
      \ get software on the beast. No problem. Bing bam, CDROM.\n\nStep 4 - install\
      \ Radeon 9700. This would complete the box and turn it into one hell of a rig.\
      \ No problems. The card I had them put in was also an ATI, so the drivers just\
      \ woke up to the new card.\n\nSeemingly victorious, I danced around for a bit\
      \ and then proceeded to download various programs like Mozilla and Winamp, etc.\n\
      \nThen disaster.\n\nWindows froze.\n\nHard Drive failed. Disk Read Error.\n\n\
      Computer gone. For well over an hour I swapped drives, fumbled cables, tried\
      \ one tiny change or another - but I seemed trapped between the new HD having\
      \ a disk read error, my old hard drive being lost in the new board and throwing\
      \ a blue screen, and the CDROM refusing to be boot.\n\nFeeling defeated, I emailed\
      \ the guys who put it together and almost went to bed (about 1AM now). Just\
      \ for kicks, I poked around a bit on google to see what others had done.\n\n\
      Took me a bit, but I got the BIOS to boot the CDROM first, put my old HD in\
      \ as primary (the new one wasn't even seen by the BIOS now) and put the XP install\
      \ disk. Repair, repair, install, install. Thank GOD Sony decided to partition\
      \ that old computer, because I could do all this knowing my lovely code was\
      \ relatively safe on the second half.\n\nOver an hour later, Windows XP booted\
      \ up. Then I had to teach my old OS (after having to call Microsoft to explain\
      \ to them why I was now re-activating the same XP CD again ... I had forgot\
      \ they added this - it really, really sucks) to see the motherboard's ethernet\
      \ card and the new sound card (an SB Audigy - dang, I'll never go back to onboard\
      \ sound again).\n\nAfter pushing the Far Cry demo around for a bit, I set up\
      \ the UT2004 demo to download and went to bed. Time of now seeming victory:\
      \ 4AM.\n\nIn the morning, the computer had restarted itself.\n\nI tried to redownload\
      \ the demo, it told me the RPC service had died and it was going to restart\
      \ itself anyway.\n\nYup that's right.\n\nAfter all that. I have a virus. A little\
      \ research and my guess is that I've had this virus since about November, but\
      \ my firewall kept it from doing any harm. When the OS repaired, Tiny reset\
      \ it's setup, I accidentally permitted some bizarre request and it awoke.\n\n\
      So after many hours of labor - I have a new computer, an old virus and an 80GB\
      \ paperweight.\n\nThankfully Microsoft has reissued an update, and I can teach\
      \ Tiny how to kill Blaster again while I fix it. Should be OK by this weekend.\
      \ The paperweight's fate is unknown.\n\n===Rant 5: So, what is mod's value?\
      \ ===\n\nRiftwar got a respectable third in the MSUC Phase 2.  Lower than I\
      \ hoped, but I'm glad to be in good company with mods like Seismic and Flag\
      \ Dom, not to mention Rocketeer.  There's a real old school feel to the gametype\
      \ contenders which I'm glad to be nudged into.\n\nWhat I think is curious is\
      \ Steve (o' Epic) Polge's response for feedback on old RW.  Now, I conditionalize\
      \ this by saying I don't totally disagree with Steve and am glad to get ''any''\
      \ feedback from the pro crowd.\n\n''\"Riftwar: Cool ideas, but really deserves\
      \ to become a TC [total conversion]. Too grand a scope for a gametype with no\
      \ custom art to make it feel more different. Scoreboard needs to be improved.\"\
      ''\n\nThis pokes into the heart of why Riftwar ''isn't'' a TC.  And probably\
      \ never will be.  Riftwar was developed while I was working on a TC (the now\
      \ defunct Freehold NG) as a prototype of a specific gametype.  To test some\
      \ of the mechanics of three team gameplay, it was a pretty conscious decision\
      \ not to make rely on the code or design of the TC.  I wanted a clean box to\
      \ play with the concepts and that meant working off of Epic's assets.  The class\
      \ based system was essentially another prototype slapped onto that one in order\
      \ to work around some of the issues of selecting teams and team skins.  As Riftwar\
      \ started to get a life of it's own, the idea to try adding persistence to it\
      \ was more or less another expirement to the pile, but it was also to try and\
      \ elevate the gameplay so that players actually felt like they were in a war,\
      \ not just chasing glowy things.  And so, I can see a bit of Steve's point -\
      \ Riftwar's notion of classes and persistence seem more like a seperate game,\
      \ not just a gametype.\n\nOr do they?  Should they?  At what point should a\
      \ gametype be considered too large for it's shoes?  Onslaught is pretty grand\
      \ for a gametype - large, expansive maps, completely new vehicle code, new weapons,\
      \ new conventions.  If someone made a mutator to add persistent campaigns to\
      \ ONS, would that mean that ONS should instantly also get new player pawns and\
      \ a different HUD?\n\nNow, I'll admit that lack of custom art definately hurts\
      \ Riftwar - reusing models for alternate weapons isn't ideal for the game or\
      \ the player (another point to hopefully be addressed ... or worked around ...\
      \ in the next version), but once again using the ONS analogy - I don't think\
      \ a few new weapon models should instantly mean that it needs to try and be\
      \ a whole new game.  \n\nThe problem is, I think, that this minutia is getting\
      \ lost in the glorification of total conversions as the only real goal for mods.\
      \  This is evident in Epic's scaling of the MSUC prize money.  Large purse money\
      \ makes sense for TC projects - they're large, have lots of people and consume\
      \ enormous resources to get playable versions up and running.   More mysterious\
      \ is why the vehicle category is rewarded over 3 times that of the gametype\
      \ category.  Does a truck add three times more value to playing Unreal than\
      \ say, a completely new way to play Unreal?  It's hard to see that.  Yes, yes,\
      \ many of us are glad that the gametype category got added at all - but then\
      \ it's a head scratcher as to why a (also added later) single phase of Assault\
      \ Maps is worth more than all the phases of gametypes combined.\n\nIf Onslaught\
      \ had been entered as an entry into the Make Something Unreal Contest, the HellBender\
      \ would have been worth more than the game itself.\n\nPerhaps it goes back to\
      \ why gametypes simply got voiceovers in the MSUC Phase 1 video review - they're\
      \ hard to visualize.  Without custom art and assets, there's not much in the\
      \ way of eye candy screenshots to show off.  While the MSUC is an amazing gift\
      \ to the mod and player community - it's also a promotional device.  Gametype\
      \ style mods generally go for gameplay first, look and feel second.  It really\
      \ is an old school tradition - one that is more Threewave CTF than Counter-Strike\
      \ in terms of developing mods.  While nobody can argue the value that the latter\
      \ has given companies like Valve, perhaps it's not a good idea to forget the\
      \ value that the former gave to companies like id and Epic.  Where would Unreal\
      \ Tournament have been without a good game of CTF-Face?\n\nI shrug.  This isn't\
      \ really a complaint or rant, just a reflection.  It seems like there are more\
      \ games out there that aren't pushing the envelope of gameplay - what is Doom\
      \ 3 shipping with for the PC?  Deathmatch?  Team Deathmatch?  Half-Life 2? \
      \ CTF? It's all stuff we've seen before, and it will be left up to the mod communities\
      \ to try and change that.  That, however, won't happen if everyone is busy developing\
      \ a Counter-Strike, not a CTF.\n\nAnd yes.  The scoreboard for Riftwar does,\
      \ indeed, suck.\n\n===Rant 6: An Ode to 2D===\n\nI've been thinking a lot about\
      \ alternate game development lately. The MSUC has had many of my friends push\
      \ me as to why I don't try to do this professionally, but to be honest I don't\
      \ have to go far on the gaming news sites to remember why - cancelled games,\
      \ canned dev teams, innovation gone unnoticed.  I'm OK with all that as long\
      \ I don't rely on it for like, bread and stuff.\n\nI digress.   I'm looking\
      \ to shore up my UT2004 projects once I get DSL running again and/or I'm doing\
      \ moving the heavy stuff around the new apartment.  Riftwar and Grind still\
      \ have a lot of work to do, and I want to rexamine Unreal XL completely (core\
      \ code good, implementation bad).  DFO is in pre-production, which means I'm\
      \ mostly tinkering with old projects.  This usually leaves me looking for something\
      \ new.\n\nI came to realize that FPS modding as a game development base has\
      \ a few detractions.  One - you get really stuck thinking in 3D.  I even had\
      \ someone send me a link to a java game, some simple 2D block thing and I instantly\
      \ thought \"this would be really cool in 3D with 4 people!\"  \n\nThat's just\
      \ wrong.\n\nClearly I had forgotten how elegant a good 2D game can be.  Sure,\
      \ we all like a slick polygonal figure, but look at some of the 2D fighting\
      \ games which survive - some are just slick, fast and fun.  I don't think there's\
      \ any standard in which someone can say that 3D is simply better.  2D can be\
      \ more distinct, faster and colorful than 3D.  \n\nThere's another angle to\
      \ it, though, that I've started to find attractive.  Getting an asset into Unreal\
      \ can take up to 3 people. A concept artist to design it, a 3D artist to model\
      \ it, and a 2D artist to texture it.  And that's naturally not including an\
      \ animator, sound guy and coder.  2D could much more easily be handled just\
      \ by one, or maybe two people.  As the FPS engines get more and more sophisticated,\
      \ this production cost is only going to be increasing (see [[Legacy:The Curse\
      \ Of Static Meshes|The Curse of Static Meshes]] ).\n\nIf there was a really\
      \ sophisticated 2D game engine, on the order of the Unreal or Quake engine,\
      \ an entire game could be done with about 3 people.  Artist, Coder, Musician.\
      \  Compare to the what, 30 people that inhabit mod teams these days?\n\nMaybe\
      \ as people are converting the UE into a side-scrolling or topview engine with\
      \ 3D assets, we should also look at a framework for sprite control which could\
      \ re-introduce 2D into the mainstream.\n\nMaybe.  But for now I have a porch\
      \ covered in boxen.\n\n===Rant 7: A Mod By Any Other Name===\n\nShort one that\
      \ was [http://cathodetan.blogspot.com/2005/01/mod-by-any-other-name.html originally\
      \ on my blog].\n\nSo, I'm reading EGM last night and they have this interview\
      \ with one of the guys responsible for Halo 2. Now I've got nothing against\
      \ Halo 2, liked Halo 1, plan on playing the sequel sometime somehow and I've\
      \ got respect for anyone responsible for that series (not to mention Marathon).\
      \ I've complained in the past about Bungie hyping the hell out of Halo before\
      \ it was really even a game, and then selling it off to Microsoft, but I'm willing\
      \ to let bygones be bygones.\n\nBut this guy, and I'm sorry that I don't have\
      \ the article in front of me, but this guy was talking about a \"lost\" gametype\
      \ - Headhunter. In Headhunter, when you kill someone, you get a skull. You can\
      \ take this skull to a dropoff to get frags. People can kill you and steal your\
      \ skulls.\n\nSound familiar? It should. It was an old Quake mod, relatively\
      \ shortly after the days of Zoid CTF. Sadly, this guy attributes the gametype\
      \ to some XBox game called Fuzion Frenzy. XBox game? Are you serious?\n\nLook,\
      \ if you're going to go rip off someone else's gameplay - at least have the\
      \ decency to know their name. This really annoys me because the role mods have\
      \ played in enhanced and innovating first person shooters have become more and\
      \ more obscured over the years. Now, they can't even get credit when credit\
      \ is due?\n\n===Rant 8: Small solutions to Critical Mass===\n\nThe whole version\
      \ of this rant is on my blog [http://cathodetan.blogspot.com/2005/03/critical-mass.html\
      \ here] ... but I thought I would drop it here for prosperity & discussion.\
      \  Plus it looks nice alongside some other rants:\n\n'''Focus on the offline\
      \ experience''' One of Red Orchestra's most noted flaws was an utter lack of\
      \ bot support (somthing they are just recently addressing). With a strong AI\
      \ presence, people might be able to at least get the taste of an offline game\
      \ to whet their appetite to find a server.\n\nOr, of course, just design a single\
      \ player game completely and forego the multiplayer. Personally, I think coop\
      \ is the new black. Design a game as a single player with a coop component (which\
      \ is actually what I'm doing now) ... get a bit of both worlds and see what\
      \ happens.\n\n'''Focus on smaller groups''' Battlefield 1942 has apexed, I think,\
      \ the \"big server\" concept of shooters. There's definately a draw to having\
      \ more than thirty people playing in the same small space. It's also much harder\
      \ to get a decent game going. On the other hand - if you focused on say, only\
      \ six people being online ... maybe a 3v3 match, especially with decent bot\
      \ support ... that's a lot smaller critical mass required.\n\n'''Learn from\
      \ Microsoft''' Ewww, that stung to write. But let's face it - Halo 2's matchmaking\
      \ concepts are still the talk of the town, the belle of the ball, the ... OK\
      \ - I'm out of phrases. At any rate, if you can't rely on people to find each\
      \ other to play your game ... find some way to bring them together. And here's\
      \ a tip - a simple chat lobby isn't going to cut it. It never really did.\n\n\
      ----\n\n===Comment Box===\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' Gamers always suck, it's never\
      \ good enough no matter what you do. Specially with sequels, they want exactly\
      \ the same as the original, but with better graphics, better this, better that,\
      \ diffirent this and diffirent that. Result: a sequel that is not completely\
      \ the same and the original. \n\nIt would be nice to see mod projects follow\
      \ the same development plan as most open source projects. But ofcourse you would\
      \ need a nice infrastructure for that. Any people in here that have a lot of\
      \ spare money and want to host a source forge like system specially for Unreal\
      \ engine based mods ?\n\n'''Dante:''' What's wrong with getting hosted by sourceforge\
      \ itself ?\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' nothing, but the question is, will they host\
      \ game mods, also it would be nice to have a compile farm for weekly? builds.\n\
      \n'''RegularX:''' SourceForge would be nice.  My big beef though is the \"sit\
      \ and wait\" philosophy.  Mods should be evolutionary things, but that's almost\
      \ impossible with \"customers\" waiting for the big \"release\".  So instead\
      \ of stepped, but very playable, releases, we get rushed releases with any features\
      \ as they can pack into an email.  Everyone wants to be CS2 out of the gate,\
      \ completely skipping the discussion side of things that used to be commonplace.\
      \  \n\nMy only other suggestion is that maybe developers start trying to make\
      \ a habit of testing each other's work and giving feedback.  But everyone is\
      \ taking such a blackbox approach (can you get more blackbox than a NDA?), it's\
      \ not forthcoming.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Rant 1 is great! Please could you consider\
      \ working with Mychaeel & combine both your rants on mod releases into a \"\
      main\" page.\n\n'''RegularX:''' Mych and I have very similar rants, but since\
      \ I don't really know what #3 will entail - not sure about combining them. If\
      \ we did though, we should probably title it \"dont get us started\".  I'll\
      \ a specific link though.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Mych has made similar points about\
      \ use of the terms \"alpha\" and \"beta\" and things people should look out\
      \ for when releasing a mod. How about making a page called [[Legacy:Releasing\
      \ A Mod|Releasing a Mod]] to put all this on?\n\n'''RegularX:''' We have a section\
      \ ''Thoughts on mod making'' on the [[Legacy:Making Mods|Making Mods]] page,\
      \ that already has a link to Mych's thoughts.  Maybe add it there?\n\n'''El\
      \ Muerte:''' '''about rant #6''': 2D requires much more effort of the 2D artist,\
      \ every little thing has to be drawn by hand (afaik there's no such thing as\
      \ 2D models), I do agree that complete 2D games requires less people. But anyway,\
      \ it's very well possible to create a 2D-ish game using 3D. For example Duke\
      \ Nukem: Manhatten Project is a 2D game, altough there are a couple of 3D elements\
      \ but most game is in 2D. The problem is that when people start on something\
      \ in 3D they always want to use as many dimensions as possible. Here's a nice\
      \ example: GTA2 or Death Rally, both are 2D games but use 3D to add depth to\
      \ the top-down view. Alien Swarm is in fact a 2D game, but uses a 3D engine.\
      \ I think it's very well possible to create a complete 2D game in the UnrealEnigne,\
      \ with one exception, map creation isn't as easy as for most 2D games (e.g.\
      \ not tile based).\n\nHere's a thougt, so far I've seen top-down and side-scroller\
      \ games in 3D engines. But are there also isometric games that use a real 3D\
      \ engine?\n\n'''RegularX:''' Yeah, you can use 3D engines for a 2D effect -\
      \ which involves it's own level of artistic/production freedom as mods like\
      \ Alien Swarm can prove.  Still about the same amound of production costs, though.\
      \  I agree - the 3 man tiger team is probably a bit niave for a totally 2D game\
      \ - it's asking a lot from the 2D artists.  Like saying that the Simpsons could\
      \ be done with one person, instead of a team of artists, animators, colorists,\
      \ etc.\n\nHowever, I think mods are disappearing - in the traditional sense.\
      \  UT2003 has already introduced more \"professional\" mod teams which are capable\
      \ of keeping up with the new demands of asset production.  I was just reading\
      \ an Unreal Engine 3 preview and just wondered - how the hell would a small\
      \ team be able to keep up with these demands?  The fact that total conversions\
      \ are becoming not just the norm, but the expectation, combined with the increased\
      \ demands are pushing the original idea of a couple of guys tweaking a game\
      \ out.\n\nI don't know if there is another solution than to examine these game\
      \ engines in more consumable chunks.  Epic might want everyone to be working\
      \ on the next CS - but some of us might have to look at the next Out of this\
      \ World or Capcom V Marvel.\n\nAnd yeah - there are isometric games that use\
      \ 3D assets.  Several, though I can only think of an Dreamcast RPG (name escapes\
      \ me), the upcoming Silent Storm sequel, and a version of Ultima Online IIRC.\n\
      \nI wonder what, instead of cel-shaded 3D models, an FPS with really stylized\
      \ and well done 2D assets might look like these days...\n\n----\n\n''Linkage:''\n\
