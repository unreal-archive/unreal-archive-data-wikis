      \ will never be finished and even more so those that are doomed from the outset.\
      \ Thus I thought (with a fair amount of experience of unfinished projects myself)\
      \ that it was finally time to sort things out. This document probably dosen't\
      \ come close to solving the problems, but if one more project (even/especially\
      \ if i'm involved) gets finished as a result of it I'll be <b>very</b> happy.</p>\n\
      <p>I'll refer to <i><b>things</b></i> a lot in the below bullet points, thus\
      \ it might be an idea to explain what i mean. Basically a <i><b>thing</b></i>\
      \ means any map, program, feature, mutator or whatever, generally a <i><b>thing</b></i>\
      \ takes some time to do, a fair amount of effort, and a good amount of dedication\
      \ to complete 'properly'.</p>\n<p>Points on finishing <i><b>things</b></i></p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Have an idea of what your <i><b>thing</b></i> should be. However this\
      \ is not enough, you must also have a good idea how to make it as well, or it's\
      \ highly unlikely you'll ever finish it.</li>\n<li>Never attempt a <i><b>thing</b></i>\
      \ you do not currently have the knowledge or materials to see right through\
      \ to the end. If for somereason you <b>must</b> attempt something and dont have\
      \ the correct knowledge or materials the <b>get them first!</b>. In many way's\
      \ this seems obvious, but so many people ignore it that it's worth stating anyway.\
      \ Theirs nothing more laughable then some idiot with no skill, whose <i>going\
      \ to make a really good game</i> when its obvious they couldn't make text appear.</li>\n\
      <li>Try to model 'Observentally' instead of 'Properly' (yes they are my own\
      \ terms before you ask). This is the difference between attempting to model\
      \ something perfectly, taking everything into account, compared to bodging something\
      \ that just <i>looks right</i>. It's easier, faster and surprisingly often gives\
      \ better results. There are many <i><b>things</b></i> that this doesn't apply\
      \ to, however it's still worth a mention.</li>\n<li>Teamwork kills more small\
      \ projects than it helps (at least in my experience). If you can create your\
      \ <i><b>thing</b></i> by yourself then do so and ignore offers of help. They\
      \ will change your ideas, meddle with things, argue, annoy and generally worsen\
      \ the final result. This might seem harsh or unfair and even bad advice. However\
      \ I have yet to complete a <i><b>thing</b></i> with someone else, and believe\
      \ me, I've tried. Get 'help' on small things but avoid 'partnerships' they reek\
      \ of faliure.</li>\n<li>Try, Try, Try Again... Give up, come back later, approach\
      \ it from a different angle, try again then quit. Theres no point getting disheartened.</li>\n\
      <li>Finally and most importantly, always remember <b>A FINISHED BUT POOR</b>\
      \ <i><b>THING</b></i> <b>IS TWICE AS GOOD AS A INCOMPLETE GREAT ONE</b>. And\
      \ you can quote me on that,&#160;:)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rant over...</p>\n<p><a\
