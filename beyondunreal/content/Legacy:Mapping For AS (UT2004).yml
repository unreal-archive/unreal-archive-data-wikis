      <p>Assault is a team based gametype where one team is attacking the other -\
      \ a progression of objectives must be completed to finish the round. Objectives\
      \ usually consist of driving a vehicle to a check point, holding a lever to\
      \ progress to the next area or destroying objects to get past.</p>\n<p>The style\
      \ of assault maps can vary greatly between maps and you can do pretty close\
      \ to anything you want in terms of size and layout.</p>\n<p>The default assault\
      \ maps that come with the game are fairly linear and players have to follow\
      \ a set route with usually one or two alternatives but then centralising around\
      \ the objective.</p>\n<p>If you are looking to make an Assualt Map with no experience\
      \ about assault you will want to read through the <a href=\"/Legacy:Assault_Mapping_Tutorial\"\

      <p><b>(Properties -&gt; Display -&gt; CullDistance)</b>: If you have an indoor\
      \ Assault Map, there is a good chance you won't be using fog, but there is also\
      \ a good chance that most of the Static Meshes in the level won't be seen at\
      \ the same time. By setting the static meshes a CullDistance, they won't be\
      \ rendered by the engine when they are further away from you than this distance,\
      \ even if they aren't occluded by fog, AntiPotals or Zones.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Checkpoints\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Another thing that you can do is have 'checkpoint'\
      \ areas close off as previous parts of your map become empty (as the mission\
      \ progresses). This allows you to trigger antiportals to hide these unused inaccessable\
      \ areas, making rendering much less taxing.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"Doors\">Doors</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_AS_(UT2004)?section=6\" title=\"\
      Edit section: Doors\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Make an antiportal that is the same size of your door but a bit wider (a\
      \ few pixels, so it covers any zoneportals you may be using in the doorway when\
      \ it is closed). Put it over the door. In the properties of the door, go to\
      \ the Mover group. In AntiPortalTag set it a unique name. Then in the properties\
      \ of the AntiPortal, go to the Events group and set its Tag the same as what\
      \ you just entered in the mover's AntiPortalTag. Go to the Movement group and\
      \ set the AntiPortal's AttachTag to that of the tag of the door. Then go to\
      \ the Object group (still in the AntiPortal's properties) and set InitialState\
      \ to TriggerToggle. This will stop whatever is behind the door (line of sight,\
      \ unless the door is a zone portal as well) being rendered when the door is\
      \ closed (when the AntiPortal is active and down) but when the door opens the\
      \ AntiPortal gets turned off and moved out with the door, so it is as if it\
      \ was never there. When the door shuts again it turns back on. This is very\
      \ useful if you have a lot of indoor-outdoor areas.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Hiding Areas\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>When you place an AntiPortal it is turned on by default.\
      \ Triggering it will disable it (provided it's Object -&gt; InitialState property\
      \ is set to TriggerToggle). You can use a sheet AP to stop rendering of all\
      \ the behind bits of a map until players can actually get in there, at which\
      \ point you turn it off.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"AntiPortal_size\"\

      \ they won't be rendered by the engine when they are further away from you than\
      \ this distance, even if they aren't occluded by fog, AntiPotals or Zones.\n\
      \n===Checkpoints===\n\nAnother thing that you can do is have 'checkpoint' areas\
      \ close off as previous parts of your map become empty (as the mission progresses).\
      \ This allows you to trigger antiportals to hide these unused inaccessable areas,\
      \ making rendering much less taxing.\n\n===Doors===\n\nMake an antiportal that\
      \ is the same size of your door but a bit wider (a few pixels, so it covers\
      \ any zoneportals you may be using in the doorway when it is closed). Put it\
      \ over the door. In the properties of the door, go to the Mover group. In AntiPortalTag\
      \ set it a unique name. Then in the properties of the AntiPortal, go to the\
      \ Events group and set its Tag the same as what you just entered in the mover's\
      \ AntiPortalTag. Go to the Movement group and set the AntiPortal's AttachTag\
      \ to that of the tag of the door. Then go to the Object group (still in the\
      \ AntiPortal's properties) and set InitialState to TriggerToggle. This will\
      \ stop whatever is behind the door (line of sight, unless the door is a zone\
      \ portal as well) being rendered when the door is closed (when the AntiPortal\
      \ is active and down) but when the door opens the AntiPortal gets turned off\
      \ and moved out with the door, so it is as if it was never there. When the door\
      \ shuts again it turns back on. This is very useful if you have a lot of indoor-outdoor\
      \ areas.\n\n===Hiding Areas===\n\nWhen you place an AntiPortal it is turned\
      \ on by default. Triggering it will disable it (provided it's Object -> InitialState\
      \ property is set to TriggerToggle). You can use a sheet AP to stop rendering\
      \ of all the behind bits of a map until players can actually get in there, at\
      \ which point you turn it off.\n\n===AntiPortal size===\n\nRemember, one big\
      \ [[Legacy:Antiportal|antiportal]] is always better than lots of little ones.\
      \ Always.\n\n===Zoning===\n\nTry to place [[Legacy:ZonePortal|ZonePortal]]s\
      \ in a place where they won't be seen that often. This causes the other zones\
      \ to be rendered less often.\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://www.angelmapper.com/gamedev/tutorials/assault.htm\

      \ I will update this later, as well as writing a decent Assault mapping tutorial\
      \ that gets into the nitty-gritty, evil, nasty bits of it at some point. Feel\
      \ free to add things to it (hey, this is the Wiki after all!) - ''MarZer''\n\
      \n}}\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I've tidied up a bit. Some bits are general and could\
      \ be moved to other pages (eg cull distance)\n\n'''Catdæmon:''' Hope this is\
      \ the right way to comment... oh well. Nice tutorial!\n\n'''MarZer:''' Cheers\
      \ Cat! I'm not done yet though. Over the next week or so I will be working with\
      \ PointlesS to write a fully-fledged Assault Mapping Tutorial - one that *attempts*\
      \ to cover all the bases.\n\n'''Boksha:''' \"Make an antiportal that is the\
      \ same size of your door but a bit narrower.\" Wouldn't it make more sense to\
      \ make the antiportal WIDER than the door? That way you could also have it block\
      \ a zoneportal that's also in the door, and make sure nothing on the other side\
      \ of the door gets rendered if it doesn't have to be.\n\n'''MarZer:''' Indeed,\
      \ thanks :) . *edits page*\n\n'''Blip2:''' Moved pathing stuff to [[Legacy:Pathing\
      \ For Assault|Pathing for Assault]] - I'll add more general stuff about assault\
      \ later and finish tidying up\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
