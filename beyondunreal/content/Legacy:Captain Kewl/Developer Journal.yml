      <p>Last monday I made my way to the local EB and forced them to happily sell\
      \ me a copy of UT2k3 before they were ready to put it up on display. In the\
      \ days since, I have spent unhealthy amounts of time studying the new codebase,\
      \ and can thus far only conclude this:</p>\n<p>I am shocked and APPALLED that\
      \ they have removed the \"Fatness\" actor display property.</p>\n<p>In spite\
      \ of this tragedy, I feel it is my duty to not only myself but to the greater\
      \ UT community that I continue in my efforts to contribute. Thus we take our\
      \ first steps toward the As-yet-unnamed \"XCTF\"-based mod.</p>\n<p>My working\
      \ idea for constructing this mod is to use a series of mutators, each responsible\
      \ for specific rules. The reason why I chose this is because 1.) A basic CTF\
      \ gametype already exists in 2k3, and 2.) the additional rules (full weapons),\
      \ are general enough that they can be effectively applied to virtually any other\
      \ gametype as well. Avoid redundancy and insure consistency.</p>\n<p>The only\
      \ real sticking point here is the Grapple. The difficult part isn't the implementation\
      \ of the grapple itself, but effective application to the Bot AI. Would we be\
      \ able to get away with using mutators for this? In UT I implemented bot grappling\
      \ by co-opting the actions induced by the translocator – none of the AI changes\
      \ were made to the Bots themselves. I haven't looked through the 2k3 code in\
      \ depth yet, but in UT translocation was handled specifically by the navgationpoints\
      \ and the X-loc itself: the navigationpoint forced the bot to switch to the\
      \ X-loc and then fire. Keeping it short, my implementation of the grapple involved\
      \ simply replacing the X-loc and tweaking where the bot aimed.</p>\n<p>So yes,\
      \ it's possible to get a bot to use a grapple to get to unreachable places without\
      \ gutting the bot AI. But something that sticks out in my mind about 2k3 is\
      \ the way bots USE the X-loc. As a means of normal travel, even if it's just\
      \ to the other side of a room. If we're going to have a grapple, it's only right\
      \ that we have the bots use it in the same *intelligent* manner it uses the\
      \ X-loc... which raises the issue of whether or not the same hack can be used.\
      \ When using the X-loc to travel, are bots still using navpoints? Or are they\
      \ just using fuzzy logic to guess how best to get to their destination?</p>\n\
      <p>If it's the latter, then we might have to go the route of tweaking the bot\
      \ controller AI. Which is where we have to decide about mutator use. Would a\
      \ mutator be the best way to swap controllers? (Is it even possible with a mutator?)</p>\n\
      <p>Mutator construction itself is still pretty straightforward. Game Rules –\
      \ player stats, scoring, and damage modification – have now been split off from\
      \ GameInfo. Thus for a mutator to hook into any of the GameRules functions,\
      \ you now need to accompany the mutator with GameRules subclass. It's otherwise\
      \ pretty much unchanged.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"07_Oct_2002\"\

      <p>The DE particle emission class == cool. It’s about damn time UT had some\
      \ proper support for beam effects.</p>\n<p>So the grapple is in and more or\
      \ less functional. Interesting exercise in aquinting myself with the new structure\
      \ for weapons; there’s now something like 5 different classes to deal with.\
      \ The weapon as an inventory class is still intact, but really now just exists\
      \ to serve the same purpose as ammo – to show that the weapon exists in the\
      \ player’s inventory. Facets of the weapon have been abstracted into wholely\
      \ separate classes, including ones which represent the weapon as viewed as either\
      \ a pickup or 3pp, and ones which control the actual weapon behavior. Which\
      \ actually makes a whole lot of sense, particularly the different pickup and\
      \ 3pp classes, but makes things a bit more difficult to keep track of.</p>\n\
      <p>The grapple is more or less based on various previous UT implementations,\
      \ mostly my own. The weapon fires a projectile which, when it lands, adds a\
      \ velocity to the player which draws him near. One nice thing about the WeaponFire\
      \ class is that the abstraction supports firing modes that are contingent upon\
      \ the player holding the fire button down; no need for any kind of tick-bound\
      \ “if ( bFire&#160;!= 0 )” checks. Thus the grapple can have two modes: the\
      \ first is a Quake-style automatic recall on buttonup, the alternate fire is\
      \ a normal fire/recall. The rope is implemented using an xEmitter subclass,\
      \ largely based on the Ion Painter beam.</p>\n<p>I subclassed the xPlayer controller\
      \ class in order to put in an exec function which grabs the grapple in inventory\
      \ and co-opts its WeaponFire. I’m using the alt mode, so calling the “hook”\
      \ function once will fire the hook, and calling it again, or “unhook”, will\
      \ recall it. There’s our offhand grapple. I’m considering removing this and\
      \ placing it in an inventory item instead – it would make an offhand/no offhand\
      \ gametype configuration easier to implement, I think.</p>\n<p>The keybinding\
      \ for the grapple goes to an alias… don’t have my user.ini open right now, but\
      \ it’s something like “hook | onbuttonup unhook” I’m a bit trepid about going\
      \ this route – somehow it evokes that shock combo binding used by people who\
      \ aren’t coordinated enough to move two fingers. For a while I was considering\
      \ implementing another input byte… but then, that would also require using a\
      \ similar alias, and on top of that, could get pretty nasty code-wise with the\
      \ grapple needing some controller-specific code; it counters the abstraction\
      \ I’d like to maintain. Choose the lesser of two evils, I guess.</p>\n<p>Net\
      \ code is probably a bigger priority than bot support. Arbitrarily calling AddVelocity\
      \ for the purpose of pawn locomotion isn’t the most client-friendly thing to\
      \ do. Player movement prediction is pretty much how I had it figured while toying\
      \ with the idea of changing player physics on M:R – all taken care of in the\
      \ controller’s PlayerMove() function which makes one call to the client and\
      \ one call to the server – though it’s nice that they now have comments which\
      \ confirm this. I’m thinking more and more that I’m going to have to go with\
      \ a new movement state. (Hey, if we’re going to mess around with the controller,\
      \ might as well go all the way.)</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      http://www.boilingpoint.com/~jasonyu/ut/\">I got distracted</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyway.\
      \ I ended up going with a new movement state for the playerpawn.</p>\n<p>Each\
      \ time the user manually presses a key to move in any direction, an acceleration\
      \ is applied to the pawn. This acceleration is what causes the player to move\
      \ – the player’s velocity is what results. Client prediction doesn’t care about\
      \ the velocity – the player’s position over time – but instead uses the acceleration\
      \ – the player’s velocity over time. That way it can not only determine the\
      \ client’s position, but also where it will likely be in the next update.</p>\n\
      <p>Arbitrarily using AddVelocity doesn’t work, since velocity is neither replicated\
      \ nor predicted. The new version of the grapple instead tells the player to\
      \ accelerate in a given vector and sends the player to the new state, “Hooked”\
      . There the controller uses state-specific versions of PlayerMove and ProcessMove\
      \ to handle the changes. The Hooked state itself is extended from the PlayerFlying\
      \ state, as we basically want the same thing – to have the player fly – only\
      \ in this case the player’s acceleration will only be affected by the grapple\
      \ and no player input.</p>\n<p>The magnitude of acceleration for grappling players\
      \ is 2048, the same amount used for all pawn movenent with the exception of\
      \ jumping, which I believe is something like 6000. The latter is more than sufficient,\
      \ though, as with such a player can easily do instant 180-degree turns and start\
      \ running in the opposite direction without missing a beat. The grapple tells\
      \ the player to cap the maximum air speed at 700, so a grappling player will\
      \ never move at more than twice as fast as his running speed. This value will\
      \ most likely undergo further tweaking.</p>\n<p>Oh, and bots can grapple-walk.\
      \ Basically done by hacking up the xloc-hop code and refitting it for use with\
      \ the grapple. Bots use manual fire on the immediate next node they want to\
      \ travel to, and when they are pulled close enough, the grapple unhooks. The\
      \ grapple will automatically unhook and drop the bot after two seconds anyway,\
      \ just to insure that the bot doesn’t somehow get stuck. Still needs some tweaking\
      \ – need to write up some better logic for the bots’s grapple aiming. Keep it\
      \ from shooting the hook off into space while aiming at an uphill target. Things\
      \ like that. Need to work on getting the bots to grapple on to actual targets,\
      \ ie high platforms, next.</p>\n<p>Seeing the bots use the grapple to get around\
      \ is extremely, extremely gratifying.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \n====13 Oct 2002====\n\nUm…  [http://www.boilingpoint.com/~jasonyu/ut/ I got\
      \ distracted].\n\nAnyway.  I ended up going with a new movement state for the\
      \ playerpawn.  \n\nEach time the user manually presses a key to move in any\
      \ direction, an acceleration is applied to the pawn.  This acceleration is what\
      \ causes the player to move – the player’s velocity is what results.  Client\
      \ prediction doesn’t care about the velocity – the player’s position over time\
      \ – but instead uses the acceleration – the player’s velocity over time.  That\
      \ way it can not only determine the client’s position, but also where it will\
      \ likely be in the next update.\n\nArbitrarily using AddVelocity doesn’t work,\
      \ since velocity is neither replicated nor predicted.  The new version of the\
      \ grapple instead tells the player to accelerate in a given vector and sends\
      \ the player to the new state, “Hooked”.  There the controller uses state-specific\
      \ versions of PlayerMove and ProcessMove to handle the changes.  The Hooked\
      \ state itself is extended from the PlayerFlying state, as we basically want\
      \ the same thing – to have the player fly – only in this case the player’s acceleration\
      \ will only be affected by the grapple and no player input.\n\nThe magnitude\
      \ of acceleration for grappling players is 2048, the same amount used for all\
      \ pawn movenent with the exception of jumping, which I believe is something\
      \ like 6000.  The latter is more than sufficient, though, as with such a player\
      \ can easily do instant 180-degree turns and start running in the opposite direction\
      \ without missing a beat.  The grapple tells the player to cap the maximum air\
      \ speed at 700, so a grappling player will never move at more than twice as\
      \ fast as his running speed.  This value will most likely undergo further tweaking.\n\
      \nOh, and bots can grapple-walk.  Basically done by hacking up the xloc-hop\
      \ code and refitting it for use with the grapple.  Bots use manual fire on the\
      \ immediate next node they want to travel to, and when they are pulled close\
      \ enough, the grapple unhooks.  The  grapple will automatically unhook and drop\
      \ the bot after two seconds anyway, just to insure that the bot doesn’t somehow\
      \ get stuck.  Still needs some tweaking – need to write up some better logic\
      \ for the bots’s grapple aiming.  Keep it from shooting the hook off into space\
      \ while aiming at an uphill target.  Things like that.  Need to work on getting\
      \ the bots to grapple on to actual targets, ie high platforms, next.\n\nSeeing\
      \ the bots use the grapple to get around is extremely, extremely gratifying.\n\
      \n====21 Oct 2002====\n\nAnd then I passed everything off to the guys at the\
      \ [http://www.thecgn.com/q2/ Coliseum] to tweak to their hearts' content.\n\n\
      If anyone else is interested in the sources, drop me a note and I'll hook you\
      \ up.  (Ba-dum-bum-crash!)\n\n====20 Nov 2002====\n\nSomething I hacked together,\
      \ based on a [[Legacy:Lens_Flare|discussion]] from sometime back.\n\n[http://www.boilingpoint.com/~jasonyu/ut/lensflare.jpg]\n\
      \n====21 Nov 2002====\n\nSome tweaking of the textures and placement.  Another\
      \ screenshot:\n\n[http://www.boilingpoint.com/~jasonyu/ut/lensflare2.jpg]\n\n\
      What I'd like is to be able to somehow hook into however standard coronas are\
      \ rendered and have the flares mirror that behavior.  I suspect it's somewhere\
      \ in the native code, though, so I may be SOL.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Journal|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
