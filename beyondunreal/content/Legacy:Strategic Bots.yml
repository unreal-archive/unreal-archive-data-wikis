      Legacy:AmbushPoint\">AmbushPoint</a> can be set up by matching the ScriptedPawn\
      \ Tag with the AmbushPoint Tag and setting the ScriptedPawn to <tt>Orders='Ambushing'</tt>.\
      \ The ScriptedPawn will travel to any one of the AmbushPoints set this way and\
      \ wait for a player it sees within the given <tt>AmbushPoint.SightRadius</tt>\
      \ to attack. If <tt>AmbushPoint.bSniping</tt> is set to true, it will stay at\
      \ the point and snipe.</p>\n<p>In UT200x, ambushing &amp; camping can be achieved\
      \ by using an <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealScriptedSequence\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealScriptedSequence\"\
      >UnrealScriptedSequence</a> (set to \"Freelance\") to get the bot to WaitForPlayer,\

      <p>Beyond mere defense, it's possible to make a bot snipe when it sees the enemy.</p>\n\
      <p>If it is a sniping spot, set bSniping to <tt>true</tt> under the AmbushPoint\
      \ tab contained within the preferences of the DefensePoint actor (the DefensePoint\
      \ actor inherits the sniping info from it's parent class, the <a href=\"/Legacy:AmbushPoint\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:AmbushPoint\">AmbushPoint</a> actor). Also, make sure to rotate\
      \ the DefensePoint so it points in the direction you want the bot to snipe.\
      \ It is also a good idea to place <a href=\"/Legacy:DistanceViewTrigger\" title=\"\
      Legacy:DistanceViewTrigger\">DistanceViewTriggers</a> in connection with the\
      \ sniping point to any spot where you want the bot to snipe. Note that failing\
      \ to do this in conjuction with sniping points that are far away from the action\
      \ (ala the sniping lofts in Face), tends to result in bots toting rocket launchers\
      \ and other weaponry besides the sniper rifle up to the sniping point and standing\
      \ out in the open making their head a nice sweet target. (Also note that just\
      \ because the bot doesn't have the sniper rifle out doesn't mean you failed\
      \ in placing the DVT's, they won't switch to the rifle until the first time\
      \ a DVT is triggered).</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Setting_the_view_direction\"\

      \ this would be an ideal way to get bots to hold a strategic position in enemy\
