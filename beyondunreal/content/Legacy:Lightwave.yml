      \ Lightwave and MAX is my experience only. I have used Lightwave for most of\
      \ my young adult life and I have very little experience in MAX. My comparisons\
      \ may sound biased and if anyone sees something that isn't true (IE not my opinion)\
      \ then please, post a comment in the comments section and I will try to fix\
      \ it.</p>\n<p><b>Lightwave</b> is a professional <a href=\"/Legacy:Topics_On_Modeling\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Topics On Modeling\">modeling</a> and animating <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Application\" title=\"Legacy:Application\">application</a> designed\
      \ by <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.newtek.com/\"\
      >Newtek</a></p>\n<p>Lightwave comes with 2 programs, Lightwave Modeler which\
      \ is devoted to modeling, and Lightwave Layout which is devoted to animating.\
      \ Most people might think this is a little inconvenient, but having 2 distinct\
      \ programs for each job, means that the programs are more specialized. You don't\
      \ see animating tools in the modeling program, because the modeling program\
      \ is jammed with tools for modeling. Unlike MAX which displays the tools for\
      \ both jobs in the same window, with lightwave, you can focus on a particular\
      \ aspect without the interference of buttons from other areas.. As far as I\
      \ can tell, Lightwave displays more buttons for functions that MAX does. Then\
      \ again, and someone can correct me if I'm wrong, I don't know much about MAX.&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_lightwave.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\" title=\"4 viewports: Right, Perspective, Front, Top\"><img\
      \ alt=\"4 viewports: Right, Perspective, Front, Top\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_lightwave.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"320\" height=\"231\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>Lightwave has 4 viewports\
      \ that allow you to view your model from 7 different angles. Each viewport can\
      \ be set to anyone of these angles. It <b>is</b> possible to set all viewports\
      \ to the same angle, such as the front view, but why would you want to do that?\
      \ Lightwave comes packaged with a ton of useful modeling, and animating tools,\
      \ however, there are many more tools from 3rd party developers that can be bought\
      \ or downloaded. Newtek also has plugins that can be purchased.</p>\n<p>So,\
      \ MAX is cool too, why should I look at Lightwave? Well, here's a quote from\
      \ Newtek's site:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003 has a huge 3D object library that comes with UnrealEd: Unreal Tournament2003’\
      s level editor. Many of these objects have been made at Digital Extremes using\
      \ LightWave©.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can do anything you want with Lightwave\
      \ that you can do with MAX and in some cases, it's easier. Lightwave supports\
      \ exporting your models to 3DS which is the format that the 3ds2unr utility\
      \ uses. And, UnrealEd also supports the Lightwave object format as well. See\
      \ the external link below to see how to get your Lightwave models into UnrealED.</p>\n\
      <p>The features list for Lightwave is way too big, so I've provided a link directly\
      \ to their features page. On this page you will see that different aspects of\
      \ Lightwave are divided into sections. Lightwave allows for fine control through\
      \ the use of graphs. Using these graphs you can plot information depending on\
      \ which tool you're using. Many tools for animating, and possibly modeling,\
      \ or rendering [I'm not sure about the last 2 though] allow for the use of these\
      \ such graphs. You can also see from this list, that graphs are not the only\
      \ tools that have features listed. <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\"\
