      \ like the ASCII counterpart.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> What sort of markup do\
      \ you envisage? What sort of output?</p>\n<p><b>Sobiwan:</b>Sobiwan: Since markup\
      \ is supposed to affect layout and people are using ASCII to create hierarchal\
      \ layout such as found on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_Class_Hierarchy\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Actor Class Hierarchy\">Actor Class Hierarchy</a> page, it would be good\
      \ to include this type of layout as a markup to keep the concept of markup lauyout\
      \ consistent. One could create a markup such as:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"\
      mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n\
      <pre class=\"de1\"><span class=\"sy0\">&lt;</span>hierarchy<span class=\"sy0\"\

      \ class=\"sy0\">&gt;</span></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>The WIKI would display the\
      \ lines nicely, auto indent sub-items, auto indent word wrapped sub-items. It\
      \ doesnt have to be collapsable, just make good looking layout instead of relying\
      \ on ASCII.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> well what I was thinking you'd want to write\
      \ was this:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\"\
      >\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"de1\"><span class=\"\
      sy0\">+</span> Parent\n<span class=\"sy0\">++</span> Child\n<span class=\"sy0\"\
      >++</span> Child2</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>It could output the sort of ASCII\
      \ we currently do. I don't know how we can \"display the lines nicely\" in HTML.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Sobiwan:</b> The only requirement for markup is ease. &#160;:) Perhaps\
      \ the markup would generate a dynamic table or CSS formatting to get lines,\
      \ colors, indentation and word wrap.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I think the current\
      \ ASCII tree is fine for readers. The problem as I see it is that it is a pain\
      \ for writers to create. It might be possible to create a tree-type thing with\
      \ CSS but it would be a huge mess, unless there's something I've not thought\
      \ of. This is all academic, as it's Mych's Wookee that has to be altered and\
      \ I think it's beyond my perl skills.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Let's look at a\
      \ typical ASCII art hierarchy:</p>\n<pre>Parent\n +- Child 1\n |   +- Child\
      \ of Child 1\n |       +- Grandchild of Child 1\n +- Child 2\n     +- Child\
      \ 1 of Child 2\n     |   +- Grandchild of Child 2\n     +- Child 2 of Child\
      \ 2\n</pre>\n<p>That could be created with Wiki Markup like this:</p>\n<div\
      \ dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript\
      \ source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"de1\"><span class=\"sy0\">+</span>Parent\n\

      \ class=\"nu0\">2</span></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Wookee only has to watch out\
      \ whether a vertical line is neccessary or not.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> That's\
      \ what I envisioned too. But we seem to have lost Mych – I emailed him last\
      \ week to see if he had any ideas about our google problem, and no reply.&#160;:(</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Heh – I replied to your email yesterday. Please check your\
      \ mail before complaining. &#160;:-)</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Hi Mych!&#160;:D&#160;:D\
      \ The system would be quite complex – a certain number of \"+\" need indentation\
      \ with spaces, plus <i>possibly</i> vertical lines, depending on whether there\
      \ are further siblings (that is, a line with the same number of \"+\" before\
      \ the next line with fewer \"+\" or the end of the block. There's also the matter\
      \ of the whole block needing PRE tags, but not the sub blocks. All in all, it\
      \ needs the Wookee-master. But I would say this is lower priority than Jailbreak&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Sobiwan:</b> Yes, there is no rush on this. I wasnt arguing the ASCII\
      \ tree is good or bad for readers or writers, only that I noticed it was not\
      \ following the rule of markup for layout. I like how the markup idea has been\
      \ refined; its easy to follow.</p>\n<p>CSS being customizable, there should\
      \ be a way to define each level of a list to display the vertical and horizontal\
      \ lines. Although I'm rusty at CSS, I can take a stab at getting the layout\
      \ right using simple CSS code, then Mych can figure out how to translate it\
      \ to Wookie.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I'm currently working on this. I have tamed\
      \ wookee (!!!!) and I have the + markup correctly converted into an ASCII tree.\
      \ The last problem is the vertical bars that connect + signs of separated siblings\
      \ – it's proving problematic, but I think I see the solution. (Of course, the\
      \ best way would be a s// that works vertically.... )</p>\n<p><b>OlympusMons:</b>\
      \ Ok so I thought this might be a better place for this stuff as the side bar\

      \ possible to get some sort of sidebar Object class tree going?? Like use the\
      \ functionality I have displayed above for a side bar which can be brought up,\
      \ that way you could browse through the game classes a lot easier. Maybe add\
      \ something to display the custom classes and where they sit on the class tree,\
      \ Im not sure about the unrealated&#160;:o stuff like the mapping stuff but\
      \ for the code side of things I reckon this would be a great feature.</p>\n\
      <p><i>OlympusMons: ok had a quick go but it seems as though the 1.5 line must\
      \ be a standard kinda thing, maybe its just the theme I got on. Hmm well I think\
      \ the whole thing would have to be reformatted to match, I think its fine the\
      \ way it is at the moment. While looking over some of the formatting pages I\
      \ saw that the hierarchy cant go 4 deep and still contain links, dunno if this\
      \ has been fixed etc. Ok now Ive found something I think might be helpful take\
      \ a look at <a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Class_Tree\" title=\"Category:Legacy\
      \ Class Tree\">Category:Legacy Class Tree</a> - see how the pages with subfolders\
      \ get indented, maybe something like this can be adapted for a hierarchy type\
      \ command. Just a suggestion anyway tell me what you think...</i></p>\n\n<!--\

      \ &ndash; I emailed him last week to see if he had any ideas about our google\
      \ problem, and no reply. :(\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Heh &ndash; I replied to your\
      \ email yesterday.  Please check your mail before complaining.  :-)\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Hi Mych! :D :D The system would be quite complex &ndash; a certain number\
      \ of \"+\" need indentation with spaces, plus ''possibly'' vertical lines, depending\
      \ on whether there are further siblings (that is, a line with the same number\
      \ of \"+\" before the next line with fewer \"+\" or the end of the block. There's\
      \ also the matter of the whole block needing PRE tags, but not the sub blocks.\
      \ All in all, it needs the Wookee-master. But I would say this is lower priority\
      \ than Jailbreak :)\n\n'''Sobiwan:''' Yes, there is no rush on this.  I wasnt\
      \ arguing the ASCII tree is good or bad for readers or writers, only that I\
      \ noticed it was not following the rule of markup for layout.  I like how the\
      \ markup idea has been refined; its easy to follow.  \n\nCSS being customizable,\
      \ there should be a way to define each level of a list to display the vertical\
      \ and horizontal lines.  Although I'm rusty at CSS, I can take a stab at getting\
      \ the layout right using simple CSS code, then Mych can figure out how to translate\
      \ it to Wookie.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'm currently working on this. I have tamed\
      \ wookee (!!!!) and I have the + markup correctly converted into an ASCII tree.\
      \ The last problem is the vertical bars that connect + signs of separated siblings\
      \ &ndash; it's proving problematic, but I think I see the solution. (Of course,\
      \ the best way would be a s// that works vertically.... )\n\n'''OlympusMons:'''\
      \ Ok so I thought this might be a better place for this stuff as the side bar\
      \ page is kinda wrong for this piece of info. The stuff below was taken from\
      \ the [[Legacy:Object Class Hierarchy|Object Class Hierarchy]] page and put\
      \ here so that page is much cleaner now.\n\n<div class=\"hidden-block\"><span\

      \ Best I could come up with, with what I know of the tags. :P\n\n'''OlympusMons:'''\
      \ If only that graphic was a single line height and those borders where removed.\
      \ Ok I had an idea, would it be possible to get some sort of sidebar Object\
      \ class tree going?? Like use the functionality I have displayed above for a\
      \ side bar which can be brought up, that way you could browse through the game\
      \ classes a lot easier. Maybe add something to display the custom classes and\
      \ where they sit on the class tree, Im not sure about the unrealated :o stuff\
      \ like the mapping stuff but for the code side of things I reckon this would\
      \ be a great feature.\n\n''OlympusMons: ok had a quick go but it seems as though\
      \ the 1.5 line must be a standard kinda thing, maybe its just the theme I got\
      \ on. Hmm well I think the whole thing would have to be reformatted to match,\
      \ I think its fine the way it is at the moment. While looking over some of the\
      \ formatting pages I saw that the hierarchy cant go 4 deep and still contain\
      \ links, dunno if this has been fixed etc. Ok now Ive found something I think\
      \ might be helpful take a look at [[:Category:Legacy Class Tree]] - see how\
      \ the pages with subfolders get indented, maybe something like this can be adapted\
      \ for a hierarchy type command. Just a suggestion anyway tell me what you think...''\n\
