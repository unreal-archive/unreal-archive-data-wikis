      \ on Unreal Wiki for would-be-scriptors to start if they have no programming\
      \ experience whatsoever. So I'll start an introduction to programming here.\
      \ \"Programming\" as it is discussed here will be OOP as that is the type of\

      \ you will not write a program. The program is already written. You will however\
      \ need to understand what that program is and how it is structured in order\

      \ and I want you to note its usage in that sentence. It may also be to bring\
      \ your attention to an important phrase. Also, note that the links provided\

      \ enough by the title of this page, there's more intended here then that. If\
      \ it's not obviouse enough by the content then what does it need? Note that\
      \ those pages on OOP will make no sense to a nonprogrammer. Anyone who is not\
      \ a nonprogrammer would have no interest in this page from the title other than\
      \ to contribute to it, or do... ummm... whatever you just did. =) Maybe there\
      \ needs to a subpage to this called \"<a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealScript_For_Non-Programmers/OOP_For_Nonprogrammers\"\

      \ on these subjects already available on the wiki, let's start by linking to\

      \ and abroad! A great next step, it shows you what's where on the wiki that\
      \ you will need. I could compose a long list of great places for you to visit\
      \ next, but I bet you would find those same links on the UnrealScript Topics\
      \ page.\n* [[Legacy:UnrealScript Lessons|UnrealScript Lessons]] &ndash; all\
      \ the UnrealScript tutorials\n* [[Legacy:UnrealScript|UnrealScript]] &ndash;\
      \ all the reference pages\n* [[Legacy:Mutator Topics|Mutator Topics]] &ndash;\
      \ more on mutators\n* [[Legacy:Making Mods|Making Mods]] &ndash; more on the\
      \ organizational and social aspects\n\n==Discussion ==\n\n'''CH3Z:''' This tutorial\
      \ needs a lot of imediate help. Please feel free to help it. I'm sure it needs\
      \ to be broken down to subpages, and anything you can add to it or change that\
      \ will help nonprogrammers get the idea of what they can do and how to get started\
      \ with unrealscript is welcome. This sat in my deleloper journal for yikes,\
      \ was it years??? Some of it is just plain junk, but it wasn't getting fixed\
      \ just sitting there. I need wikizen intervention to get this in shape. Now\
      \ that this tutorial is public, if it's not improved (hasn't been by me for\
      \ a LONG TIME) then it will my responsability to get rid of the whole thing\
      \ from the wiki as it will only be a confusing eye-sore if left as is.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ We already have a half-dozen \"introduction to OOP\" pages. I think we need\
      \ to standardize on one of them instead of creating new ones.\n\n'''CH3Z:'''\
      \ Obviouse enough by the title of this page, there's more intended here then\
      \ that. If it's not obviouse enough by the content then what does it need? Note\
      \ that those pages on OOP will make no sense to a nonprogrammer. Anyone who\
      \ is not a nonprogrammer would have no interest in this page from the title\
      \ other than to contribute to it, or do... ummm... whatever you just did. =)\
      \ Maybe there needs to a subpage to this called \"[[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/OOP\
      \ For Nonprogrammers]]\" with the info on OOP from this page put on it. I'll\
      \ try that and see where it leaves us.\n\n'''CH3Z:''' I'd have to say that was\
      \ a large step in... errr some direction anyway.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Regarding\
      \ the [[:Category:Legacy Delete Me]] request, I'd like more input from other\
      \ wiki users.  These pages seem, at the very least, well-intentioned, well-organized,\
      \ and well-linked.  If there are other, better guides and tuts on these subjects\
      \ already available on the wiki, let's start by linking to them from here. \
      \ Once we know what we have to work with, we can begin to refactor and restructure\
      \ it all.  I do appreciate the sentinment to clean the wiki, CH3Z.  Let's just\
      \ see if the info you've provided can be used in some way.\n\n----\n\nThis tut\
      \ is going nowhere. I (the author) will not be contributing to it anymore, and\
      \ it needs much much more. No one else is contributing to it, so it's a waste\
      \ of space and an eye-sore.[DeleteME]\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Personally, I believe\
      \ it would be better if it was kept.  It may not be finished, but at some point\
      \ people are bound to add to it.\n\n'''TkoDark''' I used one of comutergod666's\
      \ tutorials to add a weapon how do i delee it when i can't see it? Ued2.0"
