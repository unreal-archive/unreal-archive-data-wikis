      \ renders EVERYTHING in a zone beyond the zone portal. It is unlikely that it\
      \ is this latter option (which this page claims!) because that would lead to\

      \ then so will its zone portals to yet another zone, and so on, and soon, ALL\

      \ pun). We would have a zoning meltdown!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if we assume that\
      \ Antiportals work in a similar fashion to portals (except that they have the\
      \ opposite effect: occlude vs. un-occlude) then zone portals definitely take\
      \ into account the vectors from a player's camera, so this page is almost certainly\
      \ wrong, and should be fixed to match the information on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Map_Optimization\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Map Optimization\">Map Optimization</a> page. The rays from\

      <p><i>This section to be moved &amp; incorporated into <strong class=\"selflink\"\
      >Occlusion Changes For UnrealEngine2</strong></i></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"/Legacy:UT\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UT\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UT</a>, level optimization was primarily\
      \ about keeping the number of visible polygons to a sensible number (150 polygons\
      \ was considered about the most you wanted in view in the beginning, although\
      \ most PCs will handle 400 with ease these days). In addition the number of\
      \ visible objects (or meshes) needed to be kept to a minimum.</p>\n<p><a href=\"\
      /Legacy:BSP\" title=\"Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a> geometry (the only kind available\
      \ in <a href=\"/Legacy:UT\" title=\"Legacy:UT\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UT</a>)\
      \ automatically occluded things behind it. The tools available for ensuring\
      \ good map performance were <a href=\"/Legacy:Zoning\" title=\"Legacy:Zoning\"\
      >Zoning</a>, the simplification of comlpex areas of geometry, and hiding as\
      \ much BSP geometry and meshes behind other BSP geometry.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
      mw-headline\" id=\"A_Change_in_Occlusion_Behaviour\">A Change in Occlusion Behaviour</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Occlusion_Changes_For_UnrealEngine2?section=5\" title=\"\
      Edit section: A Change in Occlusion Behaviour\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>BSP before UT2003 occluded BSP (as well as meshes),\
      \ and the calculations for that were mostly done at map-build time by making\
      \ a data structure (tree). This is a data-structure approach as opposed to an\
      \ algorithmic approach, and was the entire point of BSP. The main algorithmic\
      \ aspect of BSP occlusion is comparing the players location against the nodes\
      \ of the tree at runtime, which is relatively cheap compared to most other occlusion\
      \ algorithms, and the reason for using BSP. But Epic decided to make BSP no\
      \ longer occludes BSP or meshes at all, leaving the occlusion up to the mapmaker.</p>\n\
      <p>Today, there are 3 methods for occlusion, and you can use all of them:</p>\n\
      <p>1) Use <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP\" title=\"Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a> mildly. It is\
      \ best for floors, simply-shaped walls, large chunks of simply-shaped buildings,\
      \ and so forth. BSP polygons do NOT occlude other BSP polygons, despite that\
      \ the whole point of the BSP algorithm is that. BSP vertices can not be cached\
      \ in the video card and instanced. Futhermore, BSP polygons are more slowly\
      \ rendered than static mesh polygons.</p>\n<p>2) Use <a href=\"/Legacy:Zone\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Zone\">Zones</a> as much as they make sense. But do not try\
      \ to zone areas that do not obviously look like zones, e.g. do not zone two\
      \ open adjacent areas since you will *worsen* the efficiency of occlusion processing.\
      \ Keep in mind that adjacent zones will occlude each others' meshes *except*\
      \ for those meshes which can \"seen\" by the client through a zone portal.</p>\n\
      <p>3) Use <a href=\"/Legacy:Antiportal\" title=\"Legacy:Antiportal\">Antiportals</a>\
      \ where zoning can not be used. Use them generously in outdoors areas.</p>\n\
      <p>4) Player fustrum. This is basically the \"line of sight\" of the player,\
      \ except of course that it is not a line, but rather a \"fustrum \" (perspective).\
      \ Whatever is not in the players 180* fustrum, is occluded.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\
