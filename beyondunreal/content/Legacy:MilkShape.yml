      <p><i>Article date 10/22/03</i></p>\n<p>MilkShape 3D (MS3D) is a 3D modeling\
      \ and animation toolbox designed for low-poly-count game content creation rather\
      \ than producing render-to-file still images or movies. It is strictly polygon-based\
      \ (triangles only – no quads), provides a good suite of capable, basic modeling\
      \ tools, and is easy to learn. Anyone with a smattering of 3D modeling experience\
      \ can begin making serious static meshes for UT2003 in the first hour or so\
      \ of using MS3D, and even raw beginners should have a fairly shallow learning\
      \ curve.</p>\n<p>MS3D's strong suit is that it is designed for modders, and\
      \ sports an extensive list of import/export options that make it valuable as\
      \ a \"translator\" app as well as one for creating original content. This allows\
      \ setting up content \"pipelines\" that wouldn't be possible otherwise (e.g.,\
      \ a wave-modulated banner modeled and animated in <a href=\"/Legacy:Gmax\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Gmax\">gmax</a>, exported to Quake III Arena .md3 format, imported into\
      \ MS3D, exported as .3ds, and made into a vertex animation for UT2003 using\
      \ the classic <a href=\"/Legacy:3ds2unr\" title=\"Legacy:3ds2unr\">3ds2unr</a>\
      \ utility).</p>\n<p>MS3D has some warts. Its interface is not particularly graceful,\
      \ though it is competent. It has only basic planar-mapping texturing tools,\
      \ requiring some extra effort for complex shapes, and takes a very \"hairy-eyeball\"\
      \ approach to texture placement – tweaks can be hard to get really accurate.\
      \ But with the ability to export MS3D models in dozens of formats, these limitations\
      \ can usually be offset by acquiring other tools to fill in where MS3D is less\
      \ useful (e.g., a mesh unwrapping/painting prog).</p>\n<p>MilkShape 3D is very\
      \ good for producing <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh\"\
      >static meshes</a> of low to intermediate complexity for <a href=\"/Legacy:UT2003\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UT2003\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UT2003</a> game content (see\
      \ examples below). When exported using one of the three <a href=\"/Legacy:Lightwave\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Lightwave\">Lightwave</a> LWO options (see pic below), the\
      \ exports can be imported directly into UEd 3's <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh_Browser\"\

      \ of greater complexity, freeware such as gmax can be used for the initial modeling,\
      \ then exported in a format MS3D can import (such as Quake III Arena .md3),\
      \ for tweaking and re-exporting in a UT2003-useable format like LWO. Meshes\

      \ Models bound in MS3D to the UT skeletons can probably be used for UT2003 (confirmation\
