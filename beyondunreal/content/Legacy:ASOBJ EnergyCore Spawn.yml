      \ like a weapon. While the defense cannot move the power core, if it is dropped\
      \ (if its carrier is killed) and 30 seconds (?) have passed, the power core\
      \ will be reset to its original location.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ objective and delivered to an ASOBJ_EnergyCore_Delivery once it's activated,\
