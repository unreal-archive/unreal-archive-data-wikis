      \ soon-to-be-imported model in _d.3d format (you don't need to alter the _a.3d\
      \ file, as it only contains the animation info), allowing you to select one\
      \ face (or poly), one material (or group of polies), all polies (or whole model),\
      \ and/or any amount in between.</p>\n<p>There are 2 ways to \"flag\" a poly:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>a style flag</li>\n<li>an fx flag</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A single poly can\
      \ have a style, or an fx, or both.</p>\n<p>These are the different flags that\
      \ can be set, and what they do:</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Styles\"\

      \ Blending</a> for these effects</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>2-sided&#160;</dt>\n<dd>this\
      \ applies the textue to both sides of the face(s). Good for flags, draped cloth,\
      \ cloaks on player models, etc.</dd>\n<dt>Translucent and 2-sided</dt>\n<dd>see\
      \ thru, must be 2-sided to avoid the HOM (hall of mirrors) effect. Good for\

      \ be invisible where masking color is placed. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Flags_(UT)\"\

      <p>Note that at least the Masked and 2-Sided flag (possibly more?) must be applied\
      \ to a whole material at once if you want it to work properly. Some renderers\
      \ (Glide, if I remember correctly) will do masking \"correctly\", but the D3D\
      \ and GL renderers have been known to get it wrong if a material has masking\
      \ on some polygons but not others. The workaround is as follows: if you want\
      \ any of (say) Material 2's polygons to be masked, <i>all</i> of Material 2's\
      \ polygons must be masked.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"FX\">FX</span><span\
