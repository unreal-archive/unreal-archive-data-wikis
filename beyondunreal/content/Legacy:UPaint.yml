      <p>Right now you've loaded the textures for your skin, you might want to edit\

      \ paint brush</b> tool (top tool on the left beneath the open files icon) and\
      \ simply drawing on one of the 2D textures on the left hand side, you will see\
      \ immediate results on the 3D model, unless of couse, you just painted on the\
      \ back of said model. To check this you'd want to rotate the model.</p>\n<p>Since\
      \ you have selected the <b>color paint brush</b>, clicking in the 3D view at\
      \ the moment will just paint on the texture (I'll get to that later) but since\
      \ you don't want to do that, look above the 3D view. There's some icons there.</p>\n\

  wikitext:
    text: "'''UPaint''' is a [[Legacy:Graphics Application|graphics application]]\
      \ used to help create the textures for the character models in [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]].\
      \ \n\n==Installation==\n\nTo install '''UPaint''' insert UT2003 CD 3, go to\
      \ the '''extras -> UPaint''' and click '''setup.exe'''. It will then copy the\
      \ UPaint program and the meshes, textures and characters from the CD to your\
      \ PC, by default to the '''Program Files\\Right Hemisphere\\UPaint''' folder.\n\
      \n==Patches==\n* http://ut2003master.epicgames.com/files/UPaint-patch-1.0.2.exe\
      \ \n\nList of features for patch 1.0.3: http://www.righthemisphere.com/forum/showthread.php3?s=b34cac69156dd0e929fa9d25ada6e843&threadid=891\
      \ (but it doesn't give a file link! :()\n\n===Changes in UPaint Patch 1.0.3===\n\
      * Improved (faster) CD detection for the UPAINT (3) CD.\n* Progress dialog bug-fix\
      \ for skin copying\n* Wording and clarity of dialogs improved.\n\n===Changes\
      \ in UPaint Patch 1.0.2 (included in 1.0.3)===\n\n* Fixed Win98/WinMe bug (aka:\
      \ can't open file bug)\n* Fixed crash with saving\n* Skins are now saved separately,\
      \ having a UTX and UPL per character\n** These two files are all you need to\
      \ trade characters.\n** However you can trade UPP and UPT files so you can continue\
      \ to paint on them.\n** Now to delete a skin, just delete its UTX and UPL files.\n\
      * [[Legacy:UTX File|UTX file]]s are now compressed\n\n==Interface==\n\nIt is\
      \ a pretty straight forward tool to use, it loads up with a toolbar on the left,\
      \ a few textures along the top (used in by the texture paint tool) and some\
      \ colours on the right of the screen,\n\n[[Image:Legacy_doog_blankinterface.png|center|The\
      \ blank interface on UPaint startup]]\n\nyou can then either open up one of\
      \ the characters from UT2003 pre-textured (*.upp filename found in the upaint/characters\
      \ folder) or a plain blank character model (*.psk filename found in the upaint/meshes\
      \ folder)\n\nIf you load up a pre-textured model, it will by default load the\
      \ head texture in 2D in the top left section, the body texture in 2D at bottom\
      \ left and a 3D rendered image on the right showing how the character will appear\
      \ in UT2003.\n\nIf you choose to load a plain blank character instead, the head\
      \ and body texture windows on the left will be empty and you will need to import\
      \ a texture into each to start painting on the model.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_doog_modelloaded.png|center|Mesh\
      \ (.psk file) loaded]]\n\n===Importing textures ===\n\nSupported image types\
      \ you can import are as follows:\n\n* BMP\n* IFF\n* JPG\n* JPEG\n* PNG\n* PNM\n\
      * PIX\n* RAW\n* TGA\n* TIF\n* TIFF\n* UPT\n* PCX\n\nTo import a texture, click\
      \ the box labeled 'Head' or 'Body', depending on which item you wish to import,\
      \ then go to '''file -> import texture''' and browse to '''upaint/textures''',\
      \ here are a set of textures used by the default characters from UT2003, helpfully\
      \ labelled with head and body in the names so you can see what's what. Click\
      \ a filename, then click open and it will load into the Head or Body section\
      \ and also display on the 3D image.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_doog_skinsimported.png|center|Skins\
      \ for Head and Body imported]]\n\nNotice all the textures in the Upaint/textures\
      \ folder are .PNG files? This is so that they can use the Alpha channel to tell\
      \ UT2003 which parts of the texture should be transparent. More on that later\
      \ :)\n\nYou don't have to use these textures though, by all means import your\
      \ own artwork, the program will allow you to import files of any size or dimension.\
      \ However, as I found to my dismay, it wont let you export the finished product\
      \ to UT2003 unless your textures are powers of 2. I find textures of '''1024*1024'''\
      \ work fine though, and are the same dimensions of the ones found in the '''UPaint/textures'''\
      \ folder. To fix this, open your image in PSP or any other graphics program\
      \ and resize it. Once done, import it again as above.\n\n===Moving around and\
      \ stuff ===\n\nRight now you've loaded the textures for your skin, you might\
      \ want to edit them so they look better. The simplest way to do this is by using\
      \ the '''color paint brush''' tool (top tool on the left beneath the open files\
      \ icon) and simply drawing on one of the 2D textures on the left hand side,\
      \ you will see immediate results on the 3D model, unless of couse, you just\
      \ painted on the back of said model. To check this you'd want to rotate the\
      \ model.\n\nSince you have selected the '''color paint brush''', clicking in\
      \ the 3D view at the moment will just paint on the texture (I'll get to that\
      \ later) but since you don't want to do that, look above the 3D view. There's\
      \ some icons there.\n\nThey are:\n\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_perspectiveicon.png|Legacy_doog_perspectiveicon.png]]\
      \ @inline@doog_headicon @inline@doog_bodyiceon View icons\n: Choose which view\
      \ you want this window to show, choices are '''Head'''. '''Body''' or '''Perspective'''\
      \ (3D)\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_Left.png|Legacy_doog_Left.png]] Left\n: Switches\
      \ the 3D view so that the model faces to the left\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_Right.png|Legacy_doog_Right.png]]\
      \ Right\n: Switches the 3D view so the model faces to the right\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_Front.png|Legacy_doog_Front.png]]\
      \ Front\n: Switches the 3D view to look at the model face on\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_Back.png|Legacy_doog_Back.png]]\
      \ Back\n: Switches the 3D view to look at the models back (hey, isn't this where\
      \ we want to look right now?)\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_Top.png|Legacy_doog_Top.png]]\
      \ Top\n: Switches the 3D view to look at the model from the top\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_Underneath.png|Legacy_doog_Underneath.png]]\
      \ M? Underneath\n: Switches the 3D view to look at the model from underneath\n\
      * [[Image:Legacy_doog_Perspectiveselected.png|Legacy_doog_Perspectiveselected.png]]\
      \ Perspective (shown selected)\n: Changes whatever view you have so that instead\
      \ of the model being shown flat, it has depth. Click it to see what I mean.\n\
      * [[Image:Legacy_doog_projectionpaint.png|Legacy_doog_projectionpaint.png]]\
      \ Projection paint\n: When you click it, a little loading bar appears for a\
      \ second or so, and then you can use the paint brush in the Perspective view,\
      \ to paint directly onto the mesh.  Click it again to turn this mode off.\n\
      * [[Image:Legacy_doog_rotate.png|Legacy_doog_rotate.png]] Rotate\n: This is\
      \ the doohicky we want to click so that left click and draging around in the\
      \ 3D view will rotate the model around.\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_zoom.png|Legacy_doog_zoom.png]]\
      \ Zoom\n: Draw a box in any of the three views and that section will be zoomed\
      \ in.\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_pan.png|Legacy_doog_pan.png]] Pan\n: Hold left\
      \ mouse button and drag around in any of the three views to move the image around,\
      \ usefull in 3D view if you don't want it rotating all the time.\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_fit.png|Legacy_doog_fit.png]]\
      \ Fit\n: makes the View zoom out (or in if you zoomed out a lot already) to\
      \ make the model fill up the window and be fully visible.\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_wireframe.png|Legacy_doog_wireframe.png]]\
      \ Wireframe\n: Displays the models wireframe mesh superimposed over the texture\
      \ (handily as I just this second noticed, each 2D view also has this icon which\
      \ unwraps the mesh on the texture so you can see what bit's you're drawing on\
      \ easier)\n* [[Image:Legacy_doog_lit.png|Legacy_doog_lit.png]] Lit\n: Turns\
      \ off model lighting (removes shadows) - it's on by default.\n\nAnother thing\
      \ I found out while playing, with the rotate tool selected, while left dragging\
      \ rotates the model, right dragging zooms it in and out and holding both mouse\
      \ buttons and dragging pans it left-right, up-down. If you have a third mouse\
      \ button (or wheel) holding that will also pan around while using the mouse\
      \ wheel roller will zoom in and out. (pan and zoom both work in the 2D views\
      \ too)\n\n==External Links==\n* Anytime you need help on trying to get UPaint\
      \ to work, you can always stop by the [http://www.righthemisphere.com/forum/forumdisplay.php3?s=&forumid=98\

      \ this page a bit but I need to figure out some stuff first. Until then here\
      \ is an official link to the latest Upaint:\n\nhttp://ut2003master.epicgames.com/files/UPaint-patch-1.0.2.exe\
      \ \n\nNote that I had trouble as did others with an early file downloaded from\
      \ there, but that supposedly the installer has been fixed by Right Hemisphere\
      \ (the makers of Upaint). Whether this change has actually occured or been propagated\
      \ to the Epicgames server (which that link is to) is unconfirmed (by me at least).\
      \  The forums Kirin has linked are somewhat useful but RH doesn't seem to update\
      \ people much as to what is going on.  \n\nNote someone should '''link ChiQ's\
      \ shader tutorial from here''', if they know the link.\n\nNoticed the Projection\
      \ paint image button is missing? I didn't touch that (or anything BTW) so maybe\
      \ the image is missing?\n\n'''Doogle:''' Thanks, I missed that one when uploading,\
      \ not been here in the past couple of days due to bein ill so I'll do some more\
      \ for this after work tomorrow :)\n\n'''mrbond113:''' Any chance that this would\
      \ work for UT, too?\n\n'''Radiosity:''' No, because UT doesn't use .psk files,\
      \ as it uses vertex animation not skeletal (with the exception of the later\
      \ skeletal support that was added, but that still works differently to the UT2003\
      \ onwards method).\n\n'''Radiosity:''' Anyone using UPaint should be aware that\
