      \ navigation/info boxes (an example can be found e.g. on <a href=\"/Literals\"\

      \ disconnect with Legacy content. This discussion will likely last a while and\
      \ not get the input of the entire wiki community. Seeing as I was an instrumental\
      \ contributor of the old organization (which has been widely criticized as poor\

      >Haarg</a> 21:32, 3 April 2008 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Well I guess my biggest\
      \ concern is the wealth of existing information (namely the tutorials and class\
      \ hierarchy pages) that we can't simply move over. Most if not all the pages\
      \ have had at least one contributor to the page that has done at least a minor\
      \ edit. Then there's the problem of not having a complete history of the older\
      \ pages so while it may appear that only one individual has worked on a given\
      \ page, the truth could be that at least two have worked on it but the history\
      \ of the page has been lost. Then theres the problem of what we can do with\
      \ new content for the older engines as we cannot add new content to these legacy\
      \ pages. IMO, the class hierarchy at least could be moved over as most of the\
      \ pages are simply descriptions of what the class does (which really, Copyrights\
      \ should have no hold over because there's only so many ways you can describe\
      \ what a class is responsible for) and have listings for each method and variable\
      \ and what they're used for.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>If that really is not an\
      \ option then we could go through class by class and (re-) create a class page\
      \ for each of them by source. So we could have a category for each game and\
      \ have a hierarchy of classes from each package. It <b>would</b> take a fair\
      \ bit of time to complete and a decent format would need to be made up. I personally\
      \ didn't like how the old formats were set up. It seemed like too much information\
      \ was being thrown at you for classes such as Actor, where there are a lot of\
      \ variables and methods to go through. I guess we'd have to look at how much\
      \ more information we could add in the end. I'm not sure how 'definitive' our\
      \ class pages were, but I'm positive we didn't have many pages for certain classes.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>On the topic of tutorials, is there any reason why we can't\
      \ re-write them? If a tutorial explains how to make a new weapon based on the\
      \ shock rifle (which has been over done already) we could just reinvent the\
      \ wheel. The other more advanced tutorials (such as the RPG Class tutorials)\
      \ could be re-written with a similar basis.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>In the end,\
      \ I think keeping the older content up-to-date and easy to find/navigate through\
      \ is important as many level designers and modders most likely have not moved\
      \ over to UE3 and UE2 still has plenty of life left in it.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\

      \ 12:03, 4 April 2008 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>Most of the class hierarchy could be\
      \ moved over or recreated pretty simply. As for tutorials, rewriting them is\

      \ (UTC)</dd>\n<dd>A comment on user accounts: It probably could have been explained\
      \ better, but the user accounts from the old wiki weren't converted to the new\
      \ software. First, I somewhat doubt it would have been possibly technically\
      \ But mainly, there was barely any information attached to the old accounts\
      \ that have been worth keeping. So everyone has to create new user accounts.\

      \ 17:17, 5 April 2008 (UTC)\n<dl>\n<dd>I think its a great idea. Its a good\
      \ anti-spam addition that works well for the most part, although it could end\
      \ up generating a lot of accounts that would only be used once (as I've found\
      \ a lot of people often to go to a site where they need to sign up to contribute\
      \ and only ever change one thing they've found). Also, spam bots have been known\

      <p>Secondly I was comparing the Actor class of UT2003 with that of UT2004 and\
      \ there are several differences in each. I think we should have at least one\
      \ Actor page for each generation but what about games within the same generation?\
      \ Should we have seperate Actor pages for UT2003 and UT2004 within the UE2 namespace\
      \ or UT2003/UT2004 namespaces or should we have one full page for UT2004 and\
      \ have a seperate page for the Actor class in UT2003 that just sites the major\
      \ differences? -<a href=\"/User:DalinSeivewright\" title=\"User:DalinSeivewright\"\
      >DalinSeivewright</a> 01:32, 15 April 2008 (UTC)</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>Well on the\
      \ topic of UE2 Id think the best option might be to have a seperate section\
      \ relating to UE2.5 since its an upgrade on the engine. Both UT2003 and UT2004\
      \ are UE2 though but other engines picked up support at UE2.5 where some are\
      \ based on UE2. I do know there was alittle bit of a hastle with the class tree\
      \ pages because it contained info from both UE2-2.5 so each difference had to\
      \ be tagged. I guess it wasnt so bad since some classes are identical between\
      \ the two, the last idea sounds good to me to do full page on UT2004's Actor\
      \ and a differences page for UT2003. - <a href=\"/User:OlympusMons\" title=\"\

      <dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<dl>\n<dd>I actually change my mind. I think we should have\
      \ an actor page for each version of the engine/game. This would be considerably\
      \ more work (unless Wormbo finishes his class wikifier?) but it would be much\
      \ 'cleaner' and dare I say sexier. Plus users won't be too confused on whether\
      \ or not their on the right page if the page just sites the differences. -<a\

      \ agree with Dalin here. Each \"game\" (including UE2Runtime) gets its own set\

      \ include the newest game's version of the page on all older games' versions\

      <p>I dont know where to add mod ideas...</p>\n<p><br />\nThe mod ideas section\
      \ didn't really work out on the old wiki, IMHO. Would it really make sense to\

      \ and wasn't going to add it to the main page, but then I thought I'd add it\
      \ anyways and see what anyone else thought. The old Mod ideas was an okay source\
      \ for ideas but it ended up being a list of abandoned pages with half being\
      \ discussions on the Mod idea itself and the other half being discussions on\
      \ the progress of the mod, as if it was no longer an open source idea but being\
      \ worked on. I'm fine with not reviving the page, but where would these mod\
      \ ideas go now? -<a href=\"/User:DalinSeivewright\" title=\"User:DalinSeivewright\"\

      \ reworked? If a user has a great concept and someone came and used that idea\
      \ down to the exact details would there be any problems/need to cite references\

      \ if there should be a seperate license for the idea pages, or if there would\

      \ problem I can't solve.</p>\n<p>I am trying to make a vehicle, with a Battering\
      \ Ram. I have the Vehicle, what I need is the Battering Ram. My idea was to\
      \ take the static mesh from the Shock Tank Shield, resized and converted to\
      \ my vehicle static mesh package, and use it as a Projectile, that travels a\
      \ very short distance, at a high rate of speed and Batters whatever it hits\
      \ and stops projectiles like a shield. It works, my problem is though, when\
      \ it is aimed low, it disappears. It is still there as far as hammering actors,\
      \ and other momentum/damage effects, but there is no visibility.</p>\n<p>I've\
      \ tried making it in over 5 different ways now, projectile, emitter, pawn, actor,\
      \ u name it, i tried it, all worked but with same disappearing act. I suspect\
      \ it has something to do with collision size, but i've tried it with or without,\
      \ and nothing seems to work. I used the Shield Shader as the Texture, Have collision\
      \ of texture true, tried using other meshes, even a square, Even recoded the\
      \ whole gun to use the shield from the Shock Tank, with redone emitter effect\
      \ just to see and even the emitter effect said \"GoodBye!\".</p>\n<p>I'd put\
      \ up the code I last used but it's basically the Projectile Code, altered to\
      \ launch the static mesh and right now has every collision property i could\
      \ find, in defaults, set to true.</p>\n<p>So if someone finds the idea interesting,\
      \ or you're just bored, ANY help is Good Help...</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<dl>\n\

      \ 06:31, 13 March 2008 (EDT)\n\nActually, we need to come up with an easy-to-browse\
      \ structure for overview pages of the various parts of Unreal modding. The problem\
      \ here will be that either this kind of page tends to get too long or there\
      \ are too many pages to click through before reaching actual content. We need\
      \ to find a good mix between an sophisticated structure and quick access. The\
      \ topic pages can be accompanied by [[Project:categories|categories]], navigation/info\
      \ boxes (an example can be found e.g. on [[Literals]]) and disambiguation links/pages\
      \ for when a user uses the Go button of the search box in the sidebar. I hope\
      \ this will give you an overview of the new tools we can use to structure the\
      \ Unreal Wiki. -[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]] 07:58, 16 April 2008 (UTC)\n\nI think\
      \ we can now all agree this should have been discussed openly and decided much\
      \ earlier, before the switch to MediaWiki and the subsequent disconnect with\
      \ Legacy content.  This discussion will likely last a while and not get the\
      \ input of the entire wiki community.  Seeing as I was an instrumental contributor\
      \ of the old organization (which has been widely criticized as poor or no organization),\
      \ I will step back, keep an eye on the progress and wait for the dust to settle.\
      \  Good luck. -[[User:SuperApe|SuperApe]] 08:57 PST, 16 April 2008\n\nUnder\

      \ here will deal with UnrealScript, why not change it and the category to UnrealScript\
      \ Tutorials? -[[User:DalinSeivewright|DalinSeivewright]] 15:14, 17 April 2008\

      \ 22:49, 17 April 2008 (UTC)\n\nThose tree widgets only show subcategories,\
      \ not pages or media. Just imagine [[:Category:UT2004-specific classes]] displaying\
      \ all old UT2004 classes when you expand its subcategory [[:Category:Legacy\
      \ Class (UT2004)]]! If you mean the actual categories, don't worry. I'll import\

      \ should save alot of time. :)\nActually on the Topic of class tree's since\
      \ Im there, whats going to happen in that respect now? Are we going to have\
      \ a class tree page anymore? I imagine alot can be done with tree views now\

      \n:Double post looolz, anyways to expand on class tree's I had a play over here:\
      \ [[Unreal_Wiki:Sandbox|Sandbox]] but I think it'll need its own template or\
      \ something and Im not well versed on this new wiki stuff just yet. This category\
      \ list shows the pages though under the categories they fall but I couldnt get\
      \ the parent class showing as a category which is why I thought it'd need a\

      == New wiki software / Organization ==\nVarious people have had questions, comments,\
      \ or criticisms of this move to MediaWiki.  This seems as good a place as any\
      \ to discuss it, so feel free to add anything here. – [[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 21:32,\
      \ 3 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n:Well I guess my biggest concern is the wealth of existing\
      \ information (namely the tutorials and class hierarchy pages) that we can't\
      \ simply move over.  Most if not all the pages have had at least one contributor\
      \ to the page that has done at least a minor edit.  Then there's the problem\
      \ of not having a complete history of the older pages so while it may appear\
      \ that only one individual has worked on a given page, the truth could be that\
      \ at least two have worked on it but the history of the page has been lost.\
      \  Then theres the problem of what we can do with new content for the older\
      \ engines as we cannot add new content to these legacy pages.  IMO, the class\
      \ hierarchy at least could be moved over as most of the pages are simply descriptions\
      \ of what the class does (which really, Copyrights should have no hold over\
      \ because there's only so many ways you can describe what a class is responsible\
      \ for) and have listings for each method and variable and what they're used\
      \ for.\n\n:If that really is not an option then we could go through class by\
      \ class and (re-) create a class page for each of them by source.  So we could\
      \ have a category for each game and have a hierarchy of classes from each package.\
      \  It '''would''' take a fair bit of time to complete and a decent format would\
      \ need to be made up.  I personally didn't like how the old formats were set\
      \ up.  It seemed like too much information was being thrown at you for classes\
      \ such as Actor, where there are a lot of variables and methods to go through.\
      \  I guess we'd have to look at how much more information we could add in the\
      \ end.  I'm not sure how 'definitive' our class pages were, but I'm positive\
      \ we didn't have many pages for certain classes.\n\n:On the topic of tutorials,\
      \ is there any reason why we can't re-write them?  If a tutorial explains how\
      \ to make a new weapon based on the shock rifle (which has been over done already)\
      \ we could just reinvent the wheel.  The other more advanced tutorials (such\
      \ as the RPG Class tutorials) could be re-written with a similar basis.\n\n\
      :In the end, I think keeping the older content up-to-date and easy to find/navigate\
      \ through is important as many level designers and modders most likely have\
      \ not moved over to UE3 and UE2 still has plenty of life left in it. \n\n:-[[User:DalinSeivewright|DalinSeivewright]]\
      \ 12:03, 4 April 2008 (UTC)\n::Most of the class hierarchy could be moved over\
      \ or recreated pretty simply.  As for tutorials, rewriting them is probably\
      \ the best solution.  While that may seem like wasted effort, I don't see a\
      \ better solution given the licensing issues.  – [[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 17:17,\

      \ I somewhat doubt it would have been possibly technically  But mainly, there\
      \ was barely any information attached to the old accounts that have been worth\

      \  Its a good anti-spam addition that works well for the most part, although\

      \ up to contribute and only ever change one thing they've found).  Also, spam\

      \ 02:36, 6 April 2008 (UTC)\n\nTwo things.  Having the Legacy article show up\
      \ in the search kind of makes it look incredibly messy, unorganized and hard\
      \ to follow.  I understand that its important to stress that Users probably\
      \ shouldn't do major edits to Legacy pages but somehow hiding the Legacy part\
      \ of the article name would help things considerably.\n\nSecondly I was comparing\
      \ the Actor class of UT2003 with that of UT2004 and there are several differences\
      \ in each.  I think we should have at least one Actor page for each generation\
      \ but what about games within the same generation?  Should we have seperate\
      \ Actor pages for UT2003 and UT2004 within the UE2 namespace or UT2003/UT2004\
      \ namespaces or should we have one full page for UT2004 and have a seperate\
      \ page for the Actor class in UT2003 that just sites the major differences?\
      \ -[[User:DalinSeivewright|DalinSeivewright]] 01:32, 15 April 2008 (UTC)\n:Well\
      \ on the topic of UE2 Id think the best option might be to have a seperate section\
      \ relating to UE2.5 since its an upgrade on the engine. Both UT2003 and UT2004\
      \ are UE2 though but other engines picked up support at UE2.5 where some are\
      \ based on UE2. I do know there was alittle bit of a hastle with the class tree\
      \ pages because it contained info from both UE2-2.5 so each difference had to\
      \ be tagged. I guess it wasnt so bad since some classes are identical between\
      \ the two, the last idea sounds good to me to do full page on UT2004's Actor\
      \ and a differences page for UT2003. - [[User:OlympusMons|OlympusMons]]\n\n\
      :::I actually change my mind.  I think we should have an actor page for each\
      \ version of the engine/game.  This would be considerably more work (unless\
      \ Wormbo finishes his class wikifier?) but it would be much 'cleaner' and dare\
      \ I say sexier.  Plus users won't be too confused on whether or not their on\
      \ the right page if the page just sites the differences.  -[[User:DalinSeivewright|DalinSeivewright]]\
      \ 00:11, 17 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n::::Might be the go hey since there are sometimes\
      \ differences between builds as well so it might get very confusing later, duplicating\

      \ nature of UE. -[[User:OlympusMons|OlympusMons]] 22:51, 17 April 2008 (UTC)\n\
      \n:::I agree with Dalin here. Each \"game\" (including UE2Runtime) gets its\
      \ own set of class pages and corresponding categories. If the classes really\
      \ have exactly the same content, we can take advantage of the template features\
      \ and simply include the newest game's version of the page on all older games'\
      \ versions of the same page. I already demonstrated this on [[UE2:DMRosterBeatTeam\
      \ (UT2003)]], which only includes the content from [[UE2:DMRosterBeatTeam (UT2004)]].\
      \ The templates [[Template:Infobox class]] (and [[Template:Infobox class part]])\
      \ and [[Template:samegame]] used there automatically set up links to point to\
      \ pages of the same game.<br/>On a semi-related note: Do we want to document\
      \ defaultproperties, possibly including subobjects, on the class pages? -[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]]\
      \ 08:35, 21 April 2008 (UTC)\n\n::::I'm in favor of having any documentation\
      \ of the default properties in where the variables are documented (if at all).\
      \  It would seem reasonable to have the 'default' or accepted values for a given\

      \ should be included too, just as long as we can have a seperate page for that\

      \ and use it as a Projectile, that travels a very short distance, at a high\
      \ rate of speed and Batters whatever it hits and stops projectiles like a shield.\
      \ It works, my problem is though, when it is aimed low, it disappears. It is\
      \ still there as far as hammering actors, and other momentum/damage effects,\
      \ but there is no visibility.\n\nI've tried making it in over 5 different ways\
      \ now, projectile, emitter, pawn, actor, u name it, i tried it, all worked but\
      \ with same disappearing act. I suspect it has something to do with collision\
      \ size, but i've tried it with or without, and nothing seems to work. I used\
      \ the Shield Shader as the Texture, Have collision of texture true, tried using\
      \ other meshes, even a square, Even recoded the whole gun to use the shield\
      \ from the Shock Tank, with redone emitter effect just to see and even the emitter\
      \ effect said \"GoodBye!\". \n\nI'd put up the code I last used but it's basically\
      \ the Projectile Code, altered to launch the static mesh and right now has every\
      \ collision property i could find, in defaults, set to true.\n\nSo if someone\
      \ finds the idea interesting, or you're just bored, ANY help is Good Help...\n\
      \n\n:Honestly, for \"interactive\" modding help you should really ask in a forum.\
      \ The Unreal Wiki is more of a reference site. If you are looking for or want\
      \ to help writing tutorials, then this is the place for you. —[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]]\

      \ the Unreal IRC channels such as #UnrealScript and #UnrealWiki? on the main\
      \ page, perhaps there is and i didn't see it but in that case it should be moved\
      \ so people will see it. --Eliot 22:39, 17 July 2010 (UTC)\n\n== \"Modding\"\
      \ section ==\n\nWhat exactly is the point of that section? I mean, modding is\
      \ the act of modifying a game. You can do so by creating custom levels (\"Mapping\"\
      ), custom models (\"Modeling\") or changing the rules on any scale from small\
      \ additions to a totally new game (\"Programming\"). And apart from that obvious\
      \ ambiguity - check out [[Modding overview], it's a joke. —[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]]\n\
      \n:yeah I dont know what the purpose of it was (I went ahead and removed it,\
      \ revert if needed anyways), maybe it was some sort of section to combine all\
      \ three sections but this can be done in a much better fashion if required in\
      \ tutorials. Using a basic proceedure approach to tutorials though each of the\
      \ smaller tutorials would reside in their apropriate sections, mapping, modeling\
      \ or programming, cool --[[User:00zX|00zX]] 08:57, 2 August 2010 (UTC)\n\n==IRC?==\n\
      What the heck does IRC stand for, and why don't any of the links do anything\
      \ when I click them? Yours truly [[User:UnrealMuskrat|UnrealMuskrat]] 00:06,\
      \ 20 June 2014 (UTC)\n\n:IRC means [[wp:Internet Relay Chat|Internet Relay Chat]].\
      \ It's an old, yet still quite popular chat protocol for which you need a special\
      \ client. Thunderbird can do it natively, there's ChatZilla for Firefox, there\
      \ are many dedicated programs like mIRC and multi-protocol chat programs like\
      \ Miranda, Pidgin or Trillian. —[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]] 14:36, 20 June 2014 (UTC)\n\
      \nCool, chats are awesome, pretty cool how you've got 4 to choose from. I'll\
      \ have to learn how to get these things working for me, I love to chat. Yours\

      \ File Reference List ==\nWhat I need for publishing map packages is a list\
      \ of stock and non stock files for UT with respect to the UT versions and addons/bonus\
      \ packs. Usually I use [http://www.birrabrothers.com/drac/index.php?dsps=145\
      \ birrabrothers.com] and a clean fresh UT installation to find that out. Wouldn't\
      \ be the Wiki a matching place for such a collection? --[[User:SeriousBarbie|SeriousBarbie]]\
      \ ([[User talk:SeriousBarbie|talk]]) 18:58, 29 December 2015 (EST)\n:IIRC we\
      \ do have such lists for particular types of packages. A complete file list\
      \ is probably more admin-related than modding-related and thus should maybe\
      \ belong in the [[uadmin:|Unreal Admin Wiki]]. —[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]] 19:34,\
