      <p>I'm a casual mapper who loves the Unreal series. I like originality in maps,\
      \ especially in gameplay. I played UT, UT2004, and UT3; I like UT2004 and UT3\
      \ equally (except for the menu systems...) and will probably switch to mapping\
      \ for UT3. I am very active on the BUF mapping forum, and somewhat active on\
      \ other sites. Also, I am a map reviewer at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
