      \ as you play? Use \"G\" to toggle visibility of all non-game actors.</li>\n\
      <li>Want a quick radiosity type bounce light? Hold \"Ctrl+L\" and click on a\
      \ surface in the preview window. A dim light will be created at that location,\
      \ with the color preset to match the surface you clicked on.</li>\n<li>Speed\
      \ up your in editor navigation performance by toggling the \"Unlit Movement\"\
      \ icon on your preview window. When moving your camera, the view will be in\
      \ the faster unlit mode. When you stop moving, the view will revert to full\
      \ lighting.</li>\n<li>Want to center your viewports on a selected object? Hit\
      \ the \"Home\" key to focus on a selected actor or actors.</li>\n<li>Lots of\
      \ streaming submaps in your level? Right click on any actor and hit \"M\" to\
      \ make the level containing that actor \"current\".</li>\n<li>Moving, Rotating,\
      \ and Scaling actors often with the widget? Use the spacebar to cycle between\
      \ modes.</li>\n<li>Is that actor important to scripting? Hit \"K\" to toggle\
      \ \"Kismet References\" in a viewport. Any actor that is referenced in Kismet\
      \ will have a green box or brackets around it (depending on if it belongs to\
      \ the current level). Right click on one any of those actors and you have the\
      \ option to \"Find Actor in Kismet\" to see how it's being used.</li>\n<li>What\
      \ package is this asset in? Right click on an actor such as a mesh and select\
      \ \"Sync Generic Browser\" to see that asset in the Generic Browser window.</li>\n\
      <li>Always swapping between browser tabs? Float it! Select a frequently used\
      \ browser tab such as \"Actor Classes\" and under the \"Docking\" menu select\
      \ \"Floating\" to remove it from the main browser window. This is great for\
      \ resizing that window to better accommodate that type of data.</li>\n<li>Got\
      \ a floating object you want on the ground? Select it and press the \"end\"\
      \ key to drop that object to the surface beneath it.</li>\n<li>Don't forget\
      \ to \"Check map for errors\" periodically under the editor's \"Tool\" menu.\
      \ This will show you all kinds of useful information. Double click on a warning\
      \ entry to zoom to that actor's location for a quick fix.</li>\n<li>Quickly\
      \ add and subtract the builder brush from your level's BSP by using \"Ctrl+A\"\
      \ and \"Ctrl+S\".</li>\n<li>Making rows of duplicate objects? Select an actor\
      \ and hold \"Alt\" before dragging the object to modify the object and leave\
      \ a duplicate behind (release Alt between clones).</li>\n<li>Need to place lots\
      \ of a specific actor type? In the \"Actor Classes\" browser, select an object\
      \ such as \"PathNode\". Now hold the \"A\" key while clicking on surfaces in\
      \ your preview window, this will drop an actor of the selected type with every\
      \ mouse click.</li>\n<li>Not a fan of the widget? Move an actor using Ctrl+LeftMouseDrag.\
      \ Rotate an actor with Ctrl+RightMouseDrag. The widget can be hidden with the\
      \ \"Show/Use the widget\" icon in the main toolbar.</li>\n<li>Need a specific\
      \ sized builder brush? Right click on a brush icon such as the cube to enter\
      \ numeric values.</li>\n<li>In many numeric property fields you can input simple\
      \ equations. Enter \"512+1280-32\" into a light's radius property for example.</li>\n\
      <li>Adjusting a radius? Skip the properties window and use the \"scale\" widget\
      \ to adjust the radius visually. If it's an object like a trigger, a quick \"\
      C\" toggle will show its collision for a more precise scaling operation.</li>\n\
      <li>Want to select a brush itself, and not just the surface? Hold \"Ctrl+Shift\"\
      \ when you click the brush's surface.</li>\n<li>Want to see only your core BSP\
      \ in a level? Use \"H\" to toggle visibility of everything except brushwork\
      \ in a viewport.</li>\n<li>I wish this actor lived in another sublevel! Just\
      \ select the actor(s) in question, right click on one, and select \"Move Selected\
      \ Actors To Current Level\" to relocate the actors out of their previous sublevels\
      \ and into the current sublevel. Ctrl+M is the shortcut for this.</li>\n<li>Want\
      \ a brush already in your level to become your builder brush? Select the brush\
      \ and hit \"Ctrl+P\".</li>\n<li>Convert a mesh's simplified collision to a builder\
      \ brush by right clicking on it, and under the \"Convert\" options you'll find\
      \ the \"Convert Collision Model To Brush\" action.</li>\n<li>Want to sort your\
      \ sublevels in the level browser? Select a level and use the Up and Down keys\
      \ to reorganize them. This works is several other list-type browsers as well.</li>\n\
      <li>Need a quick measurement? Just drag with your middle mouse button in a viewport\
      \ to pull up the in-editor ruler.</li>\n<li>Box select objects by holding Ctrl+Shift\
      \ when you left-drag your mouse, do the same with the right mouse button to\
      \ box deselect and area.</li>\n<li>Wish you knew all the hotkeys for hiding\
      \ and showing different types of actors? Above each viewport is a pulldown menu\
      \ labeled \"Toggle Show Flags\". Within that pulldown is a list of letters and\
      \ what they correspond to in the viewport.</li>\n<li>UnrealEd now has spinners\
      \ to edit values. In most numeric property fields you can select the field,\
      \ and spinner controls will appear next to the number, allowing you to adjust\
      \ the value by clicking and dragging.</li>\n<li>Want to rearrange a workspace\
      \ such as kismet? Many workspaces now feature docking, allowing you to better\
      \ customize your working area. In Kismet, as one example, you can click on the\
      \ title of a field such as \"properties\" and drag it around within the Kismet\
      \ window. It will lock to the sides of windows, and can even be completely removed\
      \ from the original workspace.</li>\n<li>Wish your builder brush or volume was\
      \ a solid instead of wireframe? The red icon in the top tool paned labeled \"\
      Toggle Brush Polys\" will display the selected geometry filled with translucent\
      \ polygons, allowing you better visualization of where your volume exists in\
      \ the gamespace.</li>\n<li>Don't forget you can change your camera's movement\
      \ speed with the three blue icons in the main toolbar. This makes navigating\
      \ large maps much easier</li>\n<li>Want to warp around your environment quickly?\
      \ Place bookmarks. In the tradition of many RTS games, you can hold Ctrl+ any\
      \ number key to place a bookmark at that location. Now just hit the number key\
      \ again and the camera will return to the position stored. Drop bookmarks in\
      \ your major areas and save yourself a load of repetitive dragging.</li>\n<li>Organize\
      \ large sets of actors into groups. Open the group browser, create a new group,\
      \ name it, and everything you currently have selected will be part of that group.\
      \ You can add actors to it, take them away, and most importantly hide them easily.\
      \ A duplicated object will have the same group properties as the object it was\
      \ created from.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.025\
