      </pre>\n<p>If you didn't install the second CD textures, disable the line UseS3TC\
      \ textures by changing it to read&#160;: <b>UseS3TC=0</b>. Also, up the RefreshRate\
      \ line to the max refresh rate your monitor can take at the res. you're running\
      \ UT at. Don't forget to disable VSync, both in the Driver Options of the Detonator's\
      \ (right click on the Desktop -&gt; preferences etc.) as well as in the UT options\
      \ (in the menu once UT has started up type <b>preferences</b> in the system\
