      \ the BU coding forum and is interesting because it needs general insight on\
      \ how acceleration and speed are done on vehicles in general. To find out about\
      \ this, an important function to observe is the following function taken from\
      \ the <a href=\"/Legacy:KCar\" title=\"Legacy:KCar\">KCar</a> class:</p>\n<div\

      </div>\n<p>It calculates the torque of the wheels using Throttle (player presses\
      \ up or down), the gear (forwards or backwards) and the wheel spin speed in\
      \ combination with a torque curve. The calculated torque is in its turn applied\
      \ to the KMotorTorque property of the <a href=\"/Legacy:KCarWheelJoint\" title=\"\
      Legacy:KCarWheelJoint\">KCarWheelJoint</a> associated with every tire (<a href=\"\
      /Legacy:KTire\" title=\"Legacy:KTire\">KTire</a>.WheelJoint). So to increase\
      \ the maximum speed of the Bulldog or its acceleration, we only need to change\
      \ the TorqueCurve. This can be done in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Default_Properties\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Default Properties\">Default Properties</a> of a (user written)\
      \ subclass by overriding the default value in the Bulldog class.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ default value for TorqueCurve in the Bulldog class is:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"\

      <dd><b>Note:</b> If you are using UnrealEd you can't see the default properties\
      \ section of the class in it's source. Instead, you can right-click the class\
      \ in the class tree and choose 'Default Properties...'. The above value will\
      \ be under the KCar rollout.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Basically this value of TorqueCurve\
      \ means the acceleration will be constant while wheel spin speed is between\
      \ 0 and 200000, and that it will linearly decrease between 200000 and 300000.\
      \ For RPM, these values will probably need to be divided by 65535 (see <a href=\"\
      http://udn.epicgames.com/Two/KarmaReference\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"udn2:KarmaReference\"\
      >udn2:KarmaReference</a>). The InterpCurveEval function will probably work the\
      \ three coordinates in a curve so the actual \"wheel-spin -&gt; torque\" relation\
      \ will be a somewhat smoothed out version.</p>\n<p>To <b>increase the maximum\
      \ speed</b> of the Bulldog, you can simply make the torque last on higher wheel\
      \ spin speeds by increasing the last two InVal numbers.</p>\n<p>To <b>increase\
      \ the acceleration</b> of the Bulldog, you can increase the value of the OutVal\
      \ properties. This will not have a very noticable effect though, because the\
      \ wheels will slid very much. But decreasing acceleration works very well.</p>\n\
      <p>Be carefull though, the Bulldog is not build on such high speeds. The front\
      \ wheels will quickly lift from the air and make steering impossible, and you'll\
      \ run into some rock eventually and fly miles away. Of course, the steering\
      \ problem could in its turn be worked around by deviding the weight of the Bulldog\
      \ to have more mass in the front. Something that could be covered in a tutorial\
      \ on coding <a href=\"/Legacy:Karma\" title=\"Legacy:Karma\">Karma</a> objects\
      \ I think.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Using_the_TorqueCurves_for_Gears\"\

      <p><b>Note</b> To do this you need to subclass the Bulldog, you cant do this\
      \ when you place a bulldog or something.</p>\n<p>The Curve can be build with\
      \ as much points as you want. All points consist of 2 pairs the InVal and OutVal\
      \ as shown above. The Outval is the acceleration the vehicle will have, the\
      \ Inval specify's the wheelspin range for what this OutVal is valid for. Check\
      \ the above examples for more info on this.</p>\n<p>This means that the acceleration\
      \ will always be only attached to the wheelspin. With gears you want to simulate\
      \ the loss of acceleration when the car drives too slow for that gear, this\
      \ can't be done with one Curve.</p>\n<p>Think of this as Gears in a car where\
      \ you actually change the gear to get a better Curve for that speed.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ best way to do that is to specify multiple gear ratios.</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"\

      <p><b>Note</b> The actual speed of the vehicle is based primairly on the Torque\

      \ same, you will drive faster because very simply the rotation stays the same.</p>\n\
      <p>I hope this helps some people.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Bjorn for giving this info\
      \ in the first place, helped me out a lot</p>\n<p><b>Birelli:</b> If I'm reading\
      \ the above code right, it needs a slight tweak in that you can't both multiply\
      \ by the current gear AND reference the correct torque curve with it, unless\
      \ your torque curves are all going to take into account the fact that when you\
      \ kick the bulldog into second gear you're going to automatically double the\
      \ torque. I think if you actually used that code above it would be readily apparent\
      \ that there was a problem with it the first time you shifted gears and your\
      \ acceleration suddenly doubled&#160;;).</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Actually the\
      \ approximate speed of the vehicle is based on the rate at which the wheels\
      \ are turning multiplied by their radius, multiplied by the \"coefficient of\
      \ traction\" which is some mangled native version of the friction of the wheels\
      \ on the ground. Torque causes the wheels to accelerate. They will cease accelerating\
      \ when their torque and their angular resistance to acceleration reach equilibrium.\
      \ If the same amount of torque continues higher, it will increase max speed,\
      \ but only to a point. (The default bulldog does not reach the equlibrium.)\
      \ You might also consider than the first curve in the above will allow you to\
      \ get maximum torque at ANY wheel spin speed, you need to terminate it by having\
      \ the last value be 0 or whatever amount you wanted for the wheels to reach\
      \ the equilibrium point. I'll refactor this into the above someday.&#160;:P</p>\n\

      \ that one. We still have to make our MyBulldog class use those tires. <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:KCar\" title=\"Legacy:KCar\">KCar</a> has declared two variables for\
      \ us to use for specifying the tires of any such vehicle:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"\

      \ class=\"re0\">Class</span>&lt; SEMI &gt;</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Notice how\
      \ the Bulldog class sets these to BulldogTire in its own defaultproperties.\
      \ We will set them to our own tire class like this:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"\
      mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n\

      \ itself has a lot of polygons and so on, which is probably not needed in creating\
      \ a rather accurate yet blurry shadow. What he means is that when you want the\
      \ shadow, spawn another actor which has a similiar shape to the Bulldog but\
      \ a lot less polycounts and since that shape[aka 3D model] has less polys and\
      \ then generate the shadow from that mesh and it will be much quicker.</p>\n\

      <hr />\n<p><b>Chema:</b> A question: to add shadow to the bulldog, you have\

      \ I had several maps with spawned Bulldogs (but no factories)? I could edit\
      \ the map, but how could I add the shadow to the original Bulls, only with code?\

      <p><b>Chema:</b> But what would I do in the mutator? Redefine/obscure the bulldog\

      \ and a function called ReplaceWith. This allows you to replace all instances\
      \ of a given class with another class. It is used, for instance, in the Arena\
      \ mutator to change all of the weapons. Likewise you could use the mutator to\
      \ replace all instances of the Bulldog with your new, modified Bulldog. That\
      \ way no maps would need to be modified, and backwards compatibility would also\
      \ be retained if people wanted to play a map containing your modified bulldogs\
      \ but would rather use the default bulldogs. The mutator could look something\
      \ like the following, with \"NewBulldogClass\" replaced with whatever the class\
      \ name of your modified bulldog is. It might not compile or work quite right,\

      \ with the wheels to much. I've been trying to make smaller wheels by simply\
      \ scaling down the bulldog tires, but some odd things start happening. The collision\
      \ and staticmesh are scaled down, as it actually looks smaller and I can bounce\
      \ grenades around it accuratly. BUT, the wheel itself rest on the ground as\
      \ if it were still as big as normal, making it look like the wheel is floating\
      \ a bit off the ground. I'm assuming this is becuase the new scal isn't set\
      \ properly in the Karma and was wondering if anyone new where I could go in\
      \ the code to fix this?</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> I had some messings with vehicle\

      \ No I already did that. I'm not having a problem with the wheels location.\
      \ The problem is that even tho the graphic of the wheel is scaled down it still\
      \ rolls on the ground as if it were bigger. the strange part is that weapon\
      \ traces and projectiles collide properly!?</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Well, did\
      \ you make a new collision for the wheels? It doesn't need one&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Well, since it's a KTire, it's magic for Karma purposes. The\
      \ original bulldog tire has a Karma collision hull but also a traditional collisionradius\
      \ and collisionheight - maybe one of those is being used for the tire simulation.</p>\n\
      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> Are you sure that the KTire has a karma collision hull?\
      \ When you turn on that view karma collision button, it doesn't show an collision...</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Ah. That's because it has a \"Karma Primitive\" collision\
      \ but no polygonal collision. You can use both, but the tire has only one. The\
      \ \"Karma Primitive\" collision has to be specified in the modelling program,\
      \ but allows you to do perfect spherical collision and cylinder collision. You\
      \ can view these collision hulls by checking the \"Show Karma Primitives\" menu\
      \ item.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> I see&#160;:) It all becomes clear at last.</p>\n\
      <p><b>WinterHummer:</b> I like what you all the work for the bulldog but i'm\
      \ having trouble getting it to drive faster in UT2004. I've done the fix but\
      \ i've tried \"KMaxSpeed\" Nope</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> I don't really deal\
      \ with the workings of vehicles (I believe they should be EASIER to code), but\
      \ I think you're better off working with UT2004's version of the vehicle code.\
      \ It's more stable and works better. I also remember the last time I spawned\
      \ a bulldog in UT2004. It moved for around 2 seconds then it just died and nothing\
      \ could budge it.</p>\n<p><b>WinterHummer:</b> You're probably right about just\
      \ working with the ut2004 SVehicle Code but its missing something and that is\
      \ drivesplit. You know like front wheel driver or rear wheel drive.I got the\
      \ going faster to work but now I cant get the wheelspin above 100000 &amp; change.\

    text: "==Introduction==\n\nA lot of people will want to play around with the demo\
      \ vehicle that comes with [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]], the Bulldog. This page holds\
      \ information about how to change certain aspects of the Bulldog.\n\nThe Bulldog\
      \ in UT2004 is the same code, but due to the move of KVehicle from a subclass\
      \ of Pawn to a subclass of Vehicle, and with all the other changes that took\
      \ place for Vehicle support in UT2004, the Bulldog is broken.  To fix it, see\
      \ the UT2004 Fix section on the [[Legacy:Bulldog|Bulldog]] page.\n\n==Tutorials==\n\
      \n===Making the Bulldog drive faster===\n\nThis question was asked on the BU\
      \ coding forum and is interesting because it needs general insight on how acceleration\
      \ and speed are done on vehicles in general. To find out about this, an important\
      \ function to observe is the following function taken from the [[Legacy:KCar|KCar]]\
      \ class:\n\n<uscript>\n// Tell it your current throttle, and it will give you\
      \ an output torque\n// This is currently like an electric motor\nfunction float\
      \ Engine(float Throttle)\n{\n\tlocal float torque;\n    \n\ttorque = Abs(Throttle)\
      \ * Gear * InterpCurveEval(TorqueCurve, WheelSpinSpeed);\n\n\tGraphData(\"SpinSpeed\"\
      , WheelSpinSpeed);\n\tGraphData(\"Torque\", torque);\n\n\treturn -1 * torque;\n\
      }\n</uscript>\n\nIt calculates the torque of the wheels using Throttle (player\
      \ presses up or down), the gear (forwards or backwards) and the wheel spin speed\
      \ in combination with a torque curve. The calculated torque is in its turn applied\
      \ to the KMotorTorque property of the [[Legacy:KCarWheelJoint|KCarWheelJoint]]\
      \ associated with every tire ([[Legacy:KTire|KTire]].WheelJoint). So to increase\
      \ the maximum speed of the Bulldog or its acceleration, we only need to change\
      \ the TorqueCurve. This can be done in the [[Legacy:Default Properties|Default\
      \ Properties]] of a (user written) subclass by overriding the default value\
      \ in the Bulldog class.\n\nThe default value for TorqueCurve in the Bulldog\
      \ class is:\n\n<uscript>\nTorqueCurve=(Points=((InVal=0,OutVal=270),(InVal=200000,OutVal=270),(InVal=300000,OutVal=0)))\n\
      </uscript>\n\n:'''Note:''' If you are using UnrealEd you can't see the default\
      \ properties section of the class in it's source. Instead, you can right-click\
      \ the class in the class tree and choose 'Default Properties...'. The above\
      \ value will be under the KCar rollout.\n\nBasically this value of TorqueCurve\
      \ means the acceleration will be constant while wheel spin speed is between\
      \ 0 and 200000, and that it will linearly decrease between 200000 and 300000.\
      \ For RPM, these values will probably need to be divided by 65535 (see [[udn2:KarmaReference]]).\
      \ The InterpCurveEval function will probably work the three coordinates in a\
      \ curve so the actual \"wheel-spin -> torque\" relation will be a somewhat smoothed\
      \ out version.\n\nTo '''increase the maximum speed''' of the Bulldog, you can\
      \ simply make the torque last on higher wheel spin speeds by increasing the\
      \ last two InVal numbers.\n\nTo '''increase the acceleration''' of the Bulldog,\
      \ you can increase the value of the OutVal properties. This will not have a\
      \ very noticable effect though, because the wheels will slid very much. But\
      \ decreasing acceleration works very well.\n\nBe carefull though, the Bulldog\
      \ is not build on such high speeds. The front wheels will quickly lift from\
      \ the air and make steering impossible, and you'll run into some rock eventually\
      \ and fly miles away. Of course, the steering problem could in its turn be worked\
      \ around by deviding the weight of the Bulldog to have more mass in the front.\
      \ Something that could be covered in a tutorial on coding [[Legacy:Karma|Karma]]\
      \ objects I think.\n\n===Using the TorqueCurves for Gears===\n\n'''Kaoh:'''\
      \ I would like to add some info to the TorqueCurve info, first time so i hope\
      \ I do it correctly ;).\n\n'''Note''' To do this you need to subclass the Bulldog,\
      \ you cant do this when you place a bulldog or something.\n\nThe Curve can be\
      \ build with as much points as you want. All points consist of 2 pairs the InVal\
      \ and OutVal as shown above. The Outval is the acceleration the vehicle will\
      \ have, the Inval specify's the wheelspin range for what this OutVal is valid\
      \ for. Check the above examples for more info on this.\n\nThis means that the\
      \ acceleration will always be only attached to the wheelspin. With gears you\
      \ want to simulate the loss of acceleration when the car drives too slow for\
      \ that gear, this can't be done with one Curve.\n\nThink of this as Gears in\
      \ a car where you actually change the gear to get a better Curve for that speed.\n\
      \nThe best way to do that is to specify multiple gear ratios.\n\n<uscript>\n\
      TorqueCurve[1]=(Points=((InVal=0,OutVal=270),(InVal=200000,OutVal=270)))\nTorqueCurve[2]=(Points=((InVal=0,OutVal=2),(InVal=200000,OutVal=270),(InVal=300000,OutVal=0)))\n\
      </uscript>\n\nThis will make it so that in the first gear you can only go up\
      \ to 200000 wheelspin but with good acceleration. In the second gear you will\
      \ now accelerate really bad till you hit that 200000 wheelspin and then accelerate\
      \ good up to 300000.\n\nThis is rather simple to implement to a vehicle with\
      \ gears.\n\nYou can now simply change the code in the engine function to use\
      \ the correct Curve and add some code that switches gears.\n\n<uscript>\n//\
      \ Tell it your current throttle, and it will give you an output torque\n// This\
      \ is currently like an electric motor\nfunction float Engine(float Throttle)\n\
      {\n\tlocal float torque;\n    \n\ttorque = Abs(Throttle) * Gear * InterpCurveEval(TorqueCurve[Gear],\
      \ WheelSpinSpeed);\n\n\tGraphData(\"SpinSpeed\", WheelSpinSpeed);\n\tGraphData(\"\
      Torque\", torque);\n\n\treturn -1 * torque;\n}\n</uscript>\n\nAs you can see\
      \ I made of the TorqueCurve a Array so you can easely add more curves depending\
      \ on the amount of gears you want.\n\nThis way you can let a fith gear accelerate\
      \ almost to none but a first gear with good speed.\n\n'''Note''' The actual\
      \ speed of the vehicle is based primairly on the Torque that is genererated\
      \ on the wheels. The second major factor is the size of the wheels. When you\
      \ increase the size of the wheels and keep the torgue the same, you will drive\
      \ faster because very simply the rotation stays the same.\n\nI hope this helps\
      \ some people.\n\nThanks to Bjorn for giving this info in the first place, helped\
      \ me out a lot\n\n'''Birelli:''' If I'm reading the above code right, it needs\
      \ a slight tweak in that you can't both multiply by the current gear AND reference\
      \ the correct torque curve with it, unless your torque curves are all going\
      \ to take into account the fact that when you kick the bulldog into second gear\
      \ you're going to automatically double the torque. I think if you actually used\
      \ that code above it would be readily apparent that there was a problem with\
      \ it the first time you shifted gears and your acceleration suddenly doubled\
      \ ;).\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Actually the approximate speed of the vehicle is based\
      \ on the rate at which the wheels are turning multiplied by their radius, multiplied\
      \ by the \"coefficient of traction\" which is some mangled native version of\
      \ the friction of the wheels on the ground. Torque causes the wheels to accelerate.\
      \ They will cease accelerating when their torque and their angular resistance\
      \ to acceleration reach equilibrium. If the same amount of torque continues\
      \ higher, it will increase max speed, but only to a point. (The default bulldog\
      \ does not reach the equlibrium.) You might also consider than the first curve\
      \ in the above will allow you to get maximum torque at ANY wheel spin speed,\
      \ you need to terminate it by having the last value be 0 or whatever amount\
      \ you wanted for the wheels to reach the equilibrium point. I'll refactor this\
      \ into the above someday. :P\n\n===Adding Shadow to the Bulldog===\n\nIf you\
      \ have driven around with the Bulldog you must have noticed that it didn't have\
      \ any shadow. Adding shadow to the Bulldog would make blend much more realistically\
      \ into its environment. There's a reason for not having shadow on the Bulldog\
      \ though, it's because it is slow. It's even very slow when viewing the Bulldog\
      \ from very close (only tested on Radeon 8500, needs confirmation for other\
      \ cards). But slow or not, let's add it anyway.\n\n[[Legacy:Create A Subclass|Create\
      \ A Subclass]] of the Bulldog, eg \"MyBulldog\" in your own \"MyPackage\". Once\
      \ you've set that up, read on. In [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]], shadows are cast\
      \ by [[Legacy:ShadowProjector|ShadowProjector]]s. Our own Bulldog will need\
      \ a shadow projector associated with it so add this variable:\n\n<uscript>\n\
      var ShadowProjector BulldogShadow;\n</uscript>\n\nWe only have to make sure\
      \ that the shadow is spawned as soon as the Bulldog is spawned. This can be\
      \ done in the function PostBeginPlay(). The spawned shadow will also need to\
      \ be removed as soon as the Bulldog is removed. This can be done in the function\
      \ Destroyed(). Here's the code to add to you MyBulldog class:\n\n<uscript>\n\
      simulated function PostBeginPlay()\n{\n\tSuper.PostBeginPlay();\n\n\tif (Level.NetMode\
      \ != NM_DedicatedServer)\n\t{\n\t\tBulldogShadow = Spawn(class'ShadowProjector',\
      \ self, '', Location);\n\t\tBulldogShadow.ShadowActor = self;\n\t\tBulldogShadow.bBlobShadow\
      \ = false;\n\t\tBulldogShadow.LightDirection = Normal(vect(1,1,6));\n\t\tBulldogShadow.LightDistance\
      \ = 1200;\n\t\tBulldogShadow.MaxTraceDistance = 350;\n\t\tBulldogShadow.InitShadow();\n\
      \t}\n}\n\nsimulated function Destroyed()\n{\n\tif (BulldogShadow != None) BulldogShadow.Destroy();\n\
      \tSuper.Destroyed();\n}\n</uscript>\n\nNotice that we don't need to update the\
      \ shadow ourselves, the [[Legacy:ShadowProjector|ShadowProjector]] will take\
      \ care of that in its Tick() function. At this stage only the chassis of the\
      \ Bulldog will cast a shadow. Of course, this doesn't look quite right so we'll\
      \ need to add shadow to the tires too. I'll leave it to your own practice to\
      \ subclass BulldogTire with your own MyBulldogTire class and add shadow casting\
      \ to it.\n\nNow I assume you have created a MyBulldogTire class and added shadow\
      \ casting to that one. We still have to make our MyBulldog class use those tires.\
      \ [[Legacy:KCar|KCar]] has declared two variables for us to use for specifying\
      \ the tires of any such vehicle:\n\n<uscript>\nvar (KCar) class<KTire> FrontTireClass;\n\
      var (KCar) class<KTire> RearTireClass;\n</uscript>\n\nNotice how the Bulldog\
      \ class sets these to BulldogTire in its own defaultproperties. We will set\
      \ them to our own tire class like this:\n\n<uscript>\ndefaultproperties\n{\n\
      \tFrontTireClass=class'MyBulldogTire'\n\tRearTireClass=class'MyBulldogTire'\n\
      }\n</uscript>\n\nAnd we're done. Our Bulldog and its tires will now be casting\
      \ a nice shadow on the ground as well as on other static meshes like other Bulldogs.\
      \ Here's a screenshot showing off the effect:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_BulldogShadowOnCrop.jpeg|center|]]\n\

      \ a lot less polycounts and since that shape[aka 3D model] has less polys and\

      \ and force feedback code of the bullye.  Has anyone done it already?\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ I don't have any force feedback devices so I haven't tested that but the sounds\
      \ (at least the ones I played around with) work fine. There just isn't any sounds\
      \ set into the sound variables. All of the function calls, etc. are already\
      \ in place, you just need to add sounds in the defaultproperties.\n\n'''Billy\
      \ Boy:''' How would I go about making the Bulldog smaller? I want to half its\
      \ size for a smaller indoor arena.\n\n'''ProjectX (Finally decided to learn\
      \ coding yay!!!):''' Billy, all you do is change the static mesh scale in the\
      \ default properties. I suggest you start using an IDE such as conTEXT or UDE\
      \ to do your coding since UnrealEd won' let you do advanced stuff like custom\
      \ models.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Actually you can, it's just not very convenient.\
      \ I too would not recommend using UnrealEd to modify script though. I used to\
      \ just use notepad, but now I use [[Legacy:TextPad|TextPad]].\n\n'''Erdrik:'''\
      \ I've been messing around with vehicle code for awhile(submited a hovertank\
      \ code in the vehicles section), but I haven't really mess around with the wheels\
      \ to much. I've been trying to make smaller wheels by simply scaling down the\
      \ bulldog tires, but some odd things start happening. The collision and staticmesh\
      \ are scaled down, as it actually looks smaller and I can bounce grenades around\
      \ it accuratly. BUT, the wheel itself rest on the ground as if it were still\
      \ as big as normal, making it look like the wheel is floating a bit off the\
      \ ground. I'm assuming this is becuase the new scal isn't set properly in the\
      \ Karma and was wondering if anyone new where I could go in the code to fix\
      \ this?\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I had some messings with vehicle code too.  Most\
      \ of the stuff I did caused errors and locked my computer up.  Sigh...  Anyways,\
      \ to fix your wheel problem, I imagine that you haven't changed the position\
      \ of the wheels (relative to the vehicle of course :)) .  You'll have to experiment\
      \ with this until you get what your looking for but if you look in the default\
      \ properties and find a property called:\n\n<uscript>\n     WheelFrontAlong=-100.000000\n\
      \     WheelFrontAcross=110.000000\n     WheelRearAlong=115.000000\n     WheelRearAcross=110.000000\
      \ \n     WheelVert=-15.000000 // For vertical alignment I believe ;)\n</uscript>\n\
      \n'''Erdrik:''' No I already did that. I'm not having a problem with the wheels\
      \ location. The problem is that even tho the graphic of the wheel is scaled\
      \ down it still rolls on the ground as if it were bigger. the strange part is\
      \ that weapon traces and projectiles collide properly!?\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Well,\
      \ did you make a new collision for the wheels?  It doesn't need one :)\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ Well, since it's a KTire, it's magic for Karma purposes. The original bulldog\
      \ tire has a Karma collision hull but also a traditional collisionradius and\
      \ collisionheight - maybe one of those is being used for the tire simulation.\n\
      \n'''MythOpus:''' Are you sure that the KTire has a karma collision hull?  When\
      \ you turn on that view karma collision button, it doesn't show an collision...\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' Ah. That's because it has a \"Karma Primitive\" collision but\
      \ no polygonal collision. You can use both, but the tire has only one. The \"\
      Karma Primitive\" collision has to be specified in the modelling program, but\
      \ allows you to do perfect spherical collision and cylinder collision. You can\
      \ view these collision hulls by checking the \"Show Karma Primitives\" menu\
      \ item.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I see :)  It all becomes clear at last.\n\n'''WinterHummer:'''\
      \ I like what you all the work for the bulldog but i'm having trouble getting\
      \ it to drive faster in UT2004. I've done the fix but i've tried \"KMaxSpeed\"\
      \ Nope\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I don't really deal with the workings of vehicles\
      \ (I believe they should be EASIER to code), but I think you're better off working\
      \ with UT2004's version of the vehicle code.  It's more stable and works better.\
      \  I also remember the last time I spawned a bulldog in UT2004.  It moved for\
      \ around 2 seconds then it just died and nothing could budge it.  \n\n'''WinterHummer:'''\
      \ You're probably right about just working with the ut2004 SVehicle Code but\
      \ its missing something and that is drivesplit. You know like front wheel driver\
      \ or rear wheel drive.I got the going faster to work but now I cant get the\
      \ wheelspin above 100000 & change. Oh and changing the torecurve is having no\
      \ effect.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Tutorial|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
