      <p>I wasn't overly thrilled with the images, they were not quite what I had\

      \ all 3 on my hard drive.</p>\n<p>I opened them up in photoshop, and made a\

      \ black through white greyscale gradeint and made it radial, so that I had a\
      \ white dot in the center of a black background which was smoothly blending\
      \ between the grey scale.</p>\n<p>For the 3 images that I had made in texture\
      \ maker, I went to the <b>Channels</b> tab on the same floating toolbar, and\
      \ added an extra channel, I then copied the dot into this new channel for each\
      \ of them.</p>\n<p>I then made a 512x512 RGB image.</p>\n<p>I went back to the\
      \ images from texture maker, and with the 4th channel selected and visible (the\
      \ grey dot), I clicked the <b>Load Channel as Selection</b>, I then changed\
      \ back to the main RGB Channel, and copied, I went to the new, blank image that\
      \ I had just made (the RGB image), and pasted what I had copied into the red\
      \ channel, the 2nd texture from texture make I repeated the process, except\
      \ I copied it into the green channel, and the third Texture Maker image into\
      \ the blue channel.</p>\n<p>I could have kept going with the textures, but I\
      \ decided to change courses here and produce a static mesh to test them out\
      \ in game, there were reasons for this, and they were that I was not overly\
      \ happy with this result, I tend to muck around a lot when making things, and\
      \ you should be aware that changing tasks (and in my case moving around the\
      \ house between computers) slows things down, effeciency can be important to\
