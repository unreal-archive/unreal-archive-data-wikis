      <p>A demo should always be released before the game, in terms of marketing.\
      \ Games which have done so (UT series, Call of Duty, Half-Life, Medal of Honor,\
      \ and so many more) have also recieved a lot more attention than games releasing\
      \ the demo after the full game (Mafia, Hidden &amp; Dangerous 2, GTA3 PC versions,\
      \ Unreal 2 and more...). The demo quite clearly serves as a buildup in the hype,\
      \ and as such does more for the game than a gigantic commercial campaign.</p>\n\

      \ make sure the demo's .exe file isn't broken. I belive the Thief 3 demo is\
      \ the first demo which has a broken t3game.exe, as in, all I get is an error\
      \ message when I open it.</p>\n<p>When the demo is heavier than 400 mb this\

      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> No editor, no sale. I may never use it but I like to\
      \ know it is there just in case I feel the urge. The multiple release dates\
      \ is just indicative of Edios penny pinching I would guess. They've probably\
      \ gone for the cheapest publisher they can find in each country. Even though\
      \ I was looking forward to the game I still wouldn't warez it though. It's morally\
      \ indefensible.</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b> Eidos sucks. This reminds me of another game\
      \ they totally messed up. Deus Ex: Invisible War. I was cheated when I bought\
      \ that game.</p>\n<p>Hey heres a whole list of reasons DX:IW sucked.</p>\n<p>1.\
      \ It was only about 2 hours worth of gameplay</p>\n<p>2. Unified ammo</p>\n\
      <p>3. The AI sucked</p>\n<p>4. On \"Realistic\" mode it takes 3 shots to the\
      \ head with a pistol to kill someone</p>\n<p>5. They took out the skills system</p>\n\
      <p>6. It ran really really slow</p>\n<p>7. They made their own lighting system\
      \ that was really unoptimized</p>\n<p>8. They claim that the characters can\
      \ have different facial expressions, but all I can ever see is that all the\
      \ characters look like they're about to shit their pants.</p>\n<p>9. Boringly\
      \ predictable storyline.</p>\n<p>10. No editor</p>\n<p>11. Crashes like crazy</p>\n\
      <p>12. has a bug where it sometimes claims that my store-bought disc is a warez\
      \ copy</p>\n<p>13. Wierd screen flashes every time I move the mouse.</p>\n<p>14.\
      \ General stupidity (like when you're walking a certain direction and the compass\
      \ says \"north\" then you reach a loading point and it switches to \"south\"\
      )</p>\n<p>15. A lot of ingame books and datacubes mention \"Red Greasels\" and\
      \ the augmented baboons, both of which are enemies that never actually made\
      \ into the game.</p>\n<p>16. All the previews told us we could be able to kill\
      \ any important character to change the storyline, but most of the important\
      \ characters are behind magic bullet proof glass or in \"No weapon zones\" where\
      \ your weapons don't work and if you do manage to trick the engine into letting\
      \ your weapons work via a bug I found, you can't harm them, they just go oof\
      \ and not take damage.</p>\n<p>17. A whole bunch of other reasons I'll remember\
      \ later.</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> Exactly! They are doing the same thing again,\
      \ at least as far as marketing is concerned. I'm now downloading the game, as\
      \ there's no demo working. If it's good I'll buy it, I've already got an order\
      \ for it. If it's bad I'll simply cancel the order.</p>\n<p><b>TurkeyFromHell</b>:\

      <p>Right, I got the warez version and after a few hours of trying I still couldn't\
      \ run the game. I went to check the official site for information about what\
      \ might be causing the error, and found nothing at all. I couldn't even find\
      \ the system requirements! I did manage to find the message boards, however.</p>\n\
      <p>A sticky thread named requirements, finally! I checked it out and found that\
      \ Eidos had yet again found a way to be lamer than any other company in the\
      \ business.</p>\n<p>\"Windows NT/2000/XP supported\"</p>\n<p>I'm happy I didn't\
      \ pay for this bullshit. As there was no mention of the OS required where I\
      \ ordered the game I never thought of it. Also, only some special graphic cards\
      \ are supported, with big gaps in the line. For all what I care, <b>Eidos can\
      \ go fuck themselves</b>. I'm soon upgrading anyway, but I'm sure as hell not\
      \ paying for Thief 3 when I actually run it. Eidos doesn't deserve the dirt\
      \ under my shoes.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I'm somewhat surprised that you'd be\
      \ surprised to have difficulty running a warez version. Most warezed versions\
      \ of games (to my knowledge) are somewhat sketchy as to how well they work.</p>\n\
      <p>Also I don't quite understand the bit about NT/2000/XP. Why is that lame?\
      \ If it's because they aren't supporting older operating systems, you may be\
      \ writing a similar page about Epic soon. Word on UnrealEngine 3 is that they're\
      \ ditching support for older systems, and it will only operate on a 64 bit system\
      \ with a 256MB video card minimum. I have to agree to an extent with dropping\
      \ legacy support in some ways. Legacy support can really cause performance to\
      \ suffer - you should see half the crap they put in computer hardware these\
      \ days in a desparate bid to make old concepts \"less bad.\" The insanity!</p>\n\
      <p>But I digress. I don't think it's fair to come down on a company for discarding\
      \ legacy support. XP has been around for a while. It is itself going to be replaced\
      \ soon-ish by Windows Longhorn. Discarding legacy support makes code faster,\
      \ more readable, less buggy, and it can be produced more quickly too - there\
      \ are less \"special cases\" to deal with. Also legacy support sometimes requires\
      \ that you keep old architechtures which are severely outdated. *cough cough*\
      \ layered architecture *cough*</p>\n<p>Of course, I could be totally off base\
      \ and maybe your comment referred to something else. Regardless, I maintain\
      \ that warezed software rarely works properly, if at all. I've had my own experiences\
      \ with warezed software trying to find stuff that seems to have vanished off\
      \ the face of the Earth and software stores can't even find it in their databases.\
      \ (like Pax Imperia 2)</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> The warez version of games nowadays\
      \ are working perfectly in single player modes, for good and for bad. This would\
      \ have worked perfectly, and I'm glad I tried it as it was the only way to verify\
      \ it wasn't just the demo that was crap. It was the whole game.</p>\n<p>I know\
      \ that the Unreal 3 engine might be purely 64 bit. I'm almost sure of it, even.\
      \ I don't mind this at all, I hope it'll happen as soon as possible, maybe I\
      \ wont have to upgrade my 32 bit system.</p>\n<p>However, I do not find it acceptable\
      \ to see a game based on the Unreal engine forcing people into buying a new\
      \ OS. There's absolutely no chance for me to pay for both the new OS and the\
      \ game, just to play the game. Considering how only about 60% of the GFX cards\
      \ (Geforce 3 and later) are supported makes things worse. Did they actually\
      \ plan on <i>selling</i> this game?</p>\n<p>Judging by their forum the game\
      \ was tested by a bunch of 14-year olds, or nobody cared to listen to the testers\
      \ having trouble. Instead of fixing what was wrong they must have put the hardware\
      \ on the \"Cards not supported\"-list.</p>\n<p>I see no reason to think of ION\
      \ Storm nor Eidos as serious, considering how serious their latest releases\
      \ have been.</p>\n<p>I do not doubt it's a good game. But I do doubt cutting\
      \ half the community off wasn't needed to make it so good.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ Hmm. I had forgotten that it was Unreal Engine. In that case I'm curious why\
      \ they have such poor support for a variety of systems. Unless, like with Deus\
      \ Ex 2, they made their own renderer.</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> Yes, the entire\
      \ lighting system is said to be amazing, unlike the basic engine... I still\
      \ can't imagine this excuses the behaviour of Eidos and ION Storm. In a year\
      \ I would consider it ok, but this is far too early. I have more confidence\
      \ in mod teams than in the developers of Thief 3 after all this... If this is\
      \ what will happen to Windows games, I might as well go to Linux straight away.\
      \ I've had no bad experience with it so far apart from games and other applications\
      \ being impossible to run.</p>\n<p>Seing how almost all developers are now cutting\
      \ half it's customer base off, I can't see how they'll keep this up. But if\
      \ it's the way things will be in the next few years I might as well stick to\
      \ something stable and free, despite that I can't run what I want on it. It's\
      \ no difference any more.</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b> Argh EDIT CONLICT. ok fixing now.\
      \ The lighting system was still over hyped.</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b> They used the\
      \ renderer from DX2. That horribly inefficient one I was talking about. BTW\
      \ Harvey Smith left Ion storm and there have been claims by some that Warren\
      \ Spector did too, but Eidos denies the last part. Not what's really happening\
      \ at Ion Storm Austin. I heard Harvey Smith will form his own company. Eidos\
      \ owns most of Ion Storm anyway. The earlier Theif games and DX were before\
      \ Daikatana (which caused Eidos to close down Ion Storm Dallas and buy about\
      \ half of Ion Storm Austin.). Ion Storm should've sticked with the standard\
      \ renderer and maybe Karma instead of Havok. I think what happened was that\
      \ Eidos was pushing for Ion to release DX2 too early, it was obviously rushed\
      \ so it could be released before christmas. No support for Win98? How is that\
      \ possible?!?!?! It's the same engine as DX2, and that ran on my PC... Of course\
      \ I had it on the lowest detail level and the bloom lighting doesnt work, I\
      \ had to turn it off. They've had 2 patches and neither of them fix any of the\
      \ bugs I actually care about. And the first \"patch\" was simply a few tweaks\
      \ to the ini files. They should've included those *with* the game.</p>\n<p>continuing\
      \ the list about why I hate DX2:</p>\n<p>17. How has weapon technology gone\
      \ backwards where I can no longer have a grenade that if you get close to a\
      \ wall I can attach to the wall to *also* work as a proximity mine???? (I killed\
      \ my self this way, thinking it could attach to the wall.)</p>\n<p>18. How is\
      \ a little robot dog with a shotgun supposed to make me more intimidated then\
      \ the hulking military bots from DX1?</p>\n<p>19. The main character just looks\
      \ retarded and sounds like 12-year-old (BOTH with the male *AND* female choises.)</p>\n\
      <p>20. Boring anticlimatic endings. All 4 were horrid. (they promised us 5,\
      \ but the 5th was really just a retarded little \"dance party secret ending\"\
      .)</p>\n<p>21. Havok ragdolls constantly get their arms and legs stuck in ceilings\
      \ and floors.</p>\n<p>22. How did Havok make the game enjoyable? it didnt. Honestly\
      \ I prefered DX1's physics. True, it may not have been realistic in some ways,\
      \ but I'm pretty sure that in real life if you drop a fire extinguiser on someone's\
      \ head from a story up they'll be hurt. This was true in DX but not in DX2.</p>\n\
      <p>23. It has a bug where it sometimes claims that my DX2 cd is a warez copy\
      \ when I legally wasted my money on it.</p>\n<p>24. I have to pray at every\
      \ single loading screen for it not to say \"could not authenticate original\
      \ disc in time\" (Yah, they check if you have a warez disc at *every* loading\
      \ screen, now what's the point of that????)</p>\n<p>25. Loading takes forever.</p>\n\
      <p>26. It takes AI about 4 seconds to notice they've been shot, at which point,\
      \ they're probobly already dead.</p>\n<p>27. Unified ammo sucks. I run out of\
      \ ammo for my pistol. Ok lets switch to the shotgun. Wait. That's out of ammo\
      \ TOO. I have no melee weapons. I'm surrounded by enemy troops. And to make\
      \ it worse, they're placed in a position where the only way I can possibly sneak\
      \ by them is by using a cloaking augmentation, which I don't have....</p>\n\
      <p>28. Small levels. Smaller than the distance between each loading point in\
      \ Half-Life.</p>\n<p>29. Why did they change all references to \"nanotechnological\
      \ augmentation\" (augs) to \"biomodification\" (biomods)??</p>\n<p>30. Why did\
      \ they change the cool blue color of all the augmentation cannisters to that\
      \ ugly purple???</p>\n<p>31. How can an electronic device called a \"multitool\"\
      \ lockpick a door by shooting some kind of yellow lightning at it???? (in DX1\
      \ the multitool was used to hack electronic devices, and there was a separate\
      \ lockpick for non-electronic locks.)</p>\n<p>32. The music sucked and was extremely\
      \ repetitive.</p>\n<p>33. I'll think of more reasons later.</p>\n<p>hmmmm...\
      \ maybe I should make this into a rant of my own?</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ In terms of ditching old technology - it's simply a judgement call based on\
      \ (presumably) the number of people that are likely to buy the game having the\
      \ technology to run it. Not supporting an older OS or graphics card is good\
      \ sense if you are paying for the support and development of the product. It\
      \ not only removes a considerable support overhead as well, but also saves on\
      \ the development/test/QA sections of the development. You have the right to\
      \ be irritated about it (I don't care I have the appropriate OS/Hardware) -\
      \ but at some point supporting old hardware becomes nonsensical. Admittedly\
      \ they are dropping a chunk of the market but half of it? One would guess not.\
      \ I hate them more for fouling up what could have been a great game. I played\
      \ the demo and it put me off almost instantly (to the point where I never even\
      \ bothered finishing the demo).</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I wholeheartedly agree\
      \ with your comment about physics systems. I thought they were cool at first,\
      \ but they're slow, glitchy, and don't really add anything to the gameplay.\
      \ It's purely an eye-candy thing, but I think the cycles to it could be better\
      \ devoted to other eye-candy tasks. And, the amount of eye-candy added is minimal\
      \ - compare a ragdoll death in UT2003 (not sure if skeletal animation deaths\
      \ were included in UT2004) to the skeletal animation version - they are very\
      \ similar, but the skeletal animation one is a bit more believable because physics\
      \ system ragdolls pretty much always look like wire-fighting from cheesy kung\
      \ fu movies.</p>\n<p><b>BobClown:</b> I agree with Legal, the warez \"market\"\
      \ is working well, these days... if, of course, you know where to look. &#160;:)\
      \ As far as support for \"outdated\" operating systems goes, support for Windows\
      \ 98/ME ends June 30, 2006 (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"\
      http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh\">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh</a>;[LN];LifeAn1),\
      \ and I would hope that developers would choose to stick with that. Granted,\
      \ there are some odds and ends when porting between operating systems, but,\
      \ for the most part, windows code is pretty portable with itself, especially\
      \ when using directx api. Though I think the original rant was about how the\
      \ website (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.dxinvisiblewar.com/\"\
      >http://www.dxinvisiblewar.com/</a>) doesn't show system requirements.</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte:</b> The windows quircks are the issue, not directx. Microsoft\
      \ often changes little things that have a major impact on the program. This\
      \ requires you to include an additional OS in the whole testing cycle. That\
      \ adding an extra OS is a lot of work. When looking for what OS to support you\
      \ just have to take a look at OS people would use that have the minimum system\
      \ requirements (hardare only). For example it's impossible to use Win95 or Win98fe\
      \ when you have an AMD Athlon. And using Win98se or WinME with a newer CPU,\
      \ like Pentium 4 or Athlon XP\\Athlon 64, is just simply a waste of resources.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Legal:</b> When I bought this computer three years ago it came with Windows\
      \ ME. It's got a Pentium 4 processor anyway, as Win XP wasn't even available\
      \ yet. I haven't reinstalled Windows once, and I wont do so just because developers\
      \ wont make their games work with my OS. If they don't want my moneyt, fine,\
      \ I'll just warez it once I finally do have to upgrade. At least I hope I wont\
      \ have to upgrade before the current games are off the market.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't\
      \ be surprised if Epic and other developers are in fact getting their software\
      \ for free as long as they neglect support for older OS's. Let's face it, make\
      \ something only work with the latest OS makes people more likely to upgrade.\
      \ Judging by the official XP map pack and latest patch which destroys UED, Epic\
      \ has since Unreal grown less and less interested in widening their community,\
      \ but rather making people stick to their specs so they wont have to do such\
      \ horrible things as testing their stuff on more than three machines.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Dragonmaw:</b> I've only played Deus Ex 2's demo, but I can already tell\
      \ you I hate it. It's too linear for my tastes. In the orginal you could go\
      \ wandering around the city. In the new one, it tells you exactly where to go\
      \ and when to go. It takes the exploration fun out of the game.</p>\n<p>I've\
      \ also played Thief 3 on the Xbox, and it purrs. It not only purrs, it's one\
      \ of the best games I have played in a long, long time. The control scheme was\
      \ nice, the AI was adequate, nothing like Far Cry, but the gameplay was immersive\
      \ and expansive. My kind of game.</p>\n<p>I don't know about the PC version\
      \ though.</p>\n<p><b>Genetik:</b> I see no reason to hate developers over not\
      \ supporting Win98. Recently on BuF someone was having difficulties with UT2004,\
      \ and the screenie they provided showed they were running Win98. They were heartily\
      \ laughed at. <i>Of course</i>. It's 6-year-old software, and there's no reason\
      \ anyone should continue to be bothered by it's flaws/lack of functionality\
      \ anymore. Same goes for Me, which was certainly the buggiest and most annoying\
      \ peice of crap that ever wasted HD space, even for it's release date. I'm not\
      \ (I reapeat NOT) going to delay release of any software of mine because it\
      \ doesn't support Win 3.1, 98, or any other outdated OS.</p>\n<p><b>Mosquito:</b>\
      \ Windows 2000 and XP are so vastly superior to 98/ME its foolish to continue\
      \ to support them. Unless you want a legacy machine, theres no excuse for using\
      \ them.</p>\n<p><b>dataangel</b>: The OS ranting is, frankly, stupid. Nobody\
      \ supports Windows95 anymore. Lo and behold, that's starting to happen to Windows98.\
      \ You make it sound like Eidos/Ion is committing some unheard of attrocity.\
      \ WinME is pretty much just 98 with DOS stripped off. It endured a very short\
      \ life – it's market share is 'tiny'. If I was publishing a game I'd do the\
      \ same – I don't want tons of support calls from 98 users running unstable systems.\
      \ The card ranting is stupid too. Geforce3+ cards are the only ones supported\
      \ because they're the only ones PHYSICALLY capable of handling the rendering\
      \ – even if they coded the most efficient shadowing system in the world, Geforce2\
      \ era cards simply don't have the necessary instructions to support real time\
      \ shadows. The only workaround is an emulator, which would be horribly slow\
      \ no matter how you worked it. Yes, Eidos/Ion screwed up tons with DX2 and Thief3,\
      \ but here they did not, and because of your disappointment you're just looking\
      \ to point out any fault you can, even if it means making them up. That or you're\
      \ ignorant of the differences between modern Windows OSs and video cards and\
      \ those of the past.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Saying things are stupid, is stupididy\
      \ itself.:P</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> Most of the original rant of mine was actually\
      \ what I thought before I ordered the game. Lack of motivation and a huge amount\
      \ of homework made me ignore it the time. When I found out that the demo wasn't\
      \ working I began actually writing it all down, of course with the utter lazyness\
      \ of the Thief 3 developers to even test the game. Statements by people working\
      \ there saying \"it might work on some laptops, but we didn't think about testing\
      \ them\" and basing assumptions on wether it'll run or not on speculation isn't\
      \ what I'd call professional. They have a budget, they actually get payed, hence\
      \ they should make sure to test it on all the basic configurations of systems\
      \ users may try to run it on.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, things such as not marketing\
      \ it better than any 12-year old could and listing cards that can't be used\
      \ on the <b>forums</b> and not the <b>site</b> gives me the impression of ION\
      \ Storm and Eidos not giving a shit wheter I buy it or not. Which, as anyone\
      \ might guess, is what the title of this page is based on.</p>\n<p>To release\
      \ games such as Doom 3, Thief 3, and other new similar at a time where a large\
      \ part of the market is using Geforce 4 MX cards, Windows 98SE/ME and the other\
      \ things in the great list of what you can't do, I find the very idea of not\
      \ creating fallback systems ignorant. It's quite obvious that people will be\
      \ more likely to pirate a single player game without any multiplayer support\
      \ or editor than building their own Geforce FX.</p>\n<p>I really find your fanboy\
      \ approach to my rant interesting, not to say amusing. Did you even read the\
      \ arguments at the top? All of what's listed are the very most basic demands\
      \ from the public and companies who care about selling their game. Again, the\
      \ basic rant (that's all of what's above the \"Comments\" section) is completely\
      \ related to the title and reason for this page.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, instead of\
      \ going berzerk on what I think, you could write up a long list of the things\
      \ that were made right? I have no doubt it's a great game, but I find the reasoning\
      \ of developers nowadays to be that of a large corporation we call \"Microsoft\"\
      . \"Buy the hard/software we use or it's your own fault you can't play our games\"\
      .</p>\n<p>As many things Epic has done wrong with the Unreal 2 Engine, they\
      \ <b>did do</b> one thing right, where other companies fail. They created a\
      \ high profile graphics engine first, then added one or sometimes even <b>two\
      \ or three</b> levels of fallbacks. This gave them the market of both Linux,\
      \ Mac and those who still finds UT1 fun enough not to upgrade.</p>\n\n<!-- \n\

  wikitext:
    text: "Eidos have just set the example (again). I belive they managed to do everything\
      \ wrong, at least as far as I'm concerned, when selling Thief 3: Deadly Shadows.\n\
      \n===Release dates ===\n\nThis is a shameful behaviour which lack all reason.\
      \ When the game went gold a month before the US release date there's absolutely\
      \ no reason to release it yet '''another''' month later in Europe. I can't see\
      \ this as anything anyone could defend. Shame on thee, Eidos!\n\n===Release\
      \ dates 2 ===\n\nTo have more than two weeks between release dates across the\
      \ world is undefendable and has been since the late 1950's. Especially so when\
      \ the original release date was a month later than the date for gold status.\
      \ To have 10 different release dates for Europe wasn't very intellegent either.\n\
      \n===Demo ===\n\nA demo should always be released before the game, in terms\
      \ of marketing. Games which have done so (UT series, Call of Duty, Half-Life,\
      \ Medal of Honor, and so many more) have also recieved a lot more attention\
      \ than games releasing the demo after the full game (Mafia, Hidden & Dangerous\
      \ 2, GTA3 PC versions, Unreal 2 and more...). The demo quite clearly serves\
      \ as a buildup in the hype, and as such does more for the game than a gigantic\
      \ commercial campaign.\n\n===Demo 2 ===\n\nThe demo doesn't have to be perfect,\
      \ a few bugs wont be noticed in the little time you play the demo. However,\
      \ it's important to make sure the demo's .exe file isn't broken. I belive the\
      \ Thief 3 demo is the first demo which has a broken t3game.exe, as in, all I\
      \ get is an error message when I open it.\n\nWhen the demo is heavier than 400\
      \ mb this is worse than anything.\n\n===Editor ===\n\nI doubt anyone could claim\
      \ releasing an editor decreases sales. Especially when an editor is available\
      \ for the basic game engine (Unreal Engine 2), this is odd. Bad move there.\n\
      \n===Marketing ===\n\nThree Flash-ads isn't enough to sell a game.\n\n===Conclusion\
      \ ===\n\nI see absolutely no reason to buy this game. The demo doesn't work,\
      \ the release date is horribly planned, there's no editor and I've seen virtually\
      \ no real marketing done, aside from three different Flash-ads on a few sites.\
      \ I have absolutely no idea of what the game contains or if it's good, aside\
      \ from some few reviews and the two earlier Thief games.\n\nThere's no reason\
      \ to pay other than moral values and wanting to see Thief 4, however, even these\
      \ reasons are somewhat uncertain. Eidos has clearly proved this game's not interesting\
      \ and I wont be happy to see Thief 4 being sold in the same horrible way Thief\
      \ 3 is being sold. I think I'll go warez it now and if I like it and can be\
      \ bothered to buy a legal copy, I might just pay for it.\n\n===Comments ===\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' No editor, no sale.  I may never use it but I like to know\
      \ it is there just in case I feel the urge.  The multiple release dates is just\
      \ indicative of Edios penny pinching I would guess.  They've probably gone for\
      \ the cheapest publisher they can find in each country.  Even though I was looking\
      \ forward to the game I still wouldn't warez it though.  It's morally indefensible.\n\
      \n'''T1:''' Eidos sucks. This reminds me of another game they totally messed\
      \ up. Deus Ex: Invisible War. I was cheated when I bought that game.\n\nHey\
      \ heres a whole list of reasons DX:IW sucked.\n\n1. It was only about 2 hours\
      \ worth of gameplay\n\n2. Unified ammo\n\n3. The AI sucked\n\n4. On \"Realistic\"\
      \ mode it takes 3 shots to the head with a pistol to kill someone\n\n5. They\
      \ took out the skills system\n\n6. It ran really really slow\n\n7. They made\
      \ their own lighting system that was really unoptimized\n\n8. They claim that\
      \ the characters can have different facial expressions, but all I can ever see\
      \ is that all the characters look like they're about to shit their pants.\n\n\
      9. Boringly predictable storyline.\n\n10. No editor\n\n11. Crashes like crazy\n\
      \n12. has a bug where it sometimes claims that my store-bought disc is a warez\
      \ copy\n\n13. Wierd screen flashes every time I move the mouse.\n\n14. General\
      \ stupidity (like when you're walking a certain direction and the compass says\
      \ \"north\" then you reach a loading point and it switches to \"south\")\n\n\
      15. A lot of ingame books and datacubes mention \"Red Greasels\" and the augmented\
      \ baboons, both of which are enemies that never actually made into the game.\n\
      \n16. All the previews told us we could be able to kill any important character\
      \ to change the storyline, but most of the important characters are behind magic\
      \ bullet proof glass or in \"No weapon zones\" where your weapons don't work\
      \ and if you do manage to trick the engine into letting your weapons work via\
      \ a bug I found, you can't harm them, they just go oof and not take damage.\n\
      \n17. A whole bunch of other reasons I'll remember later.\n\n'''Legal:''' Exactly!\
      \ They are doing the same thing again, at least as far as marketing is concerned.\
      \ I'm now downloading the game, as there's no demo working. If it's good I'll\
      \ buy it, I've already got an order for it. If it's bad I'll simply cancel the\
      \ order.\n\n'''TurkeyFromHell''': Best. Game. Ever.\n\n==Update ==\n\nRight,\
      \ I got the warez version and after a few hours of trying I still couldn't run\
      \ the game. I went to check the official site for information about what might\
      \ be causing the error, and found nothing at all. I couldn't even find the system\
      \ requirements! I did manage to find the message boards, however.\n\nA sticky\
      \ thread named requirements, finally! I checked it out and found that Eidos\
      \ had yet again found a way to be lamer than any other company in the business.\n\
      \n\"Windows NT/2000/XP supported\"\n\nI'm happy I didn't pay for this bullshit.\
      \ As there was no mention of the OS required where I ordered the game I never\
      \ thought of it. Also, only some special graphic cards are supported, with big\
      \ gaps in the line. For all what I care, '''Eidos can go fuck themselves'''.\
      \ I'm soon upgrading anyway, but I'm sure as hell not paying for Thief 3 when\
      \ I actually run it. Eidos doesn't deserve the dirt under my shoes.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ I'm somewhat surprised that you'd be surprised to have difficulty running\
      \ a warez version. Most warezed versions of games (to my knowledge) are somewhat\
      \ sketchy as to how well they work.\n\nAlso I don't quite understand the bit\
      \ about NT/2000/XP. Why is that lame? If it's because they aren't supporting\
      \ older operating systems, you may be writing a similar page about Epic soon.\
      \ Word on UnrealEngine 3 is that they're ditching support for older systems,\
      \ and it will only operate on a 64 bit system with a 256MB video card minimum.\
      \ I have to agree to an extent with dropping legacy support in some ways. Legacy\
      \ support can really cause performance to suffer - you should see half the crap\
      \ they put in computer hardware these days in a desparate bid to make old concepts\
      \ \"less bad.\" The insanity!\n\nBut I digress. I don't think it's fair to come\
      \ down on a company for discarding legacy support. XP has been around for a\
      \ while. It is itself going to be replaced soon-ish by Windows Longhorn. Discarding\
      \ legacy support makes code faster, more readable, less buggy, and it can be\
      \ produced more quickly too - there are less \"special cases\" to deal with.\
      \ Also legacy support sometimes requires that you keep old architechtures which\
      \ are severely outdated. *cough cough* layered architecture *cough*\n\nOf course,\
      \ I could be totally off base and maybe your comment referred to something else.\
      \ Regardless, I maintain that warezed software rarely works properly, if at\
      \ all. I've had my own experiences with warezed software trying to find stuff\
      \ that seems to have vanished off the face of the Earth and software stores\
      \ can't even find it in their databases. (like Pax Imperia 2)\n\n'''Legal:'''\
      \ The warez version of games nowadays are working perfectly in single player\
      \ modes, for good and for bad. This would have worked perfectly, and I'm glad\
      \ I tried it as it was the only way to verify it wasn't just the demo that was\
      \ crap. It was the whole game.\n\nI know that the Unreal 3 engine might be purely\
      \ 64 bit. I'm almost sure of it, even. I don't mind this at all, I hope it'll\
      \ happen as soon as possible, maybe I wont have to upgrade my 32 bit system.\n\
      \nHowever, I do not find it acceptable to see a game based on the Unreal engine\
      \ forcing people into buying a new OS. There's absolutely no chance for me to\
      \ pay for both the new OS and the game, just to play the game. Considering how\
      \ only about 60% of the GFX cards (Geforce 3 and later) are supported makes\
      \ things worse. Did they actually plan on ''selling'' this game?\n\nJudging\
      \ by their forum the game was tested by a bunch of 14-year olds, or nobody cared\
      \ to listen to the testers having trouble. Instead of fixing what was wrong\
      \ they must have put the hardware on the \"Cards not supported\"-list.\n\nI\
      \ see no reason to think of ION Storm nor Eidos as serious, considering how\
      \ serious their latest releases have been.\n\nI do not doubt it's a good game.\
      \ But I do doubt cutting half the community off wasn't needed to make it so\
      \ good.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Hmm. I had forgotten that it was Unreal Engine. In\
      \ that case I'm curious why they have such poor support for a variety of systems.\
      \ Unless, like with Deus Ex 2, they made their own renderer.\n\n'''Legal:'''\
      \ Yes, the entire lighting system is said to be amazing, unlike the basic engine...\
      \ I still can't imagine this excuses the behaviour of Eidos and ION Storm. In\
      \ a year I would consider it ok, but this is far too early. I have more confidence\
      \ in mod teams than in the developers of Thief 3 after all this... If this is\
      \ what will happen to Windows games, I might as well go to Linux straight away.\
      \ I've had no bad experience with it so far apart from games and other applications\
      \ being impossible to run.\n\nSeing how almost all developers are now cutting\
      \ half it's customer base off, I can't see how they'll keep this up. But if\
      \ it's the way things will be in the next few years I might as well stick to\
      \ something stable and free, despite that I can't run what I want on it. It's\
      \ no difference any more.\n\n'''T1:''' Argh EDIT CONLICT. ok fixing now. The\
      \ lighting system was still over hyped.\n\n'''T1:''' They used the renderer\
      \ from DX2. That horribly inefficient one I was talking about. BTW Harvey Smith\
      \ left Ion storm and there have been claims by some that Warren Spector did\
      \ too, but Eidos denies the last part. Not what's really happening at Ion Storm\
      \ Austin. I heard Harvey Smith will form his own company. Eidos owns most of\
      \ Ion Storm anyway. The earlier Theif games and DX were before Daikatana (which\
      \ caused Eidos to close down Ion Storm Dallas and buy about half of Ion Storm\
      \ Austin.). Ion Storm should've sticked with the standard renderer and maybe\
      \ Karma instead of Havok. I think what happened was that Eidos was pushing for\
      \ Ion to release DX2 too early, it was obviously rushed so it could be released\
      \ before christmas. No support for Win98? How is that possible?!?!?! It's the\
      \ same engine as DX2, and that ran on my PC... Of course I had it on the lowest\
      \ detail level and the bloom lighting doesnt work, I had to turn it off. They've\
      \ had 2 patches and neither of them fix any of the bugs I actually care about.\
      \ And the first \"patch\" was simply a few tweaks to the ini files. They should've\
      \ included those *with* the game.\n\ncontinuing the list about why I hate DX2:\n\
      \n17. How has weapon technology gone backwards where I can no longer have a\
      \ grenade that if you get close to a wall I can attach to the wall to *also*\
      \ work as a proximity mine???? (I killed my self this way, thinking it could\
      \ attach to the wall.)\n\n18. How is a little robot dog with a shotgun supposed\
      \ to make me more intimidated then the hulking military bots from DX1?\n\n19.\
      \ The main character just looks retarded and sounds like 12-year-old (BOTH with\
      \ the male *AND* female choises.)\n\n20. Boring anticlimatic endings. All 4\
      \ were horrid. (they promised us 5, but the 5th was really just a retarded little\
      \ \"dance party secret ending\".)\n\n21. Havok ragdolls constantly get their\
      \ arms and legs stuck in ceilings and floors.\n\n22. How did Havok make the\
      \ game enjoyable? it didnt. Honestly I prefered DX1's physics. True, it may\
      \ not have been realistic in some ways, but I'm pretty sure that in real life\
      \ if you drop a fire extinguiser on someone's head from a story up they'll be\
      \ hurt. This was true in DX but not in DX2.\n\n23. It has a bug where it sometimes\
      \ claims that my DX2 cd is a warez copy when I legally wasted my money on it.\n\
      \n24. I have to pray at every single loading screen for it not to say \"could\
      \ not authenticate original disc in time\" (Yah, they check if you have a warez\
      \ disc at *every* loading screen, now what's the point of that????)\n\n25. Loading\
      \ takes forever.\n\n26. It takes AI about 4 seconds to notice they've been shot,\
      \ at which point, they're probobly already dead.\n\n27. Unified ammo sucks.\
      \ I run out of ammo for my pistol. Ok lets switch to the shotgun. Wait. That's\
      \ out of ammo TOO. I have no melee weapons. I'm surrounded by enemy troops.\
      \ And to make it worse, they're placed in a position where the only way I can\
      \ possibly sneak by them is by using a cloaking augmentation, which I don't\
      \ have....\n\n28. Small levels. Smaller than the distance between each loading\
      \ point in Half-Life.\n\n29. Why did they change all references to \"nanotechnological\
      \ augmentation\" (augs) to \"biomodification\" (biomods)??\n\n30. Why did they\
      \ change the cool blue color of all the augmentation cannisters to that ugly\
      \ purple???\n\n31. How can an electronic device called a \"multitool\" lockpick\
      \ a door by shooting some kind of yellow lightning at it???? (in DX1 the multitool\
      \ was used to hack electronic devices, and there was a separate lockpick for\
      \ non-electronic locks.)\n\n32. The music sucked and was extremely repetitive.\n\
      \n33. I'll think of more reasons later.\n\nhmmmm... maybe I should make this\
      \ into a rant of my own?\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' In terms of ditching old technology\
      \ - it's simply a judgement call based on (presumably) the number of people\
      \ that are likely to buy the game having the technology to run it.  Not supporting\
      \ an older OS or graphics card is good sense if you are paying for the support\
      \ and development of the product.  It not only removes a considerable support\
      \ overhead as well, but also saves on the development/test/QA sections of the\
      \ development.  You have the right to be irritated about it (I don't care I\
      \ have the appropriate OS/Hardware) - but at some point supporting old hardware\
      \ becomes nonsensical.  Admittedly they are dropping a chunk of the market but\
      \ half of it?  One would guess not.  I hate them more for fouling up what could\
      \ have been a great game.  I played the demo and it put me off almost instantly\
      \ (to the point where I never even bothered finishing the demo).\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ I wholeheartedly agree with your comment about physics systems. I thought\
      \ they were cool at first, but they're slow, glitchy, and don't really add anything\
      \ to the gameplay. It's purely an eye-candy thing, but I think the cycles to\
      \ it could be better devoted to other eye-candy tasks. And, the amount of eye-candy\
      \ added is minimal - compare a ragdoll death in UT2003 (not sure if skeletal\
      \ animation deaths were included in UT2004) to the skeletal animation version\
      \ - they are very similar, but the skeletal animation one is a bit more believable\
      \ because physics system ragdolls pretty much always look like wire-fighting\
      \ from cheesy kung fu movies.\n\n'''BobClown:''' I agree with Legal, the warez\
      \ \"market\" is working well, these days...  if, of course, you know where to\
      \ look.  :)  As far as support for \"outdated\" operating systems goes, support\
      \ for Windows 98/ME ends June 30, 2006 (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;[LN];LifeAn1),\
      \ and I would hope that developers would choose to stick with that.  Granted,\
      \ there are some odds and ends when porting between operating systems, but,\
      \ for the most part, windows code is pretty portable with itself, especially\
      \ when using directx api.  Though I think the original rant was about how the\
      \ website (http://www.dxinvisiblewar.com/) doesn't show system requirements.\n\
      \n'''El Muerte:''' The windows quircks are the issue, not directx. Microsoft\
      \ often changes little things that have a major impact on the program. This\
      \ requires you to include an additional OS in the whole testing cycle. That\
      \ adding an extra OS is a lot of work. When looking for what OS to support you\
      \ just have to take a look at OS people would use that have the minimum system\
      \ requirements (hardare only). For example it's impossible to use Win95 or Win98fe\
      \ when you have an AMD Athlon. And using Win98se or WinME with a newer CPU,\
      \ like Pentium 4 or Athlon XP\\Athlon 64, is just simply a waste of resources.\n\
      \n'''Legal:''' When I bought this computer three years ago it came with Windows\
      \ ME. It's got a Pentium 4 processor anyway, as Win XP wasn't even available\
      \ yet. I haven't reinstalled Windows once, and I wont do so just because developers\
      \ wont make their games work with my OS. If they don't want my moneyt, fine,\
      \ I'll just warez it once I finally do have to upgrade. At least I hope I wont\
      \ have to upgrade before the current games are off the market.\n\nI wouldn't\
      \ be surprised if Epic and other developers are in fact getting their software\
      \ for free as long as they neglect support for older OS's. Let's face it, make\
      \ something only work with the latest OS makes people more likely to upgrade.\
      \ Judging by the official XP map pack and latest patch which destroys UED, Epic\
      \ has since Unreal grown less and less interested in widening their community,\
      \ but rather making people stick to their specs so they wont have to do such\
      \ horrible things as testing their stuff on more than three machines.\n\n'''Dragonmaw:'''\
      \ I've only played Deus Ex 2's demo, but I can already tell you I hate it. \
      \ It's too linear for my tastes.  In the orginal you could go wandering around\
      \ the city.  In the new one, it tells you exactly where to go and when to go.\
      \  It takes the exploration fun out of the game.\n\nI've also played Thief 3\
      \ on the Xbox, and it purrs.  It not only purrs, it's one of the best games\
      \ I have played in a long, long time.  The control scheme was nice, the AI was\
      \ adequate, nothing like Far Cry, but the gameplay was immersive and expansive.\
      \  My kind of game.\n\nI don't know about the PC version though.\n\n'''Genetik:'''\
      \ I see no reason to hate developers over not supporting Win98. Recently on\
      \ BuF someone was having difficulties with UT2004, and the screenie they provided\
      \ showed they were running Win98. They were heartily laughed at. ''Of course''.\
      \ It's 6-year-old software, and there's no reason anyone should continue to\
      \ be bothered by it's flaws/lack of functionality anymore. Same goes for Me,\
      \ which was certainly the buggiest and most annoying peice of crap that ever\
      \ wasted HD space, even for it's release date. I'm not (I reapeat NOT) going\
      \ to delay release of any software of mine because it doesn't support Win 3.1,\
      \ 98, or any other outdated OS.\n\n'''Mosquito:''' Windows 2000 and XP are so\
      \ vastly superior to 98/ME its foolish to continue to support them. Unless you\
      \ want a legacy machine, theres no excuse for using them.\n\n'''dataangel''':\
      \ The OS ranting is, frankly, stupid. Nobody supports Windows95 anymore. Lo\
      \ and behold, that's starting to happen to Windows98. You make it sound like\
      \ Eidos/Ion is committing some unheard of attrocity. WinME is pretty much just\
      \ 98 with DOS stripped off. It endured a very short life &ndash; it's market\
      \ share is 'tiny'. If I was publishing a game I'd do the same &ndash; I don't\
      \ want tons of support calls from 98 users running unstable systems. The card\
      \ ranting is stupid too. Geforce3+ cards are the only ones supported because\
      \ they're the only ones PHYSICALLY capable of handling the rendering &ndash;\
      \ even if they coded the most efficient shadowing system in the world, Geforce2\
      \ era cards simply don't have the necessary instructions to support real time\
      \ shadows. The only workaround is an emulator, which would be horribly slow\
      \ no matter how you worked it. Yes, Eidos/Ion screwed up tons with DX2 and Thief3,\
      \ but here they did not, and because of your disappointment you're just looking\
      \ to point out any fault you can, even if it means making them up. That or you're\
      \ ignorant of the differences between modern Windows OSs and video cards and\
      \ those of the past.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Saying things are stupid, is stupididy\
      \ itself.:P\n\n'''Legal:''' Most of the original rant of mine was actually what\
      \ I thought before I ordered the game. Lack of motivation and a huge amount\
      \ of homework made me ignore it the time. When I found out that the demo wasn't\
      \ working I began actually writing it all down, of course with the utter lazyness\
      \ of the Thief 3 developers to even test the game. Statements by people working\
      \ there saying \"it might work on some laptops, but we didn't think about testing\
      \ them\" and basing assumptions on wether it'll run or not on speculation isn't\
      \ what I'd call professional. They have a budget, they actually get payed, hence\
      \ they should make sure to test it on all the basic configurations of systems\
      \ users may try to run it on.\n\nFurthermore, things such as not marketing it\
      \ better than any 12-year old could and listing cards that can't be used on\
      \ the '''forums''' and not the '''site''' gives me the impression of ION Storm\
      \ and Eidos not giving a shit wheter I buy it or not. Which, as anyone might\
      \ guess, is what the title of this page is based on.\n\nTo release games such\
      \ as Doom 3, Thief 3, and other new similar at a time where a large part of\
      \ the market is using Geforce 4 MX cards, Windows 98SE/ME and the other things\
      \ in the great list of what you can't do, I find the very idea of not creating\
      \ fallback systems ignorant. It's quite obvious that people will be more likely\
      \ to pirate a single player game without any multiplayer support or editor than\
      \ building their own Geforce FX.\n\nI really find your fanboy approach to my\
      \ rant interesting, not to say amusing. Did you even read the arguments at the\
      \ top? All of what's listed are the very most basic demands from the public\
      \ and companies who care about selling their game. Again, the basic rant (that's\
      \ all of what's above the \"Comments\" section) is completely related to the\
      \ title and reason for this page.\n\nPerhaps, instead of going berzerk on what\
      \ I think, you could write up a long list of the things that were made right?\
      \ I have no doubt it's a great game, but I find the reasoning of developers\
      \ nowadays to be that of a large corporation we call \"Microsoft\". \"Buy the\
      \ hard/software we use or it's your own fault you can't play our games\".\n\n\
      As many things Epic has done wrong with the Unreal 2 Engine, they '''did do'''\
      \ one thing right, where other companies fail. They created a high profile graphics\
      \ engine first, then added one or sometimes even '''two or three''' levels of\
      \ fallbacks. This gave them the market of both Linux, Mac and those who still\
      \ finds UT1 fun enough not to upgrade.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Rant|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
