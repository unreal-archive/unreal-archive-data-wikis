      \ CD, I belive Epic could have sent me a box of gravel instead. UED3 takes the\
      \ prize. Sure, UED2 was buggy, but it was predictable. It felt more like an\

      <p>I can't create .ase files with any program, so no special collision for my\
      \ SM's. If it crashes, which you can be sure it'll do before you've had time\
      \ to get started properly, you have to reboot in order to start UED again. Needless\
      \ to say, rebooting every 15 minutes is mildly amusing. Could we PLEASE get\
      \ an UED that works with the most common OS's with UT2004?</p>\n<p>That being\
      \ AT LEAST WinME and later.</p>\n<p>Seeing how the reason I bought UT2003 was\
      \ to mod the game rather than play it (the game itself wasn't much of a hit\

      \ uptime was 29 minutes. Also, when it crashes I have to reboot.</li>\n<li>I\
      \ still haven't had much reason to use KAT as...</li>\n<li>Maya doesn't work\
      \ at all unless you have Windows 2000 or later. Of course, before you realize\
      \ that's the problem, you have to go through the most complicated set of forms\
      \ I've seen for something meant to be free. After one hour of this procedure,\
      \ I think I should be payed to go on. Never the less, I work my way forward\
      \ and get the damn key needed to start, only to see Maya detect I have Win ME\
      \ which is too old. Having been working for 15 minutes on a mailbomb, destination\
      \ AliasWavefront, I give up and will later be found dressed in pyjamas on a\
      \ big grass field screaming \"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So,\
      \ I try getting a pirate version of 3DS Max 4. Having struggled for a week trying\
      \ to get it to work, I give up. I manage to get version 5 and try getting that\
      \ to work. Having given up a week later, I recieve version 6, supposed to be\
      \ cracked and working. Smiling like a cat who found your Prozac I try to install.\
      \ I get an error message not even UED has given me: \"Can not install - You\
      \ need Internet Explorer version 6 or later\". Confused, I manage to find IE6\
      \ on Microsoft's site after hours of searching. I install, and when I reopen\
      \ the install I see a button cleverly hidden among the others: \"Install Internet\
      \ Explorer 6\". Oh well, there's no need to get angry over that, now I can finally\
      \ install!</p>\n<p>After 10 minutes of frantic testing how to work around the\
      \ next error message, I give up - \"Error: You need Windows NT4, 2000, XP or\
      \ later in order to install 3DS Max\". WAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\
      \ DIE EVIL HUMANS!</p>\n<p>So, what did I get out of this easteregg adventure\
      \ courtesy Epic? At least I can see the Wiki sidebar thanks to MSIE6...</p>\n\
      <p>UT2004 better be cheap or have bonus material compatible with any standard\
      \ comp, or I'm going to demand a refund - Epic, fear my wrath!</p>\n<h2><span\
