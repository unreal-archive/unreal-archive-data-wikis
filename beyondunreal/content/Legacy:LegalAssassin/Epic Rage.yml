      \ This the way it was (mostly at least) in UT. Yes, there were mini packages\

      \ UT were simply enough in GenEarth.utx or maybe another package (if a special\
      \ was needed) when they are spread across five packages, none of them named\
      \ anything logic like Ground.utx or Snow.utx. Sure, often you find the package\
      \ names logic, but the ones named after the map are awful for easy finding.\
      \ Unless I know ArboreaTerrain.utx was the right one (I'm probably wrong again),\
      \ I'll spend time opening desert/tropic packages before finding snow.</p>\n\
