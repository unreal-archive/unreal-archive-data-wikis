      <p>This is going to be the home page for documentation on how the UnrealScript\
      \ classes get called in the VM from the native engine code. It will probably\
      \ always be imcomplete. But it should provide a good starting point for those\
      \ who are trying to learn \"what gets called when\".</p>\n<p>There are three\
      \ objectives here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Define important game events</li>\n<li>Document\
      \ UScript class entry points</li>\n<li>Create flowcharts for important game\
      \ event cycles</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First, we'll try to define the set of \"important\"\
      \ game events, such as game start, map change, player spawn, etc. These are\
      \ not necessarily \"events\" in the UScript sense, but they are often related.\
      \ These would simply be definitions of terms for reference in the other areas\
      \ here.</p>\n<p>Second, each of the methods in any classes (or derived classes)\
      \ that are called directly by the engine would be documented on a per-class\
      \ basis. This is a reference-style section, so you can look at a class and see\
      \ what types of game events cause method calls for this class.</p>\n<p>Note:\
      \ Events should be documented in the \"least derived class\" for which they\
      \ are relevant. Thus, events that are really designed for the UnrealPawn class\
      \ should be documented there, not in Actor, nor in xPawn. This is a judgment\
      \ call, but we should try to keep it as clear and intuitive as possible.</p>\n\
      <p>Third, something that I think would help tremendously in the learning process\
      \ would be graphical flowcharts that show \"game cycles\" and how they work.\
      \ So, for example, what happens when a player joins a game, or a projectile\
      \ is fired? There are a number of key methods (listed in the above section)\
      \ that are called, in a very specific order.</p>\n<p>We don't need to get down\
      \ to the microscopic source-level, as that would be redundant with reading the\
      \ sources. But a high-level view of important processes in the game will be\
      \ very useful.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Status\">Status</span><span\

      <p><b>Wormbo:</b> Please concider using the existing structure of subpages.\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor/Methods\" title=\"Legacy:Actor/Methods\">Actor/Methods</a>\
      \ and <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Object/Methods?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Object/Methods (page does not exist)\">Object/Methods</a> would be much\
      \ more suitable names IMHO.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> ...or <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor/Events\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Actor/Events\">Actor/Events</a> and <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Object/Events?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Object/Events (page does not exist)\">Object/Events</a>\
      \ in this case. Nice work though. I can move the pages if you want.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ I just realized that <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor/Events\" title=\"Legacy:Actor/Events\"\
      >Actor/Events</a> exists and has a different purpose – but looking at it I think\
      \ it could be safely deleted and replaced by what you're doing here.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ I vote to keep <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor/Events\" title=\"Legacy:Actor/Events\"\
      >Actor/Events</a> because it describes a property group in UnrealEd just like\
      \ e.g. <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor/Collision\" title=\"Legacy:Actor/Collision\"\
      >Actor/Collision</a> does. UnrealScript events are just methods after all.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Lazarus:</b> But they're not really just methods, because they are initiated\
      \ by the engine, as opposed to being called directly by a mod's code. I agree\
      \ there may be a better way to integrate this documentation with the rest of\
      \ the site, but the intent (as I just noted in the text above) is to keep it\
      \ \"event-specific\".</p>\n<p>I know this might be considered an artificial\
      \ distinction from a certain point of view, but understanding event triggering\
      \ (when and how) is extremely critical to being able to layout the foundation\
      \ for a mod. It's easy to get lost in class documentation and \"lose the thread\"\
      \ of event flow. That's why I wanted to do this.</p>\n<p>It's possible the solution\
      \ is to integrate some of the info in the subpages into the class documentation.\
      \ As long as we can annotate which methods are <i>event handlers</i>, that would\
      \ be fine. I just didn't want to start mucking about with everyone else's documentation.&#160;;)\
      \ I figure I'll keep fleshing it out, and then we can merge what we need to\
      \ in a way that makes sense.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> For now, moved the \"\
      FooClass Events\" pages below <strong class=\"selflink\">UnrealScript Entry\
      \ Points</strong>.</p>\n<p><b>Ch3z:</b> I'm seeing a need for recognition here\
      \ of certain aspects of the engine(s) functionality. It needs a defining name\
      \ along the lines of ummm maybe Execution Flow (??) or along the lines of that.\
      \ And we need some kind of a starting point for naviagating pages that offer\
      \ insight on this aspect.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> How does <a href=\"/Legacy:Game_Event_Flow\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Game Event Flow\">Game Event Flow</a> fit in here? Needs linkage\
      \ to that and other relevant parts of the wiki.</p>\n<p><b>OlympusMons:</b>\
      \ Now I see why there was a seperate page for the player controller events,\
      \ maybe it shouldnt be deleted just todo'd...</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Is this\
      \ page REALLY needed? It seems like all of this is probably covered throughout\
      \ the rest of the wiki?</p>\n<p><b>Charon:</b> @MythOpus I think it IS needed.\
      \ Just a good place to start and take a first look. It helped me a lot.</p>\n\

      \ Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Chain Of Events At Level Startup|Chain Of Events At Level\
      \ Startup]]\n* [[Legacy:Chain Of Events When Spawning Actors|Chain Of Events\
      \ When Spawning Actors]]\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Please concider\
      \ using the existing structure of subpages. [[Legacy:Actor/Methods|Actor/Methods]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Object/Methods|Object/Methods]] would be much more suitable names\
      \ IMHO.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' ...or [[Legacy:Actor/Events|Actor/Events]] and [[Legacy:Object/Events|Object/Events]]\
      \ in this case.  Nice work though.  I can move the pages if you want.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ I just realized that [[Legacy:Actor/Events|Actor/Events]] exists and has a\
      \ different purpose &ndash; but looking at it I think it could be safely deleted\
      \ and replaced by what you're doing here.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I vote to keep [[Legacy:Actor/Events|Actor/Events]]\
      \ because it describes a property group in UnrealEd just like e.g. [[Legacy:Actor/Collision|Actor/Collision]]\
      \ does. UnrealScript events are just methods after all.\n\n'''Lazarus:''' But\
      \ they're not really just methods, because they are initiated by the engine,\
      \ as opposed to being called directly by a mod's code.  I agree there may be\
      \ a better way to integrate this documentation with the rest of the site, but\
      \ the intent (as I just noted in the text above) is to keep it \"event-specific\"\
      .\n\nI know this might be considered an artificial distinction from a certain\
      \ point of view, but understanding event triggering (when and how) is extremely\
      \ critical to being able to layout the foundation for a mod.  It's easy to get\
      \ lost in class documentation and \"lose the thread\" of event flow.  That's\
      \ why I wanted to do this.\n\nIt's possible the solution is to integrate some\
      \ of the info in the subpages into the class documentation.  As long as we can\
      \ annotate which methods are ''event handlers'', that would be fine.  I just\
      \ didn't want to start mucking about with everyone else's documentation. ;)\
      \  I figure I'll keep fleshing it out, and then we can merge what we need to\
      \ in a way that makes sense.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' For now, moved the \"FooClass\
      \ Events\" pages below [[Legacy:UnrealScript Entry Points|UnrealScript Entry\
      \ Points]].\n\n'''Ch3z:''' I'm seeing a need for recognition here of certain\
      \ aspects of the engine(s) functionality. It needs a defining name along the\
      \ lines of ummm maybe Execution Flow (??) or along the lines of that. And we\
      \ need some kind of a starting point for naviagating pages that offer insight\
      \ on this aspect.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' How does [[Legacy:Game Event Flow|Game\
      \ Event Flow]] fit in here?  Needs linkage to that and other relevant parts\
      \ of the wiki.\n\n'''OlympusMons:''' Now I see why there was a seperate page\
      \ for the player controller events, maybe it shouldnt be deleted just todo'd...\n\
      \n'''MythOpus:''' Is this page REALLY needed?  It seems like all of this is\
      \ probably covered throughout the rest of the wiki?\n\n'''Charon:''' @MythOpus\
      \ I think it IS needed. Just a good place to start and take a first look. It\
      \ helped me a lot."
