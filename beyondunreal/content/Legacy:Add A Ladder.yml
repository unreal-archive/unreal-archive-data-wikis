      <li>Collision -&gt; bBlockKarma = true</li>\n<li>Collision -&gt; bBlockZeroExtentTraces\

      \ will enclose the ladder and ensure that only simplistic collision occurs.</p>\n\
      <p>In order to create the blocking volume you need to <a href=\"/Legacy:Add_A_Volume\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Add A Volume\">Add a Volume</a> with a height, width and breadth\
      \ of 192, 32, and 16 UU respetively. Depending on the orientation of your ladder\

      <p>So, we have the ladder in our map and a mechanism to ensure that the ladder\
      \ is solid. We still can't climb our ladder though. The <a href=\"/Legacy:LadderVolume\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:LadderVolume\">LadderVolume</a> defines the area within which\

      \ builder brush</a> with a height, width, and breadth of 288, 64, 64 UU respectively.\
      \ The height specified is 96 units higher than the ladder's blocking volume.\
      \ This additional height seems to make it easier to get down the ladder without\
      \ having to jump. If you find better values add them to this page. These are\
      \ most likely Devastation specific.</li>\n<li>Left click on the <tt>Add Volume</tt>\
      \ button in the left toolbutton area and select the <tt>LadderVolume</tt> option.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>Players in a ladder volume, obviously, are able to climb; Forward\
      \ will make the character ascend, backward descend.This is only possible when\
      \ the following two criteria are met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The player's <b>forward\
      \ motion is blocked</b> - This means a player wont accidentally start climbing\
      \ while walking through the empty parts of the ladder zone. He has to hit the\
      \ ladder mesh or blocking volume.</li>\n<li>The player is <b>facing the specified\
      \ direction</b> - This means a player can only climb the correct side of a ladder,\
      \ and not the perpendicular wall next to it etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thats quite\
      \ specific, so its reasonably safe to make your volume too big rather than too\
      \ small. Move aside the red builder brush then completely enclose the ladder\
      \ and blocking volume with the ladder volume you just spawned.</p>\n<p>Finally\
      \ you need to specify the direction. The arrow at the centre of the ladder volume\
      \ must point towards the surface you want to climb. You can't set this with\
      \ the mouse, and must instead edit the ladder volume properties-&gt;LadderVolume-&gt;WallDir\
      \ (And most likely the yaw)</p>\n<p>Common values are: North=49152, East=0,\

      \n}}\n\nThis page describes how a ladder is built.  The description of the steps\
      \ required has been taken from the game [[Legacy:Devastation|Devastation]].\
      \  It is expected that the process for other unreal engine based games will\
      \ be similar if not identical.\n\nA ladder is composed of three main elements\
      \ (five if you include the autogenerated ladder paths).  These elements are:\n\
      * The ladder static mesh (just for the look of the thing)\n* The blocking volume\
      \ used to \"cover\" the ladder (for [[Legacy:Collision|collision]] purposes:\
      \ quicker than per-poly collision)\n* The LadderVolume itself (makes the player\
      \ climb)\n* Two auto generated Ladder pathnodes ([[Legacy:AutoLadder|AutoLadder]]\
      \ objects for [[Legacy:Bot Support|bot support]])\n\n==Adding the Ladder==\n\
      # The first thing you need to do is add your ladder object to the map. I used\
      \ the ladder [[Legacy:Static Mesh|static mesh]] <tt>AbitladderA</tt> from the\
      \ <tt>Aquifiers</tt> package: [[Legacy:Add A Static Mesh|Add a static mesh]]\
      \ <tt>Aquifiers.AbitladderA</tt>. Place it on the wall where you wish the ladder\
      \ to be.\n# The ladder itself is 32 [[Legacy:UU|UU]] wide and 192 UU high. \
      \ You will most likely find that you will have to rotate the ladder into the\
      \ correct orientation and move it into position.\n# Once you have got the ladder\
      \ into position it is well worth changing the [[Legacy:Collision|collision]]\
      \ properties on the ladder to ensure good performance. So [[Legacy:Set The Following\
      \ Properties|Set the following properties]]:\n#*  Collision -> bBlockKarma =\
      \ true\n#*  Collision -> bBlockZeroExtentTraces = true\n#*  Collision -> bCollideActors\
      \ = true\n\nYour ladder is now ready for use.\n\n==Add a Blocking Volume==\n\
      \nYou may have noticed that our ladder does not block any of the Actors within\
      \ the game. We are going to use a [[Legacy:BlockingVolume|BlockingVolume]] for\
      \ this purpose.  The BlockingVolume will enclose the ladder and ensure that\
      \ only simplistic collision occurs.\n\nIn order to create the blocking volume\
      \ you need to [[Legacy:Add A Volume|Add a Volume]] with a height, width and\
      \ breadth of 192, 32, and 16 UU respetively.  Depending on the orientation of\
      \ your ladder you may need to swap the breadth and width values around.\n\n\
      A white cube will now appear in your level.  Move the red builder brush out\
      \ of the way and position your new blocking volume over the ladder.\n\n==Adding\
      \ the LadderVolume==\n\nSo, we have the ladder in our map and a mechanism to\
      \ ensure that the ladder is solid.  We still can't climb our ladder though.\
      \ The [[Legacy:LadderVolume|LadderVolume]] defines the area within which the\
      \ \"ladder effect\" will occur. \n\n* Create a cube using the [[Legacy:Red Builder\
      \ Brush|red builder brush]] with a height, width, and breadth of 288, 64, 64\
      \ UU respectively.  The height specified is 96 units higher than the ladder's\
      \ blocking volume.  This additional height seems to make it easier to get down\
      \ the ladder without having to jump.  If you find better values add them to\
      \ this page.  These are most likely Devastation specific.\n* Left click on the\
      \ <tt>Add Volume</tt> button in the left toolbutton area and select the <tt>LadderVolume</tt>\
      \ option.\n\nPlayers in a ladder volume, obviously, are able to climb; Forward\
      \ will make the character ascend, backward descend.This is only possible when\
      \ the following two criteria are met:\n* The player's '''forward motion is blocked'''\
      \ - This means a player wont accidentally start climbing while  walking through\
      \ the empty parts of the ladder zone. He has to hit the ladder mesh or blocking\
      \ volume.\n* The player is '''facing the specified direction''' - This means\
      \ a player can only climb the correct side of a  ladder, and not the perpendicular\
      \ wall next to it etc\n\nThats quite specific, so its reasonably safe to make\
      \ your volume too big rather than too small. Move aside the red builder brush\
      \ then completely enclose the ladder and blocking volume with the ladder volume\
      \ you just spawned.\n\nFinally you need to specify the direction. The arrow\
      \ at the centre of the ladder volume must point towards the surface you want\
      \ to climb. You can't set this with the mouse, and must instead edit the ladder\
      \ volume properties->LadderVolume->WallDir (And most likely the yaw)\n\nCommon\
      \ values are: North=49152, East=0, South=16384, West=32768.\n\n==The finishing\
      \ touches==\n\nIn order to make your ladder actually work you will need to [[Legacy:Rebuild|rebuild]]\
