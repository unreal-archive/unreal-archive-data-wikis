    text: "<dl>\n<dd>For non-generic sub-topics, a redirect to the sub-topic should\
      \ exist as a root topic (using the markup <tt>#REDIRECT <i>link</i></tt>). This\
      \ eliminates the possibility of someone constructing a root page out of ignorance\
      \ of the sub-topic page's existance. It also makes linking to the sub-topic\
      \ easier (pages can be marked <tt><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Working_With_Actors?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Working With Actors (page does not exist)\">Working\
      \ With Actors</a></tt> instead of <tt><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Actor/Working_With_Actors?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Actor/Working With Actors (page does not exist)\"\

      \ for genericly named sub-topics. For example, \"Properties,\" as a sub-topic,\
      \ needs to be defined differently for each root topic – a root topic redirect\
      \ page named \"Properties\" is not useful. As an alternative, a root level page\
      \ named as the complete topic+sub-topic could act as redirects to sub-topic\
      \ pages. Ex: <tt><a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_Properties\" title=\"Legacy:Actor Properties\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\">Actor Properties</a></tt> might be a good root topic\
      \ to create as a redirect to <tt><a href=\"/Legacy:Actor/Properties\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Actor/Properties\">Actor/Properties</a></tt>. – <i>Aedis</i></dd>\n<dd>That's\

      \ having it show up in a search, but the search results pages will always be\
      \ a fairly chaotic list, it's a bad idea to try and force a hierarchy. By all\
