      \ and moving the mouse over your terrain will paint more white onto the selected\
      \ texture, and holding down Ctrl+RMB and doing the same will paint more black.\
      \ This has different effects depending on what you are painting (see below).</p>\n\
      <p>This tool is mostly useful in a 3D <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Viewport\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport\">UnrealEd Viewport</a>, though it will work\
      \ in an Orthogonal viewpoint, which can be handy for working with texture layers\
      \ (you'll need to enable terrain view in that viewport first).</p>\n<h3><span\

      <p>By far the most common use of the Painting Tool will be with the heightmap\
      \ for you terrain. Ensure that it is selected in the Terrain Editing window\
      \ (the Terrains tab about half-way down the window should display all the heightmaps\
      \ in your map) and then begin painting. The heightmap is based on having white\
      \ represent the highest point in your map and black the lowest, so if you use\
      \ the LMB to paint the Painting Tool adds more white to your heightmap, and\
      \ the height of the terrain will increase. You can use this to make moutains,\
      \ valleys, whatever you want.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Painting_Texture_Layers\"\

      \ or unmask <a href=\"/Legacy:Terrain_Texture_Layer\" title=\"Legacy:Terrain\
      \ Texture Layer\">terrain texture layers</a> on your terrain. You do this much\
      \ as you would a heightmap, just select your texture layer in the Layers tab\
      \ of the Terrain Editing window and being painting. Here, adding more white\
      \ (LMB) causes the texture to become more opaque, and more black (RMB) causes\
      \ it to become more transparent.</p>\n<p>If you remove every layer from your\
      \ terrain it will become invisible, so if your terrain suddenly vanishes while\
      \ working with this tool, just switch to the wireframe <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Viewport\"\
