      \ know in what end to start? Perhaps you have already created a singleplayer\
      \ map but you feel that it is missing that little “extra”. In the following\
      \ documentation you’ll read about how to create a better singleplayer experience…\
      </p>\n<p>NOTE that this is not a pure tutorial - in some places I might describe\
      \ how to make stuff but you should not count on it.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Lighting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>You might think wonder “what difference may sp lighting\
      \ do compared to lighting in multiplayer maps?” Well not much really J</p>\n\
      <p>Although you need to plan your lighting a bit better - in multiplayer a lot\
      \ of people turn lighting off to see all of the level unlit. There are not many\
      \ people who do the same in singleplayer maps. Lighting is an important factor\
      \ in the atmosphere of a level and atmosphere in singleplayer maps is more important\
      \ than in multiplayer maps. Remember the flickering corridors in Doom, and it\
      \ gave you that “omg Omg OMg OMG!!!!” feeling?</p>\n<p>One must remember that\
      \ lighting is not just the presence of light, but also the absence of it. Use\
      \ shadows to your advantage when covering enemies and secret areas (more on\
      \ secret areas in “Use of environment”) Allot of people don’t use that much\
      \ of coloured lights anymore, which I find to be a shame. I mean look around\
      \ yourself, the light you see around you is not just one colour, and if it is\
      \ it sure as *ell not white/uncoloured. When coloured lighting was introduced\
      \ in Quake 2 (It was first, right?) Everyone thought “oooh yeeeey… that looks\
      \ awesome!!” And with Unreal it was “OOOOH YEA!! HOLY MOTHER!!!” Unreal has\
      \ one of the most advanced lighting engines to date, use it.</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Think not only in the ways of “light there and light there” but also\
      \ in the ways of absence of light. Hide enemies in shadows, use special effects\
      \ such as flickering, Strobe and other to create a rich light map.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Use_of_environment\">Use of environment</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mapping_For_Unreal_SinglePlayer?section=4\" title=\"Edit\
      \ section: Use of environment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A very important factor in singleplayer levels is\
      \ that the environment feels realistic for what’s going on, meaning that if\
      \ you are making a level which has the story of a wrecked alien city you don’\
      t go build a medival castle… “But of course” you say but remember the case mentioned\
      \ above, was a extreme chase. Small things such as miss aligned textures, poor\
      \ use of textures or perhaps a misplaced powerup can completely ruin a level.</p>\n\
      <p>Be smart in the design of the level. Use the <a href=\"/Legacy:Z-Axis\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Z-Axis\">Z-axis</a> (up and down, folks) in your work; surprise the player\
      \ with special effects and, of course, overwhelming architecture.</p>\n<p>One\
      \ thing that I miss in today’s games is the \"Secret areas\" where goodies such\
      \ as weapons or armors can be found. Hide secret passages in shadows and/or\
      \ use natural covers (Trees, bushes, rocks etc).</p>\n<p>Also when you make\
      \ Castles or houses or facilities remember to make the realistic and make sure\
      \ that the architecture is natural and doesn’t get in the players way. Also\
      \ make sure that the creatures that inhabit the place find it easy to navigate.\
      \ Make multiple rooms with areas such as sleeping halls, libraries, engine rooms,\
      \ dining rooms, transport tunnels - anything to make the building feel realistic\
      \ for its purpose (I find it hard to believe that an alien race invaded a planet\
      \ only to build useless buildings on it.)</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use\
      \ the Z-Axis to your advantage by not only building the level on the X and Y\
      \ axis. Be a perfectionist! Look for small flaws such as wrongly aligned textures\
      \ alike and correct them.</li>\n<li>Make Eye candy – when everyone says “Gameplay\
      \ comes first” they are correct, however this doesn’t disable you from making\
      \ a good-looking level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bottom line is what looks good and plays\
      \ good is good level Environmental wise.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"Holding_up_a_storyline_and_keeping_it_exciting\">Holding up a storyline\
      \ and keeping it exciting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Holding up a storyline and keeping it exciting\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>You should have\
      \ completed the entire story and plot before starting the work on the level/levels\
      \ and it should contain information about what will be told (using the translator).\
      \ Just as in a good book the ending should be surprising and to do this you\
      \ should lead the player into a, so to say, “different direction” so when the\
      \ ending does appear he is totally unprepared for it (Mentally wise). You can\
      \ also use Translator events in an “unknowing way” - meaning that you, for example,\
      \ stumble across a few dead corpses of a few humans who have had “Sightings\
      \ of a aggressive species”. The player feel a bit excited for seeing this “\
      Aggressive species” as well as he is a bit afraid to encounter it.</p>\n<p>Another\
      \ thing which is very effective is a simple change of music. Switching from\
      \ calm music to an echoeing silence will make the player cautious, and maybe\
      \ afriad. The opposite to. Just when the player thinks its over you can suddenly\
      \ change the music for a \"surprising\" feel.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The following section is for the ones who feel they\
      \ want to do more than just Translator events to be the main source of information…\
      \ How to accomplish this? Use movies/in game sequences. Ill tell you about the\
      \ latter first:</p>\n<p>By saying \"in game sequences\" I mean Scripted sequences…\
      \ still not with me? Remember the Skaarj that ran away in the first level of\
      \ Unreal when you got the dispersion pistol? Or perhaps when the poor guy gets\
      \ thrown into a wall followed by a couple of rockets from a brute? That is what\
      \ I am talking about. This may not be the CLEAREST way of telling the story\
      \ (And you should not only use this method) but it’s a real cool thing that\
      \ I use a lot in my levels. It don’t just have to be made to tell the story\
      \ but just as a “cool thing” to have in your level. See more on scripted sequences\
      \ down below.</p>\n<p>You can go one step longer and use movies, using the game\
      \ engine, to tell the story – have you ever heard of the word “Machinima”? Its\
      \ another word for “Movies which uses a game engine” (Good short, eh?) This\
      \ is easily made in the powerful tool put together by the great Unframed Team\
      \ (www.unframed.org) called UMS or Unreal Movie Studio (see <a href=\"/Legacy:Capturing_Unreal_Video\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Capturing Unreal Video\">Capturing Unreal Video</a>). In it\
      \ you will find a lot of useful features that will enable to make your level\
      \ a interactive movie if you so want J. If you feel that you just wish to use\
      \ the regular tools already existing in UnrealED (or are just to tired to learn\
      \ some new tool) you can make less advanced movies using just UnrealED (But\
      \ it will take longer time and is more difficult and uncontrollable)</p>\n<p>In\
      \ short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hide the true objective of the campaign until the very\
      \ end of the scenario.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Inventory_Item_Placement\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>A very important topic as the placement of the weapons\
      \ and powerups are <b>vital</b> to build a level.</p>\n<p>The best way to find\
      \ out what is needed and what weapon/powerup feels right at a certain spot is\
      \ simply to play the level (Using no cheats). Keep in mind that there are worse\
      \ people than you that are going to play the level so don’t place the weapon\
      \ so you barely survive.</p>\n<p>In Short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aw cmon… The info\
      \ stated above is NOT very long… Read it trough you lazy sob J</li>\n</ul>\n\

      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The main factor in a good\
      \ level is really the characters you meet in it and who you are fighting because\
      \ think of it – if people want to play an quest based game they will not play\
      \ Unreal but some adventure game. The creatures in your level must feel realistic\
      \ for the level and must not feel misplaced. It really helps if the Creature\
      \ is not just standing in one place doing nothing. Simple Scripted sequences\
      \ such as Patrolling creatures and on Skaarj creatures you can place them behind\
      \ a keyboard and use the option “buttonpushener”. A useful simple sequence is\
      \ the sleeping Krall - Go into Krall properties and then display. Under animation\
      \ type either Sleep1, sleep 2 or sleep3 to get the Krall far into the land of\
      \ dreams (which cant be THAT far from the Unreal universe J</p>\n<p>That covers\
      \ the “Basics” of this section so now lets move into the more advanced stuff.</p>\n\
      <p>The little actor called <a href=\"/Legacy:AlarmPoint\" title=\"Legacy:AlarmPoint\"\
      >AlarmPoint</a> mostly makes scripted sequences in Unreal and this little actor\
      \ is somewhat awesome. You can get the Creatures to fight each other, you can\
      \ make the buggers flee, push a button and even take alternative routes to attack\
      \ the player by using only this actor.</p>\n<p>Learning this actor is VITAL\
      \ for you to bring the community a good singleplayer experience: find out more\
      \ about it on the <a href=\"/Legacy:ScriptedPawn\" title=\"Legacy:ScriptedPawn\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It has to be fun.</p>\n<p>That sentance may seem like\
      \ a \"well duh!\" kind of thing, but, sadly, this cruitial factor is missing\
      \ from alot of custom single player maps I have played. Dont make it so hard\
      \ you have to try 7,415,151,337 times to beat it. Dont make puzzles that are\
      \ near impossible to solve. (ie: you must shoot an invisible trgger in the darkest\
      \ part of the room then blah blah blah, just to open a single door (unless it\
      \ is a secret area or, of course, the player is expected to accidentally shoot\
      \ the trigger in the middle of a firefight.) that you must solve to continue.\
      \ Dont make the puzzles to simple either.</p>\n<p>Also dont make fights to boring\
      \ or to long. Nothing is more annoying in a game to work for 10 minutes to get\
      \ one shot one soem boss monster thingy and you realize you must do it 99 more\
      \ times.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_Links\">External\

    text: "''Originally published at [http://www.unrealsp.org UnrealSP.org] by Drevlin\
      \ and eVOLVE''\n\n==Introduction==\n\nYou want to create a singleplayer level\
      \ but don’t know in what end to start? Perhaps you have already created a singleplayer\
      \ map but you feel that it is missing that little “extra”. In the following\
      \ documentation you’ll read about how to create a better singleplayer experience…\
      \n\nNOTE that this is not a pure tutorial - in some places I might describe\
      \ how to make stuff but you should not count on it.\n\n====Index====\n# Lighting\n\
      # Use of environment \n# Holding up a storyline and keeping it exciting. \n\
      # Weapon / powerup placement \n# Creatures and scripted sequences\n# Various\
      \ small tips for Singleplayer mappers\n\n==Lighting==\n\nYou might think wonder\
      \ “what difference may sp lighting do compared to lighting in multiplayer maps?”\
      \ Well not much really J\n\nAlthough you need to plan your lighting a bit better\
      \ - in multiplayer a lot of people turn lighting off to see all of the level\
      \ unlit. There are not many people who do the same in singleplayer maps. Lighting\
      \ is an important factor in the atmosphere of a level and atmosphere in singleplayer\
      \ maps is more important than in multiplayer maps. Remember the flickering corridors\
      \ in Doom, and it gave you that “omg Omg OMg OMG!!!!” feeling? \n\nOne must\
      \ remember that lighting is not just the presence of light, but also the absence\
      \ of it. Use shadows to your advantage when covering enemies and secret areas\
      \ (more on secret areas in “Use of environment”) Allot of people don’t use that\
      \ much of coloured lights anymore, which I find to be a shame. I mean look around\
      \ yourself, the light you see around you is not just one colour, and if it is\
      \ it sure as *ell not white/uncoloured. When coloured lighting was introduced\
      \ in Quake 2 (It was first, right?) Everyone thought “oooh yeeeey… that looks\
      \ awesome!!” And with Unreal it was “OOOOH YEA!! HOLY MOTHER!!!” Unreal has\
      \ one of the most advanced lighting engines to date, use it. \n\nIn short:\n\
      * Think not only in the ways of “light there and light there” but also in the\
      \ ways of absence of light. Hide enemies in shadows, use special effects such\
      \ as flickering, Strobe and other to create a rich light map. \n\n==Use of environment==\n\
      \nA very important factor in singleplayer levels is that the environment feels\
      \ realistic for what’s going on, meaning that if you are making a level which\
      \ has the story of a wrecked alien city you don’t go build a medival castle…\
      \ “But of course” you say but remember the case mentioned above, was a extreme\
      \ chase. Small things such as miss aligned textures, poor use of textures or\
      \ perhaps a misplaced powerup can completely ruin a level.\n\nBe smart in the\
      \ design of the level. Use the [[Legacy:Z-Axis|Z-axis]] (up and down, folks)\
      \ in your work; surprise the player with special effects and, of course, overwhelming\
      \ architecture.\n\nOne thing that I miss in today’s games is the \"Secret areas\"\
      \ where goodies such as weapons or armors can be found. Hide secret passages\
      \ in shadows and/or use natural covers (Trees, bushes, rocks etc).\n\nAlso when\
      \ you make Castles or houses or facilities remember to make the realistic and\
      \ make sure that the architecture is natural and doesn’t get in the players\
      \ way. Also make sure that the creatures that inhabit the place find it easy\
      \ to navigate. Make multiple rooms with areas such as sleeping halls, libraries,\
      \ engine rooms, dining rooms, transport tunnels - anything to make the building\
      \ feel realistic for its purpose (I find it hard to believe that an alien race\
      \ invaded a planet only to build useless buildings on it.)\n\nIn short:\n* Use\
      \ the Z-Axis to your advantage by not only building the level on the X and Y\
      \ axis. Be a perfectionist! Look for small flaws such as wrongly aligned textures\
      \ alike and correct them. \n* Make Eye candy &ndash; when everyone says “Gameplay\
      \ comes first” they are correct, however this doesn’t disable you from making\
      \ a good-looking level. \n\nBottom line is what looks good and plays good is\
      \ good level Environmental wise.\n\n==Holding up a storyline and keeping it\
      \ exciting ==\n\nYou should have completed the entire story and plot before\
      \ starting the work on the level/levels and it should contain information about\
      \ what will be told (using the translator). Just as in a good book the ending\
      \ should be surprising and to do this you should lead the player into a, so\
      \ to say, “different direction” so when the ending does appear he is totally\
      \ unprepared for it (Mentally wise). You can also use Translator events in an\
      \ “unknowing way” - meaning that you, for example, stumble across a few dead\
      \ corpses of a few humans who have had “Sightings of a aggressive species”.\
      \ The player feel a bit excited for seeing this “Aggressive species” as well\
      \ as he is a bit afraid to encounter it.\n\nAnother thing which is very effective\
      \ is a simple change of music. Switching from calm music to an echoeing silence\
      \ will make the player cautious, and maybe afriad. The opposite to. Just when\
      \ the player thinks its over you can suddenly change the music for a \"surprising\"\
      \ feel.\n\n===Advanced Story Telling===\n\nThe following section is for the\
      \ ones who feel they want to do more than just Translator events to be the main\
      \ source of information… How to accomplish this? Use movies/in game sequences.\
      \ Ill tell you about the latter first:\n\nBy saying \"in game sequences\" I\
      \ mean Scripted sequences… still not with me? Remember the Skaarj that ran away\
      \ in the first level of Unreal when you got the dispersion pistol? Or perhaps\
      \ when the poor guy gets thrown into a wall followed by a couple of rockets\
      \ from a brute? That is what I am talking about. This may not be the CLEAREST\
      \ way of telling the story (And you should not only use this method) but it’\
      s a real cool thing that I use a lot in my levels. It don’t just have to be\
      \ made to tell the story but just as a “cool thing” to have in your level. See\
      \ more on scripted sequences down below. \n\nYou can go one step longer and\
      \ use movies, using the game engine, to tell the story &ndash; have you ever\
      \ heard of the word “Machinima”? Its another word for “Movies which uses a game\
      \ engine” (Good short, eh?) This is easily made in the powerful tool put together\
      \ by the great Unframed Team (www.unframed.org) called UMS or Unreal Movie Studio\
      \ (see [[Legacy:Capturing Unreal Video|Capturing Unreal Video]]). In it you\
      \ will find a lot of useful features that will enable to make your level a interactive\
      \ movie if you so want J. If you feel that you just wish to use the regular\
      \ tools already existing in UnrealED (or are just to tired to learn some new\
      \ tool) you can make less advanced movies using just UnrealED (But it will take\
      \ longer time and is more difficult and uncontrollable)\n\nIn short:\n* Hide\
      \ the true objective of the campaign until the very end of the scenario. \n\n\
      ==Inventory Item Placement==\n\nA very important topic as the placement of the\
      \ weapons and powerups are '''vital''' to build a level. \n\nThe best way to\
      \ find out what is needed and what weapon/powerup feels right at a certain spot\
      \ is simply to play the level (Using no cheats). Keep in mind that there are\
      \ worse people than you that are going to play the level so don’t place the\
      \ weapon so you barely survive. \n\nIn Short:\n* Aw cmon… The info stated above\
      \ is NOT very long… Read it trough you lazy sob J\n\n==Creatures and ScriptedSequences==\n\
      \nThe main factor in a good level is really the characters you meet in it and\
      \ who you are fighting because think of it &ndash; if people want to play an\
      \ quest based game they will not play Unreal but some adventure game. The creatures\
      \ in your level must feel realistic for the level and must not feel misplaced.\
      \ It really helps if the Creature is not just standing in one place doing nothing.\
      \ Simple Scripted sequences such as Patrolling creatures and on Skaarj creatures\
      \ you can place them behind a keyboard and use the option “buttonpushener”.\
      \ A useful simple sequence is the sleeping Krall - Go into Krall properties\
      \ and then display. Under animation type either Sleep1, sleep 2 or sleep3 to\
      \ get the Krall far into the land of dreams (which cant be THAT far from the\
      \ Unreal universe J\n\nThat covers the “Basics” of this section so now lets\
      \ move into the more advanced stuff. \n\nThe little actor called [[Legacy:AlarmPoint|AlarmPoint]]\
      \ mostly makes scripted sequences in Unreal and this little actor is somewhat\
      \ awesome. You can get the Creatures to fight each other, you can make the buggers\
      \ flee, push a button and even take alternative routes to attack the player\
      \ by using only this actor. \n\nLearning this actor is VITAL for you to bring\
      \ the community a good singleplayer experience: find out more about it on the\
      \ [[Legacy:ScriptedPawn|ScriptedPawn]] page.\n\n==Fun Factor==\n\nIt has to\
      \ be fun.\n\nThat sentance may seem like a \"well duh!\" kind of thing, but,\
      \ sadly, this cruitial factor is missing from alot of custom single player maps\
      \ I have played. Dont make it so hard you have to try 7,415,151,337 times to\
      \ beat it. Dont make puzzles that are near impossible to solve. (ie: you must\
      \ shoot an invisible trgger in the darkest part of the room then blah blah blah,\
      \ just to open a single door (unless it is a secret area or, of course, the\
      \ player is expected to accidentally shoot the trigger in the middle of a firefight.)\
      \ that you must solve to continue. Dont make the puzzles to simple either.\n\
      \nAlso dont make fights to boring or to long. Nothing is more annoying in a\
      \ game to work for 10 minutes to get one shot one soem boss monster thingy and\
      \ you realize you must do it 99 more times.\n\n==External Links==\n\nSites dedicated\

      \n'''SuperApe:''' I'm close to releasing a SP gametype mod as part of a mapping\

      \ more SP mapping experience, I'd like to revisit this page.  Just to clean\
      \ it up; the technical info for my mod should be the same as old UT, so this\
      \ would be used as a reference for both.  The concepts are the same, I just\
      \ want to format and clarify some of these things.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' removed\
      \ bolding from ebd.  Will revise this page soon.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
