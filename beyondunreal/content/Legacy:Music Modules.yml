    text: "<p>Music Modules (MODs) are a mix of streaming audio and direct music.\
      \ MODs work a lot like MIDIs. They tell when, how long and at what pitch each\
      \ instrument should play. However, unlike direct music files, MODs do <i>not</i>\
      \ get their instrument sounds from <i>your</i> sound card. Instead, they have\
      \ an <i>independent</i> instrument library, which was imported into the MODs\
      \ when they were created. So for example, someone imports a custom piano sound\
      \ into a MOD. The program to create MODs now has added the sound to the sound\
      \ library of this particular MOD. Now, by changing the pitch of the sound, the\
      \ program can create from this one piano sound a whole range of piano sounds,\
      \ all at a different note! By manually adding loop start &amp; end points, you\
      \ can make the piano sound loop so you can play this sound as long as you'd\
      \ like. And that's basically how a MOD is made. See also: <a rel=\"nofollow\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>With this knowledge, you now may want to know how\
      \ to create MODs. OK, for that you need some programs to create music modules.\
      \ These are called <i>tracking programs</i>. I recommend using the <i>ModPlug\
      \ Tracker</i>, because it's a Windows based program and very easy to understand.\
      \ You can download the ModPlug Tracker (<i>MPT</i>) at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external text\" href=\"http://www.modplug.com\">ModPlug.com</a>. Explaining\
      \ the whole process of creating a module would be pointless here, since it is\
      \ all explained on <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.zolaweb.com/Zola/trax/MPTracker/MPT.html\"\
      >this</a> page. I'll just give a brief summary of how a MOD is created:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>Find the audio samples (instrument sounds) that you're going to use\
      \ in the MOD and import them into MPT. (samples tab)</li>\n<li>Create loops\
      \ and instruments from the samples, if needed. (samples tab + instruments tab)</li>\n\
      <li>Switch to the patterns tab and hit the keys on your keyboard - almost every\
      \ key produces a different tone of the selected instrument.</li>\n<li>Insert\
      \ the notes (by hitting keys) for your song in the appropriate order from top\
      \ to bottom.</li>\n<li>Each instrument should be assigned to a different channel\
      \ (column). Click play and listen how it sounds. You may need to adjust the\
      \ speed in the Global tab.</li>\n<li>Tweak with the track until you have the\
      \ desired melody.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I suggest you start by creating the basic\
      \ of every song, which is adding the rhythm by importing some drum samples and\
      \ creating the rhythm. You can then copy this block of rhythm and paste it again\
      \ and again so you get a drum loop. You now have the fundation of the song and\
      \ you can expand it by adding other instruments.</p>\n<p><br />\nCreating MODs\
      \ is not easy for everyone. Like learning UEd, it requires a lot of time to\
      \ become a good tracker. If you really want to create your own music, I suggest\
      \ you don't give up easily.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Information_and_Help_Resources\"\
