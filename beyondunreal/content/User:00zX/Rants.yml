      \ ranted on the wiki, mind you I kinda spurt s*^t everywhere so its not hard\
      \ to miss alittle of my dribble. With that I think we'll continue, whats up\
      \ you ask? Where have I been, why the name change? Well its a very long story,\
      \ one of deceit, treachery, heart break and alot of sawed off shotguns and roses\
      \ (a cigar snipper or two and the odd knee capping with base ball bats).</p>\n\
      <p>I made it though and now the FBI has finally allowed me (now the court case\
      \ is over) to surface from witness protection. Its been a long arduous journey\
      \ but Im here.</p>\n<p>So first order of business, UC2004, its pretty much dead.\
      \ Sorry guys, if anyone wants to pick it up feel free to contact me or any of\
      \ the other members to discuss taking it off our hands. Personally I have modified\
      \ designs (which inspired by working with UC2004 and the team) for UT3 which\
      \ are along the <b>championship</b> lines but not in direct relation to 2kx\
      \ itself. I do keep in contact with acouple of the team members (Crotale, Miko\
      \ and EzJamin) but we dont talk as much as we used to, so big shout out to them\
      \ (love ya guys).</p>\n<p>Next up the name, well I got publicly smeared, I wont\
      \ go into it but basically Im happy under this new handle and will continue\
      \ to use it into the future. For the people close to me nothing has changed\
      \ I will forever be Daniel, Dan (hey jess), Danny (yo kat). Now this was alittle\
      \ bit annoying since I had to go through and change alot of things, a few things\
      \ like these rants stayed under the other alias for some time because it was\
      \ such a large task getting rid of the old name (I didnt really realize until\
      \ after I decided).</p>\n<p>I havent actually ever gone anywhere, Ive been lurking\
      \ around, I was without a PC for say 5 months last year and battle with wireless\
      \ broadband bandwith limits currently. Its been all fun and games over here,\
      \ I still keep working though, I'll never stop being a modder. Its in my blood\
      \ it has been ever since that first grenade gibbing in quake demo that was the\
      \ day I knew forsure there was nothing else on this planet for me but being\
      \ a game designer, thats ultimately where I want to be.</p>\n<p>So while I do\
      \ all these programming projects, help to document unreal script and unreal\
      \ engine, its not really what I want to be doing. I do it for the benefit of\
      \ all the young me's out there, the people who were like me when I started and\
      \ need a place to get info, hang out or even rant (go figure&#160;;) ). I really\
      \ am only a hobbyist programmer and dont actually ever see myself doing it professionally,\
      \ I can, but Ive always been better at systems, design flows and the like. Documentation\
      \ actually does interest me and I spent ALOT of time writing/typing, I have\
      \ pages and pages of stuff with the projects here being the short short short\
      \ list, theres just never enough time.</p>\n<p>Now Im really looking to get\
      \ <a href=\"/User:00zX/GameDex_Framework_(UT3)\" title=\"User:00zX/GameDex Framework\
      \ (UT3)\">GameDex</a> out the way so I can move onto giving <a href=\"/User:00zX/Project_Silky_(UDK)\"\
      \ title=\"User:00zX/Project Silky (UDK)\">Project Silky</a> the attention it\
      \ requires, I am looking for people to help me test (if they have programming\
      \ knowledge all the better) but that does have future potential as I have designs\
      \ for modules which extend it further.</p>\n<p>I think I'll leave it there for\
      \ now, dont expect it to take another 3 years for the next rant, Ive got a few\
      \ ideas (yeah proper research even) for acouple of decent rants. This was mainly\
      \ a reintroduction/update, so hey guys, Im back and Im still enjoying the view\
      \ from the top of the solar systems largest volcano&#160;;)</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ I cant help but think more about it. Being part of a console (gamepad) game\
      \ port to PC has given me a different perspective on things, now I would like\
      \ to say its a unique view but there are alot of people who agree. This actually\
      \ came as a shock, although Im primarily a PC gamer Im amazed how I end up defending\
      \ consoles on one front then slamming them on another, I guess its all in the\
      \ hopes of a more \"unified\" coalition of gamers instead of the mess the whole\
      \ industry is in not just PC.</p>\n<p>Sure consoles have better shelf space\
      \ but someone said on beyond unreal that online sales and distribution is where\
      \ its at anyway and with consoles now breaching this barrier they are looking\
      \ to capitalize as much as they can.</p>\n<p>Pretty unfortunate since PC's loose\
      \ more and more to cutdown PC's (consoles) every year and now Mac is banging\
      \ on the door good and proper, novell's hot on vista's heals with XGL. So its\
      \ a very interesting time in the industry. Now we all know that MS is using\
      \ shady tactics to keep a hold of two markets but from what I see they are spreading\
      \ themselves very thin and making themselves and easy target since they can\
      \ only strengthen 1 front with reinforcements if needed. Im alittle worried\
      \ though as the industry is becoming more and more political with those politics\
      \ getting in the way of \"our\" gaming, its not just those companies though\
      \ with gamers themselves taking sides and defending there prefered platform\
      \ even if they dont really have a problem with any gamer. I myself dont have\
      \ problems with most people even if they are 360 or PS3 owners even though they\
      \ are both threatening my PC gaming with their preference. So what if we took\
      \ Platform out of the equation by making all games available on all major platforms\
      \ which can support it say for eg (mac, linux, windows, 360 and PS3) since the\
      \ wii has less power we'll leave it out but there might be instances where that\
      \ will fit as well. No longer are these people a threat but fellow gamers and\
      \ we can put our differences aside as we can all play together and get the same\
      \ games so there is no competition as such between platform exclusiveness but\
      \ puts the emphasis on the games people want to buy rather then the platform.\
      \ Exactly where it should be in my opinion!</p>\n<p>Now this is a quote from\
      \ utforums which I find relevant to this topic and I like how well it comes\
      \ across so I'll post it here for some perspective.</p>\n<div class=\"hidden-block\"\

      >Yeah I dont think shadowrun will be the best example in a for cross platform\
      \ argument especially in UT3's case. The matter at hand is they couldnt say\
      \ oh well 360 gamers can use keyboard and mouse they had to say well they are\
      \ stuck with gamepad no matter what, how can we fix this.\n<p>It being a tactical\
      \ shooter in some sense (others might just call this rpg) gave them a chance\
      \ to say well we can adjust each control setup different, now thats what should\
      \ be done but giving assistance one way or the other shouldnt. Thats why I think\
      \ this is a prime example of things being unfair because they are trying too\
      \ hard to make it fair.</p>\n<p>What I would like to see is more creative solutions\
      \ to the problem over general assists like (autoaim for eg). Things like auto\
      \ center view are perfect examples of things which are suited more to a joystick\
      \ and not a mouse but doesnt offer anything more in that it will make for an\
      \ uneven playing ground. Its kinda like the mousewheel vs direct key selection,\
      \ no one says oh the mousewheel dumbs things down so dont add it in there and\
      \ people dont go on and on about how using the direct key select is unfair.\
      \ Although I think myself some improvements could be made to bring them both\
      \ into line with each other I dont think either is unfair as such.</p>\n<p>Now\
      \ I am alittle sick of this whole oh but it'll \"dumb things down\" debate,\
      \ that whole term is overused, its actually called arcade vs simulation and\
      \ consoles have a tendency to lean towards arcade gameplay over simulations\
      \ unlike PC's which lean the other way a touch more. Now we are talking about\
      \ an arcade action shooter here so any \"dumbing down\" could even benefit gameplay\
      \ you just never know, as UT is a fairly streamlined game compared to tac shooters\
      \ (or RealiSims as I call them ) an all their buttons for various movements\
      \ I dont see this as a good argument.</p>\n<p>I just dont think for this game\
      \ to be cross platform it instantly has to become a console arcade game, it\
      \ could just as easily be done the other way with the PC version directly translating\
      \ to console. With some clever design and input options it could level the playing\
      \ ground for gamepad vs keyboard and mouse on any platform (pc vs pc even).\
      \ Then people can use the control of their choice without having to worry about\
      \ compromise, or one person getting automatic assits to the point of it being\
      \ unfair.</p>\n<p>Changing the gameplay to suit a control scheme is just a compromise\
      \ and in effect does nothing for the issue of cross platform compatible play\
      \ (we could even call it cross controller gaming ) what needs to happen is solutions\
      \ which will bring devices inline without giving one any advantage and without\
      \ adjusting the gameplay to suit either method. The fixes need to be so general\
      \ they dont even need to be control scheme specific (where in some cases they\
      \ might like the mousewheel for eg) but things like center view which can be\
      \ automatic or set to a key can be used on basically any setup.</p>\n<p>I just\
      \ feel thats why shadowrun might not work so well is that people will see the\
      \ benefits of all the assists given to one side or the other and start screaming\
      \ \"botter\", they could have easily developed systems more to do with controls\
      \ and less to do with gameplay to deal with the problem but they didnt which\
      \ does show alittle bit of the easy way out we see from developers these days.</p>\n\
      <p>I do see the different tendencies between gamers and that console gamers\
      \ are the ones more likely to ask for things like third person view in UT3,\
      \ perhaps its a marketing choice that the gamers want two completely different\
      \ things from the game but thats where I think the UC series was a complete\
      \ success. It catered perfectly to that different audience whilst being original\
      \ and using an existing franchise, similar to gears of war in some respects.\
      \ It could also be one reason why gears isnt on PC same with UC2, I dont think\
      \ it has much to do with the fact both games were made for gamepad play or that\
      \ bringing them to PC would create an uproar of \"dumbed down\" reviews from\
      \ PC gamers.</p>\nTheres nothing keeping PC games and console games from playing\
      \ online together in most titles in my eyes, its just up to developers to think\
      \ creatively on control schemes similar to what nintendo did in a way with the\
      \ wiimote. Ofcoarse they cant make a specialised gaming device for 1 game but\
      \ the industry is working towards refining with things like specialised keyboards\
      \ for fps games or even gamepads which are becoming more refined as things go\
      \ along. Sure consoles are limited to an amount of buttons but as Epic said\
      \ they are probably going to add a weapons menu which rolls out a BF2 like thing\
      \ so people can select, similar in some respects to the mouse wheel. Its these\
      \ kinds of solutions which will make cross platform gaming possible and if anyone\
      \ could do it I think Epic could, they have experience with making both console\
      \ and PC titles and know what works best on each control scheme, the trick of\
      \ it would be not to compromise on gameplay to deliver a quicker tried and true\
      \ formula but to design a formula which would work across all control schemes\
      \ equally well</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>So once you take the\
      \ controller out of the way you still have to deal with the attitude of gamers\
      \ which mostly stems from industry politics or pop gaming culture and not general\
      \ personal opinion. While Im not a huge fan of consoles since they started taking\
      \ a larger market share in games then PC, I dont hate consoles or console players.\
      \ My main problem is with the short sighted money grubbing companies who come\
      \ in and treat gaming like the mobile phone ringtone business, they only want\
      \ to pull a quick buck and make their product \"the one and only\" to buy. Which\
      \ is a narrow view of gaming and its only going to get worse before it gets\
      \ better, own a PC? Still waiting for Halo2, well theres long term planning\
      \ for you shaft PC gamers so you can get more people buying your console.</p>\n\
      <p>Anyways consoles are becoming more and more PC like everyday which makes\
      \ you wonder if there wont be a need for them anymore once PC's reach a certain\
      \ stage. Sure its all this 1 system requirement thing but when you look at the\
      \ market there is like 3-4 CPU makers and just 2 graphics card makers atm there\
      \ are others but they dont venture out of their area's enough and some pretty\
      \ much got killed in the power struggle (think 3dfx). So while the industry\
      \ is big its also very small and even if you give your money to MS or Sony your\
      \ still giving money to Ati or Nvidia think about that, same deal as PC right?</p>\n\
      <p>Then theres always Epic right, a company known for making solid engines and\
      \ great games one of the staples of the games industry. Ofcoarse they arnt the\
      \ only one but because of Epics ability to juggle MS, Sony and PC and release\
      \ games across them all I'll stick with them for the moment. This stuff is really\
      \ stunting Epic's abilities to provide a platform independant solution with\
      \ cross platform play I mean exclusivity is one thing but think of what epic\
      \ and all those people using their engine could do if there was more, if they\
      \ wernt held back by all this stuff. I can only imagine it would be something\
      \ of a gaming utopia, not just for epic but all developers with the same ideals,\
      \ plenty of companies do cross platform releases but the ability to play across\
      \ the border just isnt there.</p>\n<p>Controls and gameplay balance are unfortunately\
      \ small poatotes compared to the current state of the industry, specifically\
      \ consoles, see PC and Mac's have had a rivalry longer then Sony vs Nintendo\
      \ or MS vs Sony yet the ability to play across the OS's is there its the same\
      \ with linux and MS doesnt have a huge problem there. All of a sudden theres\
      \ all this proprietary gaming systems to enforce someones rules so they can\
      \ draw more money, but wheres the money for the developers hey they put in all\
      \ this time and effort into actually making games (not cut down PC's) and they\
      \ get bugger all in return. Honestly it annoys me to no end, I think developers\
      \ deserve alot more support, so do publishers though I mean they dont mind cross\
      \ platforms (unless its MS or Sony... again) so whats their problem why all\
      \ of a sudden is this wall built between platforms. If east and west germany\
      \ can get over it why cant Sony and MS? I say let the people decide, lets knock\
      \ over the wall between Platforms and cross that border together&#160;:)</p>\n\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Well after the closure\
      \ of UT2007world, I had this little rant over at UC2004's official forum, I\
      \ figured I'd stick it hear so you guys can learn alittle about me and what\
      \ I think. Its kinda just about general games industry and Epic, because of\
      \ the lack of UT2007 info I got alittle bored so I went off on this rant&#160;:p</p>\n\
      <p>Yeah info on UT2007 is getting thin now the game shows are over and its getting\
      \ close to the end of the year. Really though all ut sites are taking hits,\
      \ they really gotta stick it out because they'll be ready when UT2007 does hit.\
      \ Anyone thinking UT2007 isnt going to be one of the biggest if not the biggest\
      \ online game in a long while is crazy I tell ya. I think thats why epic is\
      \ being so tight lipped, they want back to former glory, yeah its all gears\
      \ talk atm but thats not a pre-existing franchise with a built in fanbase.</p>\n\
      <p>I just know people are going to underrate this game and its going to come\
      \ from nowhere to bite people on the arse, I mean seriously the engine itself\
      \ covers almost every genre, infact I think it does. Gears = TP, Mass Effect/Huxley=MMORPG,\
      \ Halowars=RTS (remember Ensemble got a UE3 liscence not long ago), UT2007=FP\
      \ and I think even MK might be using a modified version but I cant be sure.\
      \ I really think the industry is in for a big shock (a bio one ) when the brunt\
      \ of the UE3 games start hitting the market, gears is just the appetiser until\
      \ the really shit starts to hit the fan. Epic is going to be looking huge once\
      \ all this fiasco is over and done with, games like BF2142, Crysis, Fear and\
      \ Halflife 2 are going to be in one bloody big shadow and they'll find it hard\
      \ to escape. Mwhahahaha</p>\n<p>Not to mention the massive built in mod community\
      \ for UE, some people stuck with UT because it was the game of thier choice\
      \ but seriously the only mods that will stick to UE2.5 for more then the transitional\
      \ period will stay because of the lower system requirements (not that you cant\
      \ undercut Epic's UT2007 on these) UE3 sounds like it has alot of improvements\
      \ to the codebase, things like the better particle editor and kismet are making\
      \ it more attractive then ever. The support for 3dsmax and maya are top notch\
      \ and with those supporting each other more and more now autodesk it head on\
      \ both things are really only looking up for interoptability. XML is making\
      \ leaps and bounds for games by providing some sick slick ways to work with\
      \ data and databases, alot of RTS are going this way adopting LUA or XMLNS directly.</p>\n\
      <p>UE3 will be the first fully dx9 supporting engine from Epic so thats a huge\
      \ step, UE2 and 2.5 did well will full support for DX8 although alot of the\
      \ newer games might seem sweet, they dont actually fully support dx9 being a\
      \ hybrid of sorts between 9-8/7. There are games coming to the vista environment\
      \ supporting dx10 or dx9 through emulation but once Epic moves over you know\
      \ they will do their best to support dx10 to the fullest instead of a 1st gen\
      \ dx10 support it will be more like their previous engines or upgrades.</p>\n\
      <p>One thing we can expect from UT2007 is steady framerates provided by a superior\
      \ engine, not to mention the scalability of UE3. Epic is definatly in for a\
      \ bright future and having so many liscencee's will give them the time and benifit\
      \ to produce more games for their own engine as well as sink alot of money back\
      \ into UE for version 4. On the other hand you have other games and game engines\
      \ that will be developed in the process, none of which in my eyes will be able\
      \ to keep up with Epic, yeah UT2003 may have been seen as some crazy attempt\
      \ at a sequel with UT2004 being the true predacessor, but really Epic was going\
      \ through a creativly inconsistant period with alittle bit of a sidetrack to\
      \ what is now gears.</p>\n<p>There is a big push towards consoles, really though\
      \ the people who design and make games will always be pc gamers at heart. Since\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Total Conversion Woes (11/09/2006)\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Well Ive been working on uc2004\
      \ for awhile now doing coding and the odd bit of modelling. Its good to be working\
      \ with a great bunch of dedicated people, its slow going but I can really see\
      \ it all start to come together now with assets getting nearer completion or\
      \ completed. We are alittle behind on maps but we have taken steps to make sure\
      \ things will start to get done there. Now to the point of this little rant,\
      \ total conversions omg...</p>\n<p>When I started this code alot of it extended\
      \ off of epics minor classes such as <a href=\"/Legacy:XPawn\" title=\"Legacy:XPawn\"\
      >xPawn</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:XPlayer\" title=\"Legacy:XPlayer\">xPlayer</a>\
      \ but through my long journey I have discovered alot of code in <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealPlayer\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UnrealPlayer\">UnrealPlayer</a> had to be replaced. Since I\
      \ started by replacing <a href=\"/Legacy:XPawn\" title=\"Legacy:XPawn\">xPawn</a>\
      \ I realised early after this may not have been the best move, for compatability\
      \ and my sanity.</p>\n<p>The problem I think is with the fact the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Unreal_Engine\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal Engine\">Unreal Engine</a> has\
      \ undergone so many revisions that certain code you may want to replace resides\
      \ in major classes further up the <a href=\"/Legacy:Class_Tree\" title=\"Legacy:Class\
      \ Tree\">class tree</a>. Also another thing I noticed that certain functions\
      \ in other minor classes call other minor classes from within the brackets.\
      \ Now call me n00b or whatever but I did not intend to make such a endless amount\
      \ of work for myself. I could have easily stuck with the old format and been\
      \ well happy, but no I decided the only way to get what I wanted out of the\
      \ code and to learn more about how it all works was to replace alot of it.</p>\n\
      <p>Now I didnt write all new classes from scratch I'll admit that, I reused\
      \ alot of epics code again in mine but I had to replace and add alot more to\
      \ get what I was looking for. The problem with my reasoning was is that what\
      \ I was looking to do for uc2004 wasnt seen before when alot of the code was\
      \ written. There is some pure genius in all those lines and over 8 years worth\
      \ of work by the people at epic, I have nothing but the upmost respect for those\
      \ guys, they are my hero's really.</p>\n<p>I used to do alot of coding for Quake\
      \ and Quake 3 but I found the concepts alittle out of my reach, Ive come along\
      \ way since those days and Im confident of my ability to code well in <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Unreal_Script\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal Script\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      >Unreal Script</a>. I started <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_Script\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal\
      \ Script\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Unreal Scriptback</a> with <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_Tournament_2003\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Unreal Tournament 2003\">Unreal Tournament 2003</a> although\
      \ I was already interested in the Engine well before then, I just never got\
      \ a handel enough on things to move from mapping and coding for Quake 3 to the\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_Engine\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal Engine\">Unreal Engine</a>.\
      \ Once I heard about <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh\"\
      >Static Meshs</a> I was sold on the next version, I decided to work with the\
      \ Quake engine and keep working on my <a href=\"/Legacy:3D_Studio_Max\" title=\"\
      Legacy:3D Studio Max\">3D Studio Max</a> skills as thats where things were heading.</p>\n\
      <p>Ok so Im regreting the move I made to replace certain major classes, although\
      \ not native, contain alot of the inner workings of <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Unreal\">Unreal</a>. The thing I kinda noticed is the line\
      \ between the Engine and the Game are very blurred in the Source, some things\
      \ you would expect to be in classes futher down the tree arnt and others that\
      \ you would expect to be further up arnt. Take vehicles for eg one of the latter\
      \ additions to the engine, alot of the stuff was placed in exsisting classes\
      \ when it could have easily been added in subclasses (Since Im not looking to\
      \ use vehicles at all with UE2.5 it seit seems strange.) Something else that\
      \ I noticed was the amount of excesses in classes you may want to use part but\
      \ not all of the functionality from, its easy enough to modify stuff from mutators\
      \ for lesser mods, but for a really large scale project that doesnt require\
      \ this said functionality what are they to do?? I could easily put up with a\
      \ few fps loss here and there or perhaps a 1-5 ping difference on a decent connection\
      \ but why all the extras.</p>\n<p>The strange thing is I was recently particpation\
      \ in the Unreal Script section on UTforums and I was told to look at the <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Mychaeel/Modding_Etiquette\" title=\"Legacy:Mychaeel/Modding\
      \ Etiquette\">Mychaeel/Modding Etiquette</a> and this was quoted.</p>\n<p><i>Originally\
      \ Posted by Mychaeel'</i></p>\n<p><i>Don't impose arbitrary restrictions on\
      \ how your mod works. Mutators, for instance, are by design and by default cross-compatible\
      \ to each other; but of course that doesn't mean that it's impossible for you\
      \ to create a mutator that won't play well with others (by subclassing PlayerPawn,\
      \ for instance). If there's an actual need for such a restriction, make it inherently\
      \ obvious. Otherwise, investing time in coding something a less straightforward\
      \ way to achieve the same goal while keeping compatibility is time very well\
      \ spent. An arbitrary restriction mentioned in a FAQ or readme file will just\
      \ shift people's perception of it from \"bug\" to \"known bug,\" nothing else.</i></p>\n\
      <p>Now I didnt read all the article but this in itself was pretty relevant to\
      \ what I am working on and Ive found alot of what I would call hacks and bypasses\
      \ in <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator\" title=\"Legacy:Mutator\">mutators</a> to get\
      \ things to be more compatible. Since Im using <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Mutator\">mutators</a> as an example I'll go on to say that Ive actually\
      \ had to add a hack to stop incompatible mutators showing up, would that be\
      \ making things more compatible or less?</p>\n<p>I guess what I am getting at\
      \ is like my experience with Adrenaline Combo's. I replaced the whole system\
      \ because the mod required alot more depth in this area, that epics code wouldnt\
      \ cover, so I thought it best to replace it rather than try to hack the current\
      \ system making it incompatible either way. Now this to me would be a restriction,\
      \ did I have a choice in the matter? not really, because epics code warranted\
      \ the changes I made this makes it compatible with uc2004's gameplay. This code\
      \ can be extended at anytime although it does share a similar restriction that\
      \ epics did its more easy to bypass.</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Unreal_Championship_2?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal Championship 2 (page does not exist)\"\
      >Unreal Championship 2</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Unreal Tournament 2004\">Unreal Tournament 2004</a> share alot of common\
      \ ground in terms of gameplay I was hoping that I could use subclasses all the\
      \ way, but I found that was virtually impossible with my current level of skill\
      \ and I dont think any amount of mutator like hacks could have saved me from\
      \ having to replace certain classes. Ive implemented many hacks to get things\
      \ to work the way I want as it is and having to replace stuff does make this\
      \ mod almost incompatible with all mutators but in the end to get the functionality\
      \ I wanted I had to do it.</p>\n<p>I have taken every step to make sure anyone\
      \ wanting to extend my code has a much easier time than I have, Im not blaming\
      \ anyone for this but it does make thing difficult. I really understand the\
      \ meaning of <b>total conversion</b> now compared to a mod which might be made\
      \ up of acouple of gametypes and <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator\" title=\"Legacy:Mutator\"\
      >mutators</a>. I can only hope things improve in the next version of the engine\
      \ making it easier for compatiblity, modders should take every step to ensure\
      \ people know what hacks are out there and where certain functionality wont\
      \ work. Being at an intermidate stage in my coding life Ive still got alot to\
      \ learn, theres plenty of information out there for people new to coding in\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_Script\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal Script\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\">Unreal Script</a> but what we really need is people who can share\
      \ there experience and code that are of a higher level. That way we can work\
      \ as a global team to make things work better together and raise the skill of\
      \ the community as a whole.</p>\n<hr />\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time\

    text: "=Rants=\n==Fire Monkey '''(30/04/2010)'''==\n\nSo its 2010 now, alittle\
      \ over 3 years since I last ranted on the wiki, mind you I kinda spurt s*^t\
      \ everywhere so its not hard to miss alittle of my dribble. With that I think\
      \ we'll continue, whats up you ask? Where have I been, why the name change?\
      \ Well its a very long story, one of deceit, treachery, heart break and alot\
      \ of sawed off shotguns and roses (a cigar snipper or two and the odd knee capping\
      \ with base ball bats).\n\nI made it though and now the FBI has finally allowed\
      \ me (now the court case is over) to surface from witness protection. Its been\
      \ a long arduous journey but Im here.\n\nSo first order of business, UC2004,\
      \ its pretty much dead. Sorry guys, if anyone wants to pick it up feel free\
      \ to contact me or any of the other members to discuss taking it off our hands.\
      \ Personally I have modified designs (which inspired by working with UC2004\
      \ and the team) for UT3 which are along the '''championship''' lines but not\
      \ in direct relation to 2kx itself. I do keep in contact with acouple of the\
      \ team members (Crotale, Miko and EzJamin) but we dont talk as much as we used\
      \ to, so big shout out to them (love ya guys).\n\nNext up the name, well I got\
      \ publicly smeared, I wont go into it but basically Im happy under this new\
      \ handle and will continue to use it into the future. For the people close to\
      \ me nothing has changed I will forever be Daniel, Dan (hey jess), Danny (yo\
      \ kat). Now this was alittle bit annoying since I had to go through and change\
      \ alot of things, a few things like these rants stayed under the other alias\
      \ for some time because it was such a large task getting rid of the old name\
      \ (I didnt really realize until after I decided).\n\nI havent actually ever\
      \ gone anywhere, Ive been lurking around, I was without a PC for say 5 months\
      \ last year and battle with wireless broadband bandwith limits currently. Its\
      \ been all fun and games over here, I still keep working though, I'll never\
      \ stop being a modder. Its in my blood it has been ever since that first grenade\
      \ gibbing in quake demo that was the day I knew forsure there was nothing else\
      \ on this planet for me but being a game designer, thats ultimately where I\
      \ want to be.\n\nSo while I do all these programming projects, help to document\
      \ unreal script and unreal engine, its not really what I want to be doing. I\
      \ do it for the benefit of all the young me's out there, the people who were\
      \ like me when I started and need a place to get info, hang out or even rant\
      \ (go figure ;) ). I really am only a hobbyist programmer and dont actually\
      \ ever see myself doing it professionally, I can, but Ive always been better\
      \ at systems, design flows and the like. Documentation actually does interest\
      \ me and I spent ALOT of time writing/typing, I have pages and pages of stuff\
      \ with the projects here being the short short short list, theres just never\
      \ enough time.\n\nNow Im really looking to get [[User:00zX/GameDex_Framework_(UT3)|GameDex]]\
      \ out the way so I can move onto giving [[User:00zX/Project_Silky_(UDK)|Project\
      \ Silky]] the attention it requires, I am looking for people to help me test\
      \ (if they have programming knowledge all the better) but that does have future\
      \ potential as I have designs for modules which extend it further. \n\nI think\
      \ I'll leave it there for now, dont expect it to take another 3 years for the\
      \ next rant, Ive got a few ideas (yeah proper research even) for acouple of\
      \ decent rants. This was mainly a reintroduction/update, so hey guys, Im back\
      \ and Im still enjoying the view from the top of the solar systems largest volcano\
      \ ;)\n\n==Platforms and crossing the border! '''(21/04/2007)'''==\n\nFirst off,\
      \ wow Im surprised I went this long without having a rant on this page lolz.\
      \ Probably too busy ranting on the forums (as usual) and working on the mod\
      \ http://www.uc2004.com/ which is going really well now with some solid gameplay\
      \ starting to surface and some assets looking nice and shiny :p\n\nWell to the\
      \ topic at hand, the future of cross platform multiplayer...\n\nIs there one\
      \ or is this just a pipe dream I hope becomes a reality, since starting UC2004\
      \ I have actually been paying more attention then I should to this topic and\
      \ with it a hot discussion on utforums (http://utforums.epicgames.com/showthread.php?t=565557)\
      \ I cant help but think more about it. Being part of a console (gamepad) game\
      \ port to PC has given me a different perspective on things, now I would like\
      \ to say its a unique view but there are alot of people who agree. This actually\
      \ came as a shock, although Im primarily a PC gamer Im amazed how I end up defending\
      \ consoles on one front then slamming them on another, I guess its all in the\
      \ hopes of a more \"unified\" coalition of gamers instead of the mess the whole\
      \ industry is in not just PC.\n\nSure consoles have better shelf space but someone\
      \ said on beyond unreal that online sales and distribution is where its at anyway\
      \ and with consoles now breaching this barrier they are looking to capitalize\
      \ as much as they can.\n\nPretty unfortunate since PC's loose more and more\
      \ to cutdown PC's (consoles) every year and now Mac is banging on the door good\
      \ and proper, novell's hot on vista's heals with XGL. So its a very interesting\
      \ time in the industry. Now we all know that MS is using shady tactics to keep\
      \ a hold of two markets but from what I see they are spreading themselves very\
      \ thin and making themselves and easy target since they can only strengthen\
      \ 1 front with reinforcements if needed. Im alittle worried though as the industry\
      \ is becoming more and more political with those politics getting in the way\
      \ of \"our\" gaming, its not just those companies though with gamers themselves\
      \ taking sides and defending there prefered platform even if they dont really\
      \ have a problem with any gamer. I myself dont have problems with most people\
      \ even if they are 360 or PS3 owners even though they are both threatening my\
      \ PC gaming with their preference. So what if we took Platform out of the equation\
      \ by making all games available on all major platforms which can support it\
      \ say for eg (mac, linux, windows, 360 and PS3) since the wii has less power\
      \ we'll leave it out but there might be instances where that will fit as well.\
      \ No longer are these people a threat but fellow gamers and we can put our differences\
      \ aside as we can all play together and get the same games so there is no competition\
      \ as such between platform exclusiveness but puts the emphasis on the games\
      \ people want to buy rather then the platform. Exactly where it should be in\
      \ my opinion!\n\nNow this is a quote from utforums which I find relevant to\
      \ this topic and I like how well it comes across so I'll post it here for some\
      \ perspective.\n\n<div class=\"hidden-block\"><span class=\"hint\"></span><div\
      \ class=\"hidden\">\n{{ambox|text=Yeah I dont think shadowrun will be the best\
      \ example in a for cross platform argument especially in UT3's case. The matter\
      \ at hand is they couldnt say oh well 360 gamers can use keyboard and mouse\
      \ they had to say well they are stuck with gamepad no matter what, how can we\
      \ fix this.\n\nIt being a tactical shooter in some sense (others might just\
      \ call this rpg) gave them a chance to say well we can adjust each control setup\
      \ different, now thats what should be done but giving assistance one way or\
      \ the other shouldnt. Thats why I think this is a prime example of things being\
      \ unfair because they are trying too hard to make it fair.\n\nWhat I would like\
      \ to see is more creative solutions to the problem over general assists like\
      \ (autoaim for eg). Things like auto center view are perfect examples of things\
      \ which are suited more to a joystick and not a mouse but doesnt offer anything\
      \ more in that it will make for an uneven playing ground. Its kinda like the\
      \ mousewheel vs direct key selection, no one says oh the mousewheel dumbs things\
      \ down so dont add it in there and people dont go on and on about how using\
      \ the direct key select is unfair. Although I think myself some improvements\
      \ could be made to bring them both into line with each other I dont think either\
      \ is unfair as such.\n\nNow I am alittle sick of this whole oh but it'll \"\
      dumb things down\" debate, that whole term is overused, its actually called\
      \ arcade vs simulation and consoles have a tendency to lean towards arcade gameplay\
      \ over simulations unlike PC's which lean the other way a touch more. Now we\
      \ are talking about an arcade action shooter here so any \"dumbing down\" could\
      \ even benefit gameplay you just never know, as UT is a fairly streamlined game\
      \ compared to tac shooters (or RealiSims as I call them ) an all their buttons\
      \ for various movements I dont see this as a good argument.\n\nI just dont think\
      \ for this game to be cross platform it instantly has to become a console arcade\
      \ game, it could just as easily be done the other way with the PC version directly\
      \ translating to console. With some clever design and input options it could\
      \ level the playing ground for gamepad vs keyboard and mouse on any platform\
      \ (pc vs pc even). Then people can use the control of their choice without having\
      \ to worry about compromise, or one person getting automatic assits to the point\
      \ of it being unfair.\n\nChanging the gameplay to suit a control scheme is just\
      \ a compromise and in effect does nothing for the issue of cross platform compatible\
      \ play (we could even call it cross controller gaming ) what needs to happen\
      \ is solutions which will bring devices inline without giving one any advantage\
      \ and without adjusting the gameplay to suit either method. The fixes need to\
      \ be so general they dont even need to be control scheme specific (where in\
      \ some cases they might like the mousewheel for eg) but things like center view\
      \ which can be automatic or set to a key can be used on basically any setup.\n\
      \nI just feel thats why shadowrun might not work so well is that people will\
      \ see the benefits of all the assists given to one side or the other and start\
      \ screaming \"botter\", they could have easily developed systems more to do\
      \ with controls and less to do with gameplay to deal with the problem but they\
      \ didnt which does show alittle bit of the easy way out we see from developers\
      \ these days.\n\nI do see the different tendencies between gamers and that console\
      \ gamers are the ones more likely to ask for things like third person view in\
      \ UT3, perhaps its a marketing choice that the gamers want two completely different\
      \ things from the game but thats where I think the UC series was a complete\
      \ success. It catered perfectly to that different audience whilst being original\
      \ and using an existing franchise, similar to gears of war in some respects.\
      \ It could also be one reason why gears isnt on PC same with UC2, I dont think\
      \ it has much to do with the fact both games were made for gamepad play or that\
      \ bringing them to PC would create an uproar of \"dumbed down\" reviews from\
      \ PC gamers.\n\nTheres nothing keeping PC games and console games from playing\
      \ online together in most titles in my eyes, its just up to developers to think\
      \ creatively on control schemes similar to what nintendo did in a way with the\
      \ wiimote. Ofcoarse they cant make a specialised gaming device for 1 game but\
      \ the industry is working towards refining with things like specialised keyboards\
      \ for fps games or even gamepads which are becoming more refined as things go\
      \ along. Sure consoles are limited to an amount of buttons but as Epic said\
      \ they are probably going to add a weapons menu which rolls out a BF2 like thing\
      \ so people can select, similar in some respects to the mouse wheel. Its these\
      \ kinds of solutions which will make cross platform gaming possible and if anyone\
      \ could do it I think Epic could, they have experience with making both console\
      \ and PC titles and know what works best on each control scheme, the trick of\
      \ it would be not to compromise on gameplay to deliver a quicker tried and true\
      \ formula but to design a formula which would work across all control schemes\
      \ equally well \n\n}}</div></div>\n\nSo once you take the controller out of\
      \ the way you still have to deal with the attitude of gamers which mostly stems\
      \ from industry politics or pop gaming culture and not general personal opinion.\
      \ While Im not a huge fan of consoles since they started taking a larger market\
      \ share in games then PC, I dont hate consoles or console players. My main problem\
      \ is with the short sighted money grubbing companies who come in and treat gaming\
      \ like the mobile phone ringtone business, they only want to pull a quick buck\
      \ and make their product \"the one and only\" to buy. Which is a narrow view\
      \ of gaming and its only going to get worse before it gets better, own a PC?\
      \ Still waiting for Halo2, well theres long term planning for you shaft PC gamers\
      \ so you can get more people buying your console.\n\nAnyways consoles are becoming\
      \ more and more PC like everyday which makes you wonder if there wont be a need\
      \ for them anymore once PC's reach a certain stage. Sure its all this 1 system\
      \ requirement thing but when you look at the market there is like 3-4 CPU makers\
      \ and just 2 graphics card makers atm there are others but they dont venture\
      \ out of their area's enough and some pretty much got killed in the power struggle\
      \ (think 3dfx). So while the industry is big its also very small and even if\
      \ you give your money to MS or Sony your still giving money to Ati or Nvidia\
      \ think about that, same deal as PC right?\n\nThen theres always Epic right,\
      \ a company known for making solid engines and great games one of the staples\
      \ of the games industry. Ofcoarse they arnt the only one but because of Epics\
      \ ability to juggle MS, Sony and PC and release games across them all I'll stick\
      \ with them for the moment. This stuff is really stunting Epic's abilities to\
      \ provide a platform independant solution with cross platform play I mean exclusivity\
      \ is one thing but think of what epic and all those people using their engine\
      \ could do if there was more, if they wernt held back by all this stuff. I can\
      \ only imagine it would be something of a gaming utopia, not just for epic but\
      \ all developers with the same ideals, plenty of companies do cross platform\
      \ releases but the ability to play across the border just isnt there.\n\nControls\
      \ and gameplay balance are unfortunately small poatotes compared to the current\
      \ state of the industry, specifically consoles, see PC and Mac's have had a\
      \ rivalry longer then Sony vs Nintendo or MS vs Sony yet the ability to play\
      \ across the OS's is there its the same with linux and MS doesnt have a huge\
      \ problem there. All of a sudden theres all this proprietary gaming systems\
      \ to enforce someones rules so they can draw more money, but wheres the money\
      \ for the developers hey they put in all this time and effort into actually\
      \ making games (not cut down PC's) and they get bugger all in return. Honestly\
      \ it annoys me to no end, I think developers deserve alot more support, so do\
      \ publishers though I mean they dont mind cross platforms (unless its MS or\
      \ Sony... again) so whats their problem why all of a sudden is this wall built\
      \ between platforms. If east and west germany can get over it why cant Sony\
      \ and MS? I say let the people decide, lets knock over the wall between Platforms\
      \ and cross that border together :)\n\n==Epic, UE3, UT2007 and the future...\
      \ '''(27/10/2006)'''==\n\nWell after the closure of UT2007world, I had this\
      \ little rant over at UC2004's official forum, I figured I'd stick it hear so\
      \ you guys can learn alittle about me and what I think. Its kinda just about\
      \ general games industry and Epic, because of the lack of UT2007 info I got\
      \ alittle bored so I went off on this rant :p\n\nYeah info on UT2007 is getting\
      \ thin now the game shows are over and its getting close to the end of the year.\
      \ Really though all ut sites are taking hits, they really gotta stick it out\
      \ because they'll be ready when UT2007 does hit. Anyone thinking UT2007 isnt\
      \ going to be one of the biggest if not the biggest online game in a long while\
      \ is crazy I tell ya. I think thats why epic is being so tight lipped, they\
      \ want back to former glory, yeah its all gears talk atm but thats not a pre-existing\
      \ franchise with a built in fanbase.\n\nI just know people are going to underrate\
      \ this game and its going to come from nowhere to bite people on the arse, I\
      \ mean seriously the engine itself covers almost every genre, infact I think\
      \ it does. Gears = TP, Mass Effect/Huxley=MMORPG, Halowars=RTS (remember Ensemble\
      \ got a UE3 liscence not long ago), UT2007=FP and I think even MK might be using\
      \ a modified version but I cant be sure. I really think the industry is in for\
      \ a big shock (a bio one ) when the brunt of the UE3 games start hitting the\
      \ market, gears is just the appetiser until the really shit starts to hit the\
      \ fan. Epic is going to be looking huge once all this fiasco is over and done\
      \ with, games like BF2142, Crysis, Fear and Halflife 2 are going to be in one\
      \ bloody big shadow and they'll find it hard to escape. Mwhahahaha  \n\nNot\
      \ to mention the massive built in mod community for UE, some people stuck with\
      \ UT because it was the game of thier choice but seriously the only mods that\
      \ will stick to UE2.5 for more then the transitional period will stay because\
      \ of the lower system requirements (not that you cant undercut Epic's UT2007\
      \ on these) UE3 sounds like it has alot of improvements to the codebase, things\
      \ like the better particle editor and kismet are making it more attractive then\
      \ ever. The support for 3dsmax and maya are top notch and with those supporting\
      \ each other more and more now autodesk it head on both things are really only\
      \ looking up for interoptability. XML is making leaps and bounds for games by\
      \ providing some sick slick ways to work with data and databases, alot of RTS\
      \ are going this way adopting LUA or XMLNS directly.\n\nUE3 will be the first\
      \ fully dx9 supporting engine from Epic so thats a huge step, UE2 and 2.5 did\
      \ well will full support for DX8 although alot of the newer games might seem\
      \ sweet, they dont actually fully support dx9 being a hybrid of sorts between\
      \ 9-8/7. There are games coming to the vista environment supporting dx10 or\
      \ dx9 through emulation but once Epic moves over you know they will do their\
      \ best to support dx10 to the fullest instead of a 1st gen dx10 support it will\
      \ be more like their previous engines or upgrades.\n\nOne thing we can expect\
      \ from UT2007 is steady framerates provided by a superior engine, not to mention\
      \ the scalability of UE3. Epic is definatly in for a bright future and having\
      \ so many liscencee's will give them the time and benifit to produce more games\
      \ for their own engine as well as sink alot of money back into UE for version\
      \ 4. On the other hand you have other games and game engines that will be developed\
      \ in the process, none of which in my eyes will be able to keep up with Epic,\
      \ yeah UT2003 may have been seen as some crazy attempt at a sequel with UT2004\
      \  being the true predacessor, but really Epic was going through a creativly\
      \ inconsistant period with alittle bit of a sidetrack to what is now gears.\n\
      \nThere is a big push towards consoles, really though the people who design\
      \ and make games will always be pc gamers at heart. Since they are used to create\
      \ games and engines then theres no alternative but to mod on pc's for pc's if\
      \ your looking to get into the industry. \n\n==Total Conversion Woes '''(11/09/2006)'''==\n\
      \nWell Ive been working on uc2004 for awhile now doing coding and the odd bit\
      \ of modelling. Its good to be working with a great bunch of dedicated people,\
      \ its slow going but I can really see it all start to come together now with\
      \ assets getting nearer completion or completed. We are alittle behind on maps\
      \ but we have taken steps to make sure things will start to get done there.\
      \ Now to the point of this little rant, total conversions omg...\n\nWhen I started\
      \ this code alot of it extended off of epics minor classes such as [[Legacy:XPawn|xPawn]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:XPlayer|xPlayer]] but through my long journey I have discovered\
      \ alot of code in [[Legacy:UnrealPlayer|UnrealPlayer]] had to be replaced. Since\
      \ I started by replacing [[Legacy:XPawn|xPawn]] I realised early after this\
      \ may not have been the best move, for compatability and my sanity.\n\nThe problem\
      \ I think is with the fact the [[Legacy:Unreal Engine|Unreal Engine]] has undergone\
      \ so many revisions that certain code you may want to replace resides in major\
      \ classes further up the [[Legacy:Class Tree|class tree]]. Also another thing\
      \ I noticed that certain functions in other minor classes call other minor classes\
      \ from within the brackets. Now call me n00b or whatever but I did not intend\
      \ to make such a endless amount of work for myself. I could have easily stuck\
      \ with the old format and been well happy, but no I decided the only way to\
      \ get what I wanted out of the code and to learn more about how it all works\
      \ was to replace alot of it.\n\nNow I didnt write all new classes from scratch\
      \ I'll admit that, I reused alot of epics code again in mine but I had to replace\
      \ and add alot more to get what I was looking for. The problem with my reasoning\
      \ was is that what I was looking to do for uc2004 wasnt seen before when alot\
      \ of the code was written. There is some pure genius in all those lines and\
      \ over 8 years worth of work by the people at epic, I have nothing but the upmost\
      \ respect for those guys, they are my hero's really.\n\nI used to do alot of\
      \ coding for Quake and Quake 3 but I found the concepts alittle out of my reach,\
      \ Ive come along way since those days and Im confident of my ability to code\
      \ well in [[Legacy:Unreal Script|Unreal Script]]. I started [[Legacy:Unreal\
      \ Script|Unreal Script]]back with [[Legacy:Unreal Tournament 2003|Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003]] although I was already interested in the Engine well before then, I\
      \ just never got a handel enough on things to move from mapping and coding for\
      \ Quake 3 to the [[Legacy:Unreal Engine|Unreal Engine]]. Once I heard about\
      \ [[Legacy:Static Mesh|Static Mesh]]s I was sold on the next version, I decided\
      \ to work with the Quake engine and keep working on my [[Legacy:3D Studio Max|3D\
      \ Studio Max]] skills as thats where things were heading.\n\nOk so Im regreting\
      \ the move I made to replace certain major classes, although not native, contain\
      \ alot of the inner workings of [[Legacy:Unreal|Unreal]]. The thing I kinda\
      \ noticed is the line between the Engine and the Game are very blurred in the\
      \ Source, some things you would expect to be in classes futher down the tree\
      \ arnt and others that you would expect to be further up arnt. Take vehicles\
      \ for eg one of the latter additions to the engine, alot of the stuff was placed\
      \ in exsisting classes when it could have easily been added in subclasses (Since\
      \ Im not looking to use vehicles at all with UE2.5 it seit seems strange.) Something\
      \ else that I noticed was the amount of excesses in classes you may want to\
      \ use part but not all of the functionality from, its easy enough to modify\
      \ stuff from mutators for lesser mods, but for a really large scale project\
      \ that doesnt require this said functionality what are they to do?? I could\
      \ easily put up with a few fps loss here and there or perhaps a 1-5 ping difference\
      \ on a decent connection but why all the extras.\n\nThe strange thing is I was\
      \ recently particpation in the Unreal Script section on UTforums and I was told\
      \ to look at the [[Legacy:Mychaeel/Modding Etiquette|Mychaeel/Modding Etiquette]]\
      \ and this was quoted.\n\n''Originally Posted by Mychaeel'''\n\n''Don't impose\
      \ arbitrary restrictions on how your mod works. Mutators, for instance, are\
      \ by design and by default cross-compatible to each other; but of course that\
      \ doesn't mean that it's impossible for you to create a mutator that won't play\
      \ well with others (by subclassing PlayerPawn, for instance). If there's an\
      \ actual need for such a restriction, make it inherently obvious. Otherwise,\
      \ investing time in coding something a less straightforward way to achieve the\
      \ same goal while keeping compatibility is time very well spent. An arbitrary\
      \ restriction mentioned in a FAQ or readme file will just shift people's perception\
      \ of it from \"bug\" to \"known bug,\" nothing else.''\n\nNow I didnt read all\
      \ the article but this in itself was pretty relevant to what I am working on\
      \ and Ive found alot of what I would call hacks and bypasses in [[Legacy:Mutator|mutator]]s\
      \ to get things to be more compatible. Since Im using [[Legacy:Mutator|mutator]]s\
      \ as an example I'll go on to say that Ive actually had to add a hack to stop\
      \ incompatible mutators showing up, would that be making things more compatible\
      \ or less?\n\nI guess what I am getting at is like my experience with Adrenaline\
      \ Combo's. I replaced the whole system because the mod required alot more depth\
      \ in this area, that epics code wouldnt cover, so I thought it best to replace\
      \ it rather than try to hack the current system making it incompatible either\
      \ way. Now this to me would be a restriction, did I have a choice in the matter?\
      \ not really, because epics code warranted the changes I made this makes it\
      \ compatible with uc2004's gameplay. This code can be extended at anytime although\
      \ it does share a similar restriction that epics did its more easy to bypass.\n\
      \nSince [[Legacy:Unreal Championship 2|Unreal Championship 2]] and [[Legacy:Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2004|Unreal Tournament 2004]] share alot of common ground in terms\
      \ of gameplay I was hoping that I could use subclasses all the way, but I found\
      \ that was virtually impossible with my current level of skill and I dont think\
      \ any amount of mutator like hacks could have saved me from having to replace\
      \ certain classes. Ive implemented many hacks to get things to work the way\
      \ I want as it is and having to replace stuff does make this mod almost incompatible\
      \ with all mutators but in the end to get the functionality I wanted I had to\
      \ do it. \n\nI have taken every step to make sure anyone wanting to extend my\
      \ code has a much easier time than I have, Im not blaming anyone for this but\
      \ it does make thing difficult. I really understand the meaning of '''total\
      \ conversion''' now compared to a mod which might be made up of acouple of gametypes\
      \ and [[Legacy:Mutator|mutator]]s. I can only hope things improve in the next\
      \ version of the engine making it easier for compatiblity, modders should take\
      \ every step to ensure people know what hacks are out there and where certain\
      \ functionality wont work. Being at an intermidate stage in my coding life Ive\
      \ still got alot to learn, theres plenty of information out there for people\
      \ new to coding in [[Legacy:Unreal Script|Unreal Script]] but what we really\
      \ need is people who can share there experience and code that are of a higher\
      \ level. That way we can work as a global team to make things work better together\
      \ and raise the skill of the community as a whole.\n\n----"
