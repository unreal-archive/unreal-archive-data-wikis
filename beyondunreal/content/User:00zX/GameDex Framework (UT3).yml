      \ everything approach, I like to keep things modular and interconnecting, I\
      \ noticed inherent problems with Unreal Engines mutator system (as you all would\
      \ have at one point or another) so I went about starting to hook through it\
      \ and creating a new system which could actually replace the system especially\
      \ now we have the UDK at our disposal.\n<ul>\n<li>The initial ideas and concepts\
      \ from this project came about while I was working on the <b>Newtators</b> mutator\
      \ pack and <b>Attrition</b> gametype, eventually these projects and some of\
      \ the major functionality was rolled into <b>Gamedex</b> as it provided a more\
      \ modular approach and allowed me to reuse alot of said functionality easier.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n</li>\n<li>Since the new system is totally reliant on <a href=\"/UE3:Object_(UT3)\"\
      \ title=\"UE3:Object (UT3)\">Object</a>'s I suspect that its better on system\
      \ performance and will be dealt with by the internal garbage collection system.\
      \ These objects can be initialized at any time and for any number of actors,\
      \ for instance since all damage is hooked through one function one can prune\
      \ the unwanted actors rather than searching for the specific actors you want\
      \ to apply a rule to. The rules are meant to be simple as in the vampire mutator,\
      \ which gives players a portion of the damage they deal back in health. Any\
      \ number of players could be affected by this, for a duration or globally for\
      \ the entire match. Mutators dont really allow this kind of control, they can\
      \ but I believe the front end for interfacing with this system would be much\
      \ more intuitive.</li>\n<li>This is where I hit my first major hurdle as I wanted\
      \ to provide a UI similar to 2k4's for adjusting mutator settings, maybe even\
      \ extending that to allow server admins to interface with the modules on the\
      \ fly whilst connected to their server.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming\"\

      \ of actor classes and into objects</dd>\n<dd>the idea is to be able to build\
      \ a gametype solely out of subobjects</dd>\n<dd>ofcoarse theres bound to be\
      \ incompatibilities with modules but it could allow for more compatibility then\
      \ mutators/gamerules currently offer</dd>\n<dd>as you can hook through pawn/controller\
      \ layer as well as gameinfo</dd>\n<dd>thats where the udk version will go</dd>\n\
      <dd>well it works, theres no issues with networking at the moment hey&#160;:P</dd>\n\
      <dd>all functions are hooked through actors</dd>\n<dd>oh you have no idea, its\
      \ not just compilicated because it reroutes the flow of events but theres a\
      \ whole new stacking system (no more linked list) which will be harder to follow\
      \ then the previous method</dd>\n<dd>theres some pretty tricky mathematics in\
      \ the core classes and database work like factory/item replacement</dd>\n<dd>thats\
      \ just in what Ive got in the core, thats none of the more complex things in\
      \ the pack after the base text package</dd>\n<dd>whats sweet though is say,\
      \ I'll let alittle info out, is that if I were to use my random factory in my\
      \ own project (one where I had full provider sets and auto generation for new\
      \ classes) its very powerful</dd>\n<dd>you can use it for something like parked\
      \ cars in GTA for eg where one time there will be a parked car there thats green,\
      \ next time its a purple hummer, next time theres nothin there</dd>\n<dd>well\
      \ Im getting to the next lot of tests now, Im pretty happy with how solid it\
      \ is atm and its been compiling fine for sometime</dd>\n<dd>Ive actually dropped\
      \ the filesize rather dramatically</dd>\n<dd>see what I can do with this other\
      \ method, whilst I cant save objects I can save a group of classes, create objects\
      \ and pull in their defaults for modification. Maybe add those to a dynamic\
      \ array of each type.</dd>\n<dd>nope cant do that, grrr unrealscript why u have\
      \ to be so limiting to my thought process</dd>\n<dd>i need a better thought\
      \ bubble&#160;:P ((foreach variable in class{ find variable type; add variable\
      \ type to array;} return true;))</dd>\n<dd>~added some dribble, updated core\
      \ modules, starting to look like something, nsis script and installer packaging\
      \ almost final, test suite and beta testing on the way</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><br /></p>\n\

      \ get up to 199 from sucking enemies health.</dd>\n<dd><b>Booster</b> - Replaces\
      \ the Berserk Powerup with a new Booster Powerup. It gives the player health\
      \ every 10 seconds, it raises the health cap to 199/299 and allows you to pickup\
      \ health to reach the cap quicker. Once it has depleted your health will slowly\
      \ drip back to normal levels</dd>\n<dd><b>Dual Enforcers</b> - Gives you dual\
      \ enforcers on spawn.</dd>\n<dd><b>Energy Leech</b> - Leeches a percentage of\
      \ the Shields/Armour from damaged players or vehicles and gives it back to you.\
      \ (UI)</dd>\n<dd><b>Extra Self Damage</b> - Players take more damage from their\
      \ own shots.</dd>\n<dd><b>Fast Weapon Switch</b> - Weapons switch faster.</dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Hardcore</b> - Like UT's Harcore option this raises all damages to 125%\
      \ of their original.</dd>\n<dd><b>Hoarding</b> - Lets you choose which items\
      \ players can pickup and which they cant when they already have the maximum.\
      \ (UI)</dd>\n<dd><b>No Double Jump</b> - Removes double jumping and adds a single\
      \ higher jump, wall dodging is still enabled, also allows you to walk so you\
      \ dont activate the jump boots when single jumping much like UT.</dd>\n<dd><b>No\
      \ Health Pickups</b> - Removes all health pickups from the game.</dd>\n<dd><b>No\
      \ Super Weapons</b> - Removes all super weapons from the game.</dd>\n<dd><b>Quad-Jump\
      \ Boots</b> - Spawns new jump boot pickups which gives the user limit charges\
      \ to perform quad jumps. This allows you to do many jump combinations like wall-dodge-double-jumps.</dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Speed Boots</b> - Spawns speed boot pickups instead of jump boots. When\
      \ picked up these boots increase the players speed dramatically for 30 seconds.</dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Strong Vehicles</b> - Makes all vehicles stronger vs most damage types.\
      \ Vehicles are still similarly damaged from crashes and falls.</dd>\n<dd><b>SuperBots</b>\
      \ - Will make Bots deal more damage to Human players.</dd>\n<dd><b>Translocator</b>\
      \ - Will add the Translocator to Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch.</dd>\n<dd><b>Vampire</b>\
      \ - A percentage of damage done to enemies will be given back to you in health.\
      \ This health is shown on the screen so you know how much you have received.\
      \ This also allows the option for vehicles to take a percentage of damage from\
      \ other vehicles. (UI)</dd>\n<dd><b>Vehicle Replacer</b> - Allows you to choose\
      \ which vehicles to replace and with what. It also has an option for per map\
      \ settings which is accessible from the config files. (UI)</dd>\n<dd><b>Vehicle\
      \ Team Swap</b> - Allows you to set Red/Blue to use Necris/Axon vehicles regardless\
      \ of the map defaults. It also has an option for per map settings which is accessible\
      \ from the config files. (UI)</dd>\n</dl>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      >Attrition-v0.5pb.rar</a><br />\n<br />\n<b>Description:</b> The idea behind\
      \ this gametype was a war of attrition so everything featured is geared towards\
      \ that. To win though you have to make a kill with every weapon once, you start\
      \ with all weapons and they are removed from your inventory as you make a kill\
      \ with them. Suicides will return a weapon back to your inventory unless it\
      \ is already full. There is a catch, you have unlimited ammo and all pickups\
      \ are removed except, Jumpboots, Vials, Armour, Shields and the Keg.</p>\n<p>In\
      \ this gametype frags dont really matter a great deal, except they are a way\
      \ to get rid of your weapons!</p>\n<p>This gametype is best suited for lower\
      \ player counts, around the 2-4 range is really good but anywhere between 2-8\
      \ should make for good matches as it really does depend on the size of the map\
      \ and how many rounds you want to play.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Features:</b><br /></p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd><b>Health/Armour Degen</b> - after these are picked up they start\
      \ to wear in, then over time they wear out and break down. Wear only occurs\
      \ over 100 health and always on armour.</dd>\n<dd><b>Round Based Play</b> -\
      \ at the moment it only supports winning the match by getting to the rounds\
      \ won, so if you win 3 rounds, in any order first, you are the winner. More\
      \ victory conditions are on their way though, like playing out an amount of\
      \ rounds no matter what and the player with the most wins at the end is the\
      \ winner.</dd>\n<dd><b>Anti-Camper</b> - This was put in because of the unlimited\
      \ ammo, keeps people moving and makes the matches faster especially 1 on 1 matches.\
      \ Since there is no time limit this was almost a requirement.</dd>\n<dd><b>Tweaked\
      \ Music</b> - To give more of an action feel the music was tweeked so it ramps\
      \ up alot more.</dd>\n<dd><b>Tweaked HUD</b> - Alot of the excess text was removed\
      \ from the hud as well as tweaking to make it fit with the gametype. I will\
      \ be updating this so people can customize alittle more and reallow acouple\
      \ of the default options.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\n\

      \n===Description===\n*Not being a fan of the one class/mutator does everything\
      \ approach,  I like to keep things modular and interconnecting, I noticed inherent\
      \ problems with Unreal Engines mutator system (as you all would have at one\
      \ point or another) so I went about starting to hook through it and creating\
      \ a new system which could actually replace the system especially now we have\
      \ the UDK at our disposal.\n**The initial ideas and concepts from this project\
      \ came about while I was working on the '''Newtators''' mutator pack and '''Attrition'''\
      \ gametype, eventually these projects and some of the major functionality was\
      \ rolled into '''Gamedex''' as it provided a more modular approach and allowed\
      \ me to reuse alot of said functionality easier.\n*Since the new system is totally\
      \ reliant on [[UE3:Object_(UT3)|Object]]'s I suspect that its better on system\
      \ performance and will be dealt with by the internal garbage collection system.\
      \ These objects can be initialized at any time and for any number of actors,\
      \ for instance since all damage is hooked through one function one can prune\
      \ the unwanted actors rather than searching for the specific actors you want\
      \ to apply a rule to. The rules are meant to be simple as in the vampire mutator,\
      \ which gives players a portion of the damage they deal back in health. Any\
      \ number of players could be affected by this, for a duration or globally for\
      \ the entire match. Mutators dont really allow this kind of control, they can\
      \ but I believe the front end for interfacing with this system would be much\
      \ more intuitive.\n*This is where I hit my first major hurdle as I wanted to\
      \ provide a UI similar to 2k4's for adjusting mutator settings, maybe even extending\
      \ that to allow server admins to interface with the modules on the fly whilst\
      \ connected to their server.\n\n:[[wp:Aspect-oriented_programming|Aspect-Oriented\
      \ Programming]]\n::[[wp:Cross-cutting_concern|Cross-Cutting Concern]]\n:[[wp:Modularity_%28programming%29|Modularity]]\n\
      ::[[wp:Concern_%28computer_science%29|Concern]]\n:[[wp:Component-based_software_engineering|Component-Based\
      \ Software Engineering]]\n::[[wp:Event_driven_architecture|Event Driven Architecture]]\n\
      \n====Future Directions====\n:basically it abstracts game event flow out of\
      \ actor classes and into objects\n:the idea is to be able to build a gametype\
      \ solely out of subobjects\n:ofcoarse theres bound to be incompatibilities with\
      \ modules but it could allow for more compatibility then mutators/gamerules\
      \ currently offer\n:as you can hook through pawn/controller layer as well as\
      \ gameinfo\n:thats where the udk version will go\n:well it works, theres no\
      \ issues with networking at the moment hey :P\n:all functions are hooked through\
      \ actors\n:oh you have no idea, its not just compilicated because it reroutes\
      \ the flow of events but theres a whole new stacking system (no more linked\
      \ list) which will be harder to follow then the previous method\n:theres some\
      \ pretty tricky mathematics in the core classes and database work like factory/item\
      \ replacement\n:thats just in what Ive got in the core, thats none of the more\
      \ complex things in the pack after the base text package\n:whats sweet though\
      \ is say, I'll let alittle info out, is that if I were to use my random factory\
      \ in my own project (one where I had full provider sets and auto generation\
      \ for new classes) its very powerful\n:you can use it for something like parked\
      \ cars in GTA for eg where one time there will be a parked car there thats green,\
      \ next time its a purple hummer, next time theres nothin there\n:well Im getting\
      \ to the next lot of tests now, Im pretty happy with how solid it is atm and\
      \ its been compiling fine for sometime\n:Ive actually dropped the filesize rather\
      \ dramatically\n:see what I can do with this other method, whilst I cant save\
      \ objects I can save a group of classes, create objects and pull in their defaults\
      \ for modification. Maybe add those to a dynamic array of each type.\n:nope\
      \ cant do that, grrr unrealscript why u have to be so limiting to my thought\
      \ process\n:i need a better thought bubble :P ((foreach variable in class{ find\
      \ variable type; add variable type to array;} return true;))\n:~added some dribble,\
      \ updated core modules, starting to look like something, nsis script and installer\
      \ packaging almost final, test suite and beta testing on the way\n<br>\n====Core\
      \ Modules====\n;'''Dummy Module''': This is to display a message for assign\
      \ new '''[[UE3:UT_MDB_GameRules_(UT3)|GameRules]]''' modules.\n;'''Damage Conversion''':\
      \ This modifies damages passed to it by distance and percentages.\n;'''Global\
      \ Damage''': This modifies damage received or taken globally for [[vehicle]]s,\
      \ players, [[bot]]s, etc.\n;'''Info Attachments''': Allows you to add Info controls\
      \ for [[actor]] properties.\n;'''Replacer'''\n:;'''Item Replacer''': This replaces\
      \ an Item (weapon, vehicle, health) with any other Item, this allows per [[map]]\
      \ or global settings.\n:;'''Factory Replacer''': This replaces factories with\
      \ any other [[factory]], this allows per [[map]] or global settings.\n;'''Remover''':\
      \ Will remove any navigation point/s of [[class]] from a map.\n;'''GameRules\
      \ Group''': This allows you to store user preset groups of '''[[UE3:UT_MDB_GameRules_(UT3)|UT_MDB_GameRules]]'''.\
      \ (but not user options for those [[object]]s)\n<br>\n====Naming Convention====\n\
      :The over all name for the project '''Gamedex''' was a play on words, being\
      \ part nod to UnCodex and extension from my Noir Highlighter theme code named\
      \ Redex, which inturn was inspired by Epic/DE's use of Redux in UT2k4.\n::Basically\
      \ I see it as a 3rd full revision, with Newtators and Attrition being the first\
      \ two. Upon closer inspection you'll see it says 'Gamed-ex' :)\n:It actually\
      \ took me awhile to settle on a naming convention for these packages and classes.\
      \ \n:Eventually I settled on appending '''UT_''' as a prefix to designate that\
      \ it was a modification for [[Unreal Tournament 3|UT3]].\n:The '''MDB''' is\
      \ just an acronym to set the project apart incase I ever have other projects\
      \ where I have similar named classes. \n:: The beauty of using an acronym for\
      \ projects is you can have multiple versions/branches of the same project on\
      \ the same tree without conflicting class names.\n:: Not only that but you can\
      \ also develop classes and diff/merge the results based on the requirements\
      \ for such projects.\n:: As in Epic's base source code all classes have fixed\
      \ names, so while you might be using 1 version of GameRules if that class changes\
      \ you might get errors which cascade.\n:: With this system you can work from\
      \ one class say '''MDB''' as in the example, yet develop another which we'll\
      \ call '''MDA''' all while keepin on the same class tree. \n:The '''UT_GDP'''\
      \ designates any package which requires '''UT_GameDex''' and '''UT_MDB'''.\n\
      <br>\n====Project Package Tree====\n+'''UT_MDB'''- This package contains buffers\
      \ (empty classes to keep the tree clean) and classes which extend UT3's for\
      \ things like bNoDelete=true spawning.\n++'''UT_GameDex''' - Main package containing\
      \ all the base functionality classes.\n+++'''UT_GDP_Newtators''' - Is one of\
      \ my mutator packages.\n+++'''UT_GDP_Mutatoes'''\n<br>\n====Project Class Tree====\n\

      \ [http://www.fileplanet.com/188371/180000/fileinfo/Unreal-Tournament-3---Newtators-v1.9e\
      \ Newtators-v1.9e]<br><br>\n'''Description:''' Well this started out as just\
      \ a way for me to make some stuff that I would have liked in UT3 such as\na\
      \ few remakes of Epic's classic muts included across other UT games, acouple\
      \ were taken from options also.\nIt grew into something much larger, the idea\
      \ has always been to keep the pack as small and tight as I can\nproviding quality\
      \ mutators with compatibility between them all.I ended up adding a few customs\
      \ things after\nI got done with a few of the remakes and things evolved from\
      \ there, alot of stock assets have been reused\nand remixed to create some extended\
      \ gameplay.<br><br>\n'''Mutators:'''<br>\n:'''Agile''' - Adds dodge-jump, wall-dodge-jump\
      \ and removes the delay on jumps, dodges or jumps with smaller falls.\n:'''Bloodlust'''\
      \ - Replaces the UDamage with a Red Vampyric version which allows you to suck\
      \ health from damaged enemies. You are not allowed to pickup health while using\
      \ this powerup but you can get up to 199 from sucking enemies health.\n:'''Booster'''\
      \ - Replaces the Berserk Powerup with a new Booster Powerup. It gives the player\
      \ health every 10 seconds, it raises the health cap to 199/299 and allows you\
      \ to pickup health to reach the cap quicker. Once it has depleted your health\
      \ will slowly drip back to normal levels\n:'''Dual Enforcers''' - Gives you\
      \ dual enforcers on spawn.\n:'''Energy Leech''' - Leeches a percentage of the\
      \ Shields/Armour from damaged players or vehicles and gives it back to you.\
      \ (UI)\n:'''Extra Self Damage''' - Players take more damage from their own shots.\n\
      :'''Fast Weapon Switch''' - Weapons switch faster.\n:'''Hardcore''' - Like UT's\
      \ Harcore option this raises all damages to 125% of their original.\n:'''Hoarding'''\
      \ - Lets you choose which items players can pickup and which they cant when\
      \ they already have the maximum. (UI)\n:'''No Double Jump''' - Removes double\
      \ jumping and adds a single higher jump, wall dodging is still enabled, also\
      \ allows you to walk so you dont activate the jump boots when single jumping\
      \ much like UT.\n:'''No Health Pickups''' - Removes all health pickups from\
      \ the game.\n:'''No Super Weapons''' - Removes all super weapons from the game.\n\
      :'''Quad-Jump Boots''' - Spawns new jump boot pickups which gives the user limit\
      \ charges to perform quad jumps. This allows you to do many jump combinations\
      \ like wall-dodge-double-jumps.\n:'''Speed Boots''' - Spawns speed boot pickups\
      \ instead of jump boots. When picked up these boots increase the players speed\
      \ dramatically for 30 seconds.\n:'''Strong Vehicles''' - Makes all vehicles\
      \ stronger vs most damage types. Vehicles are still similarly damaged from crashes\
      \ and falls.\n:'''SuperBots''' - Will make Bots deal more damage to Human players.\n\
      :'''Translocator''' - Will add the Translocator to Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch.\n\
      :'''Vampire''' - A percentage of damage done to enemies will be given back to\
      \ you in health. This health is shown on the screen so you know how much you\
      \ have received. This also allows the option for vehicles to take a percentage\
      \ of damage from other vehicles. (UI)\n:'''Vehicle Replacer''' - Allows you\
      \ to choose which vehicles to replace and with what. It also has an option for\
      \ per map settings which is accessible from the config files. (UI)\n:'''Vehicle\
      \ Team Swap''' - Allows you to set Red/Blue to use Necris/Axon vehicles regardless\
      \ of the map defaults. It also has an option for per map settings which is accessible\
      \ from the config files. (UI)\n\n====Attrition (Gametype)====\n'''Download:'''\
      \ [http://www.fileplanet.com/188428/180000/fileinfo/Unreal-Tournament-3---Attrition-v0.5pb\
      \ Attrition-v0.5pb.rar]<br><br>\n'''Description:''' The idea behind this gametype\
      \ was a war of attrition so everything featured is geared towards that. To win\
      \ though you have to make a kill with every weapon once, you start with all\
      \ weapons and they are removed from your inventory as you make a kill with them.\
      \ Suicides will return a weapon back to your inventory unless it is already\
      \ full. There is a catch, you have unlimited ammo and all pickups are removed\
      \ except, Jumpboots, Vials, Armour, Shields and the Keg.\n\nIn this gametype\
      \ frags dont really matter a great deal, except they are a way to get rid of\
      \ your weapons!\n\nThis gametype is best suited for lower player counts, around\
      \ the 2-4 range is really good but anywhere between 2-8 should make for good\
      \ matches as it really does depend on the size of the map and how many rounds\
      \ you want to play. \n<br><br>\n'''Features:'''<br>\n:'''Health/Armour Degen'''\
      \ - after these are picked up they start to wear in, then over time they wear\
      \ out and break down. Wear only occurs over 100 health and always on armour.\n\
      :'''Round Based Play''' - at the moment it only supports winning the match by\
      \ getting to the rounds won, so if you win 3 rounds, in any order first, you\
      \ are the winner. More victory conditions are on their way though, like playing\
      \ out an amount of rounds no matter what and the player with the most wins at\
      \ the end is the winner.\n:'''Anti-Camper''' - This was put in because of the\
      \ unlimited ammo, keeps people moving and makes the matches faster especially\
      \ 1 on 1 matches. Since there is no time limit this was almost a requirement.\n\
      :'''Tweaked Music''' - To give more of an action feel the music was tweeked\
      \ so it ramps up alot more.\n:'''Tweaked HUD''' - Alot of the excess text was\
      \ removed from the hud as well as tweaking to make it fit with the gametype.\
      \ I will be updating this so people can customize alittle more and reallow acouple\
      \ of the default options. \n<br>"
