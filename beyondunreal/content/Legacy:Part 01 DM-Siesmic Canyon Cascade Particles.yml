    text: "<p><i>ToDo: Add more images of the Cascade particle emitter browser, showing\
      \ the steps described in this section.</i></p>\n<p>First thing I need to do\
      \ is make the particle material. I use the setup shown in <b>Tiles #01 and #02</b></p>\n\
      <p>I gave all the rotators different speeds, ranging for about 15 to 25, some\
      \ of them I made negative to increase the turbulance. Everything else I left\
      \ at default values. <i>Note: the textures are using the channels independantly,\
      \ the first texturesample connects using the red channel, the second the green,\
      \ and the third is connected to the blue.</i></p>\n<p>By adding these 3 values\
      \ and dividing to get the average I combine them to produce a swirling nebulous\
      \ looing particle, the shade of grey is also independant to the transparency\
      \ of the sprite, and the rotator values for each color channel should be set\
      \ to quite different speeds.</p>\n<p>After connection the 1st block to the emmisive\
      \ channel, and the second to the opacity, I click the main block (where te other\
      \ blocks output connects too) and change the global properties of the material.</p>\n\
      <p>BlendMode should be BLEND_Additive, so that the combined textures are added\
      \ together.</p>\n<p>LightingModel should be set to MLM_Unlit.</p>\n<p>The particle\
      \ is done, I click the left most green tick at the top, then close the material\
      \ editor.</p>\n<p>Next you can either right-click in the preview panel, or go\
      \ through the File menu to make a new <i>ParticleSystem</i>, after a few seconds\
      \ cascade should open, if it doesn't double click the new ParticleSystem you\
      \ have just made to open the editor.</p>\n<p>In the pannel on the top right,\
      \ Right-Click and add a new <i>ParticleSpriteEmmiter</i>.</p>\n<p>Making sure\
      \ the Particle Emmiter is selected in the top right, go down to the bottom and\
      \ left and change the following properties...</p>\n<p>RequiredModule -&gt; bUseLocalSpace\

      \ Max -&gt; X <i>to 8</i></p>\n<p>StartVelocity -&gt; Distrbution -&gt; Max\

      <p>In the top right you will now need to right-click directly below the list\
      \ item in the list and add '<i>Location -&gt; Initial Location</i>, this will\
      \ allow us to determine where the objects will spawn, I have used the following\
      \ values in the bottom left...</p>\n<p>StartLocation -&gt; Disxtribution -&gt;\
      \ Max -&gt; X <i>to 2</i></p>\n<p>StartLocation -&gt; Disxtribution -&gt; Max\

      <p>To make the fog fade out, we need to add a <b>Color -&gt; Color Over Life</b>\
      \ to the list in the top left. You will then need to look for a button on the\
      \ new <b>Color Over Life</b> tab, it looks like a green squigly line, and is\
      \ on the top most right hand side of the tab. this will add a graph in the bottom\
      \ right.</p>\n<p>Going over to the bottom left section of the screen, you will\
      \ see a little blue triangle pointing down on the farthest most right hand side\
      \ of <b>ColorOverLife -&gt; Distribution</b>, left click this and select <b>DistributionVectorConstantCurve</b>.</p>\n\
      <p>On the right where the graph is, hide the color graph by removing the yellow\
      \ dot on the right of the tab named ColorOverLife, and ensure that the AlphaOverLife\
      \ has a dot on the right hand side. Then using right click on the almost purple\
      \ line, add a node, and move it to about 0.1,0, so that the particles start\
      \ their alpha at about 0.25, add another node, and move it to 1,0, so that by\
      \ the time the particle has reached the end of it's life it's alpha equals 0\
      \ or totally invisible.</p>\n<p>Another tab needs to be added to the top right\
      \ called <b>Size -&gt; Size By Life</b>, add it's graph by clicking the squigly\
      \ line on the right, in the bottom left some properties need to be changed...</p>\n\
      <p>LifeMultiplier -&gt; Distribution -&gt; ConstantCurve -&gt; LockedAxes <i>to\
      \ EDVLF_XYZ</i></p>\n<p>With the LifeMultiplier -&gt; Distribution, click the\
      \ blue triangle pointing down and select <b>DistributionVectorConstantCurve</b>,\
      \ and on the bottom right pannel, where the graphs are make sure the only thing\
      \ visible is the LifeMultiplier graph, by ensuring it is the only one with a\
      \ yellow dot in the right side of it.</p>\n<p>Add a node on the graph, and move\
      \ it to around 0.1,0 - then add another and move it to 1,1 - this will make\
      \ the steam start at off with a 0.1 multiplier, gradually rising to 1.0, making\

      \ the particle material. I use the setup shown in '''Tiles #01 and #02'''\n\n\
      I gave all the rotators different speeds, ranging for about 15 to 25, some of\

      \ and the third is connected to the blue.''\n\nBy adding these 3 values and\

      \ looing particle, the shade of grey is also independant to the transparency\
      \ of the sprite, and the rotator values for each color channel should be set\
      \ to quite different speeds.\n\nAfter connection the 1st block to the emmisive\
      \ channel, and the second to the opacity, I click the main block (where te other\
      \ blocks output connects too) and change the global properties of the material.\n\
      \nBlendMode should be BLEND_Additive, so that the combined textures are added\
      \ together.\n\nLightingModel should be set to MLM_Unlit.\n\nThe particle is\
      \ done, I click the left most green tick at the top, then close the material\
      \ editor.\n\nNext you can either right-click in the preview panel, or go through\
      \ the File menu to make a new ''ParticleSystem'', after a few seconds cascade\
      \ should open, if it doesn't double click the new ParticleSystem you have just\
      \ made to open the editor.\n\nIn the pannel on the top right, Right-Click and\
      \ add a new ''ParticleSpriteEmmiter''.\n\nMaking sure the Particle Emmiter is\
      \ selected in the top right, go down to the bottom and left and change the following\
      \ properties...\n\nRequiredModule -> bUseLocalSpace ''to Checked''\n\nRequiredModule\
      \ -> SpawnRate -> Constant ''to about 25''\n\nIn the top right select the LifeTime\
      \ tab, and change these properties...\n\nLifetime -> Distribution -> Min ''to\
      \ 2.5''\n\nLifetime -> Distribution -> Max ''to 3.0''\n\nThe next tab in the\
      \ top right is Initial Size, select it and change the following...\n\nStartSize\
      \ -> Distrbution -> Max -> X ''to 256''\n\nStartSize -> Distrbution -> Max ->\
      \ Y ''to 256''\n\nStartSize -> Distrbution -> Max -> Z ''to 256''\n\nStartSize\

      \ Y ''to 224''\n\nStartSize -> Distrbution -> Min -> Z ''to 224''\n\nFor Initial\
      \ Velocity in the top right, change the following in the bottom left...\n\n\
      StartVelocity -> Distrbution -> Max -> X ''to 8''\n\nStartVelocity -> Distrbution\
      \ -> Max -> Y ''to 8''\n\nStartVelocity -> Distrbution -> Max -> Z ''to 160''\n\

      \ -> Max -> Y ''to -8''\n\nStartVelocity -> Distrbution -> Max -> Z ''to 128''\n\
      \nIn the top right you will now need to right-click directly below the list\
      \ item in the list and add '''Location -> Initial Location'', this will allow\
      \ us to determine where the objects will spawn, I have used the following values\
      \ in the bottom left...\n\nStartLocation -> Disxtribution -> Max -> X ''to 2''\n\
      \nStartLocation -> Disxtribution -> Max -> Y ''to 2''\n\nStartLocation -> Disxtribution\

      \nStartLocation -> Disxtribution -> Min -> Y ''to -2''\n\nStartLocation -> Disxtribution\

      \ add it's graph by clicking the squigly line on the right, in the bottom left\
      \ some properties need to be changed...\n\nLifeMultiplier -> Distribution ->\
      \ ConstantCurve -> LockedAxes ''to EDVLF_XYZ''\n\nWith the LifeMultiplier ->\
