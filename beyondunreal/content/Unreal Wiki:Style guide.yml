    text: "<p>The wiki <b>Style Guide</b> is designed to maintain consistency throughout\
      \ the site. Since editors from all over the world make modifications and additions\
      \ to the wiki's articles, it is important for the project to have a uniform\
      \ format and style. This article summarizes our recommended style guidelines,\
      \ that apply to all articles written on the site. Articles that follow these\
      \ guidelines are more likely to be well-received by the rest of the community,\
      \ and will require other editors to spend less time cleaning up the articles.</p>\n\
      <p>The style of <a href=\"/Help:Talk_pages\" title=\"Help:Talk pages\">talk\
      \ pages</a> is less formal than that used for articles. While most of these\
      \ guidelines are still relevant to talk pages, there are several differences\
      \ that are noted as appropriate below.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"\

      \ purpose of the Unreal Wiki is to provide encyclopedia-style content describing\
      \ the Unreal games. All articles should be informative and targeted at the site's\
      \ audience. Information that is only of interest to the writer or to other editors\
      \ should not be included in articles. The article's talk page is the place to\
      \ discuss questions about the article's content or style.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
      mw-headline\" id=\"Attribution_and_dates\">Attribution and dates</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\

      \ and dates\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Do not add any attributions (e.g., \"written by QAPete\") or dates (e.g.,\
      \ \"written on Feb. 14, 2007\") when editing an article. The wiki software already\
      \ maintains an accurate record of all contributions via the history page. Duplicating\
      \ the information within an article will only clutter the article, adding extraneous\
      \ editorial information that is not of interest to readers and degrading the\
      \ article's quality. If you are adding information to a page that comes from\
      \ another source (e.g., moved from another wiki page or based on comments by\
      \ another person), you can provide the source with proper credit by using the\
      \ \"Edit Summary\" field on the edit page.</p>\n<p>Some pages may incorrectly\
      \ contain attribution or dates. Feel free to remove these and note the attribution\
      \ in the summary field of the edit page. That way the information still shows\
      \ up in the history tab.</p>\n<p>This rule does <i>not</i> apply to talk pages.\
      \ On talk pages (discussion pages) you <i>should</i> use attribution to clarify\
      \ the flow of discussion; simply typing ~~~~ after your message will automatically\
      \ insert your name and a timestamp.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\
      Redundancy\">Redundancy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Unreal_Wiki:Style_guide?section=3\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Redundancy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>New information added to the wiki should not repeat\
      \ or be redundant with other information already on the site. Adding content\
      \ to the wiki is only useful if the content is organized and presented in a\
      \ way that makes it easy for all readers to find the information. This means\
      \ that generally a topic will have a <b>single</b> page (or a section of a page)\
      \ where the topic is discussed in full detail. Other pages that discuss that\
      \ topic should <b>not</b> try to repeat the details, but should instead provide\
      \ a <a href=\"/Help:Links\" title=\"Help:Links\">link</a> to the page with the\
      \ details. Only information that is directly relevant to a given page should\
      \ be included on the page.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why redundancy\
      \ should be avoided. First, if a topic is discussed in detail on multiple different\
      \ pages, then a reader has to read all of those pages to be sure that he has\
      \ read all the information. Especially on a wiki, where different editors add\
      \ information at different times, multiple versions of the same information\
      \ cannot be efficiently maintained. <a href=\"/Help:Templates#Transclusions\"\
      \ title=\"Help:Templates\">Transclusions</a> should be used instead of copying\
      \ in cases where the same information needs to be shown on multiple pages. Second,\
      \ adding extraneous details makes a page long and difficult to read. Only information\
      \ of interest to almost all readers should be included: 90% of the readers should\
      \ not have to wade through uninteresting information just so that 10% of readers\
      \ can find the information.</p>\n<p>Before adding a new note to a page, editors\
      \ should double check whether:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The information is being added\
      \ to the right page. Is this information directly relevant to the page? Is this\
      \ where readers are likely to look for the information? If the answer to either\
      \ of these questions is \"no\" then add a link to the appropriate page instead.</li>\n\
      <li>The information being added in the right section of the page. The \"Notes\"\
      \ section of a page is only for miscellaneous information that does not fit\
      \ anywhere else, and should not be used if there is another section of the page\
      \ that discusses the topic.</li>\n<li>The information should be merged into\
      \ another, existing paragraph or note. It is generally better to add a few words\
      \ to an existing sentence than to write a whole new note that mostly repeats\
      \ existing information. Don't be afraid to revise what someone else has written:\
      \ wiki editors are supposed to modify content written by other editors.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Unknown_information\">Unknown information</span><span\

      \ information\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>It is acceptable to write an article even if you do not know all of the information\
      \ necessary to complete the article. However, gaps in the article should <i>not</i>\
      \ be filled in with with approximations or best guesses. It is better to have\
      \ no information than to have inaccurate information, because inaccuracies mislead\
      \ readers and are hard to find and correct. Uncertain information, or points\
      \ that need more follow-up, should be marked with {{<a href=\"/edit/Template:Verify?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Template:Verify (page does not exist)\">verify</a>}}\
      \ or moved to the discussion page where other editors can add their knowledge.\
      \ If information is simply missing, the {{<a href=\"/Template:Expand\" title=\"\
      Template:Expand\">expand</a>}} tag should be added to that section.</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ particular following grammar and spelling standards appropriate for printed\
      \ text. Colloquialisms, slang, l33t speak, and other informal or casual styles\
      \ are <b>not</b> acceptable. We want the wiki to be a serious resource for people\
      \ looking for information.</p>\n<p>Words should be spelled using the American\
      \ English spelling, except for terminology and proper nouns that originate from\
      \ the Unreal series games; game-specific words should always use the in-game\
      \ spelling. Similarly, capitalization follows standard English rules, except\
      \ in cases where a proper name or title comes from an Unreal series game, in\
      \ which case the game capitalization is kept (e.g. <a href=\"/UnrealEd\" title=\"\
      UnrealEd\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UnrealEd</a>).</p>\n<p>Numbers should generally\
      \ be written out as words if they are used as part of a sentence and can be\
      \ written out in one or two words. For statistics and tables, however, it is\
      \ proper for the numbers to always be in numerical form.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Unreal Wiki content should be written in a style appropriate\
      \ for an encyclopedia. Descriptions should be clear, concise, and authoritative;\
      \ speculations or uncertain facts should be avoided unless notated. Articles\
      \ should be written for the wiki's readers, and should attempt to tell the readers\
      \ what to expect when they play the game. Instruct and explain to the readers,\
      \ and let the encyclopedia center around them.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: No first person\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes made by well-intentioned\
      \ editors is to provide information using a first-person point of view. First-person\
      \ descriptions are typically used when an editor shares an example of something\
      \ that happened to them in-game to further illustrate or clarify a point. An\
      \ example of first-person narration is \"When I entered the area I saw two titans\"\
      . This writing style implies that the events only happened a single time (when\
      \ the editor was playing the game), and therefore does not provide the reader\
      \ with a meaningful description of what the reader should expect when he plays\
      \ the game. Content submitted to an article in first-person will often be deleted\
      \ and moved to the article's talk page until someone can verify the information\
      \ and rewrite it.</p>\n<p>Instead of first-person descriptions, wiki contributions\
      \ should use second-person or third-person. An example of second-person is \"\
      When you enter the area you will see two titans\". This style talks directly\
      \ to the reader. Although less formal than third-person, second-person descriptions\
      \ can often be easier to write. This sentence in third-person would be \"When\
      \ the player enters the area he will see two titans\".</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ Creating too many links can distract the reader and make the article hard\

      \ the link is of interest. Be sure that any link you add will help readers and\
      \ be used by readers. You should avoid creating duplicate links in an article.\
      \ A link can be repeated if it last appeared in a previous section (since many\

  wikitext:
    text: "The wiki '''Style Guide''' is designed to maintain consistency throughout\
      \ the site.  Since editors from all over the world make modifications and additions\
      \ to the wiki's articles, it is important for the project to have a uniform\
      \ format and style.  This article summarizes our recommended style guidelines,\
      \ that apply to all articles written on the site.  Articles that follow these\
      \ guidelines are more likely to be well-received by the rest of the community,\
      \ and will require other editors to spend less time cleaning up the articles.\n\
      \nThe style of [[Help:Talk pages|talk pages]] is less formal than that used\
      \ for articles.  While most of these guidelines are still relevant to talk pages,\
      \ there are several differences that are noted as appropriate below.\n\n==Content==\n\
      The purpose of the {{SITENAME}} is to provide encyclopedia-style content describing\
      \ the Unreal games.  All articles should be informative and targeted at the\
      \ site's audience.  Information that is only of interest to the writer or to\
      \ other editors should not be included in articles.  The article's talk page\
      \ is the place to discuss questions about the article's content or style.\n\n\
      ===Attribution and dates===\nDo not add any attributions (e.g., \"written by\
      \ QAPete\") or dates (e.g., \"written on Feb. 14, 2007\") when editing an article.\
      \  The wiki software already maintains an accurate record of all contributions\
      \ via the history page.  Duplicating the information within an article will\
      \ only clutter the article, adding extraneous editorial information that is\
      \ not of interest to readers and degrading the article's quality.  If you are\
      \ adding information to a page that comes from another source (e.g., moved from\
      \ another wiki page or based on comments by another person), you can provide\
      \ the source with proper credit by using the \"Edit Summary\" field on the edit\
      \ page.\n\nSome pages may incorrectly contain attribution or dates. Feel free\
      \ to remove these and note the attribution in the summary field of the edit\
      \ page. That way the information still shows up in the history tab. \n\nThis\
      \ rule does ''not'' apply to talk pages.  On talk pages (discussion pages) you\
      \ ''should'' use attribution to clarify the flow of discussion; simply typing\
      \ <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> after your message will automatically insert your name\
      \ and a timestamp. \n\n===Redundancy===\nNew information added to the wiki should\
      \ not repeat or be redundant with other information already on the site.  Adding\
      \ content to the wiki is only useful if the content is organized and presented\
      \ in a way that makes it easy for all readers to find the information.    This\
      \ means that generally a topic will have a '''single''' page (or a section of\
      \ a page) where the topic is discussed in full detail.  Other pages that discuss\
      \ that topic should '''not''' try to repeat the details, but should instead\
      \ provide a [[Help:Links|link]] to the page with the details.  Only information\
      \ that is directly relevant to a given page should be included on the page.\n\
      \nThere are several reasons why redundancy should be avoided.  First, if a topic\
      \ is discussed in detail on multiple different pages, then a reader has to read\
      \ all of those pages to be sure that he has read all the information.  Especially\
      \ on a wiki, where different editors add information at different times, multiple\
      \ versions of the same information cannot be efficiently maintained.  [[Help:Templates#Transclusions|Transclusions]]\
      \ should be used instead of copying in cases where the same information needs\
      \ to be shown on multiple pages.  Second, adding extraneous details makes a\
      \ page long and difficult to read.  Only information of interest to almost all\
      \ readers should be included: 90% of the readers should not have to wade through\
      \ uninteresting information just so that 10% of readers can find the information.\n\
      \nBefore adding a new note to a page, editors should double check whether:\n\
      * The information is being added to the right page. Is this information directly\
      \ relevant to the page?  Is this where readers are likely to look for the information?\
      \  If the answer to either of these questions is \"no\" then add a link to the\
      \ appropriate page instead.\n* The information being added in the right section\
      \ of the page.  The \"Notes\" section of a page is only for miscellaneous information\
      \ that does not fit anywhere else, and should not be used if there is another\
      \ section of the page that discusses the topic.\n* The information should be\
      \ merged into another, existing paragraph or note. It is generally better to\
      \ add a few words to an existing sentence than to write a whole new note that\
      \ mostly repeats existing information.  Don't be afraid to revise what someone\
      \ else has written: wiki editors are supposed to modify content written by other\
      \ editors.\n\n===Unknown information===\nIt is acceptable to write an article\
      \ even if you do not know all of the information necessary to complete the article.\
      \  However, gaps in the article should ''not'' be filled in with with approximations\
      \ or best guesses.  It is better to have no information than to have inaccurate\
      \ information, because inaccuracies mislead readers and are hard to find and\
      \ correct.  Uncertain information, or points that need more follow-up, should\
      \ be marked with {{[[Template:verify|verify]]}} or moved to the discussion page\
      \ where other editors can add their knowledge.  If information is simply missing,\
      \ the {{[[Template:expand|expand]]}} tag should be added to that section.\n\n\
      ==Language==\n{{SITENAME}} is written using American English, in particular\
      \ following grammar and spelling standards appropriate for printed text.  Colloquialisms,\
      \ slang, l33t speak, and other informal or casual styles are '''not''' acceptable.\
      \ We want the wiki to be a serious resource for people looking for information.\n\
      \nWords should be spelled using the American English spelling, except for terminology\
      \ and proper nouns that originate from the Unreal series games; game-specific\
      \ words should always use the in-game spelling.  Similarly, capitalization follows\
      \ standard English rules, except in cases where a proper name or title comes\
      \ from an Unreal series game, in which case the game capitalization is kept\
      \ (e.g. [[UnrealEd]]).\n\nNumbers should generally be written out as words if\
      \ they are used as part of a sentence and can be written out in one or two words.\
      \ For statistics and tables, however, it is proper for the numbers to always\
      \ be in numerical form.\n\n==Writing style==\n{{SITENAME}} content should be\
      \ written in a style appropriate for an encyclopedia.  Descriptions should be\
      \ clear, concise, and authoritative; speculations or uncertain facts should\
      \ be avoided unless notated.  Articles should be written for the wiki's readers,\
      \ and should attempt to tell the readers what to expect when they play the game.\
      \  Instruct and explain to the readers, and let the encyclopedia center around\
      \ them.\n\n===No first person===\nOne of the most common mistakes made by well-intentioned\
      \ editors is to provide information using a first-person point of view.  First-person\
      \ descriptions are typically used when an editor shares an example of something\
      \ that happened to them in-game to further illustrate or clarify a point.  An\
      \ example of first-person narration is \"When I entered the area I saw two titans\"\
      .  This writing style implies that the events only happened a single time (when\
      \ the editor was playing the game), and therefore does not provide the reader\
      \ with a meaningful description of what the reader should expect when he plays\
      \ the game.  Content submitted to an article in first-person will often be deleted\
      \ and moved to the article's talk page until someone can verify the information\
      \ and rewrite it.\n\nInstead of first-person descriptions, wiki contributions\
      \ should use second-person or third-person.  An example of second-person is\
      \ \"When you enter the area you will see two titans\".  This style talks directly\
      \ to the reader.  Although less formal than third-person, second-person descriptions\
      \ can often be easier to write.  This sentence in third-person would be \"When\
      \ the player enters the area he will see two titans\". \n\n==Format==\nWiki\
      \ formatting is used to improve the legibility of an article. Bulleted lists,\
      \ numeric lists, bolding, italics, and coloring are all tools to help text \"\
      pop out\" at the reader.  When properly used, these tools help the reader to\
      \ quickly scan a page for the key points, then focus on individual paragraphs\
      \ of interest. For general guidelines on how to make articles legible, see [http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html\
      \ \"How Users Read on the Web\"] by ''Jakob Nielsen''.\n\nGeneral information\
      \ on how to implement wiki formatting is provided at [[Help:Formatting|Formatting]].\n\
      \n===Bold===\n* Bolding should be used for headings, subheadings, and article\
      \ names.  This is done automatically when using the wiki heading format (e.g.,\
      \ ==heading==).\n* Bold the article name the first time it appears in the page's\
      \ introductory sentence.  Any alternative names in the introductory sentence\
      \ should also be bolded. (e.g. \"'''Vandora''', also known as '''Pandora''',\
      \ is best known for being one of the Nali gods.\")\n* Bold the word or phrase\
      \ being defined in bulleted or numeric lists.\n* Keywords for which readers\
      \ are likely to be scanning may be in bold for emphasis, but this should be\
      \ used sparingly.  \n* Avoid using bold formatting for general emphasis.\n\n\
      ===Italics===\n* Italics should be used for the titles of books and lengthy\
      \ works.\n* Italics can be used for proper names (e.g., of places or items)\
      \ to clarify that the phrase is a proper name.\n* Italics can be used for general\
      \ emphasis, but should be used sparingly.\n\n===Emphasis===\n* Avoid using ALL\
      \ CAPS for emphasis.\n* Avoid bolding words for general emphasis, unless giving\
      \ crucial notice. (e.g. Do '''not''' install mods from unreputable sources.)\n\
      * Avoid using double emphasis, such as combining italics with quotation marks.\
      \ (e.g. \"''an example of double emphasis''\")\n* Do not over emphasize, as\
      \ each emphasis added will lessen the effect of other emphases and detract from\
      \ the appearance of the article.\n\n===Avoid cluttering links===\nCross links\
      \ between wiki pages are important navigational tools, allowing the reader to\
      \ easily follow up on interesting points and find more detailed information.\
      \  However, it is possible to fill a page with too many links.  More details\
      \ on how to create links and guidelines on their usage are provided on the [[Help:Links|Links]]\
      \ help page.\n\nLinks to other articles should only be created when they are\
      \ relevant to the content, and will be helpful and informative to the reader.\
      \  Creating too many links can distract the reader and make the article hard\
      \ to read; some readers are likely to pause on each link to determine whether\
      \ the link is of interest.  Be sure that any link you add will help readers\
      \ and be used by readers.  You should avoid creating duplicate links in an article.\
      \  A link can be repeated if it last appeared in a previous section (since many\
      \ readers will not read all sections of a page), but there is hardly ever a\
      \ reason to link to the same article more than once in the same section.\n\n\
      Cross-wiki links should be used sparingly, and only when the content of the\
      \ page or information pertaining to the page may be found on another wiki.\n\
