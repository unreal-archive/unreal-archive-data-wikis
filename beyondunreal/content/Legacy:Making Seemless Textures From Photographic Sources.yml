      \ images to illustrate the process, the originals can be seen in <b>Tiles #01\
      \ and #02</b>.</p>\n<p>The first thing I do is make the texture the correct\
      \ size, I load my photo-editing software. There are quite a few options in this\
      \ step, from <i>Bicubic Resizes</i> to <i>Cropping</i>, I went with a resize,\
      \ to achieve a height of 2048 pixels, and then cropped the image, while retaining\
      \ its <i>X-Y</i> proportions so that there was no distorting, you can see the\
      \ results in <b>Tiles #03 and #04</b></p>\n<p>I then save this, and open it\
      \ in Texture Maker, I have shown on previous occasions how to use the resampler\
      \ to resample textures, but with these textures too much detail is lost in the\
      \ process, insted, this time I go to the function selection and choose the <b>Make\
      \ Seemless</b> option, my preference is the <b>Circle Blend</b>, though you\
      \ may like to experiment with some of the other options here, I process both\
      \ the textures this way resulting in <b>Tiles #05 and #06</b></p>\n<p><b>Tile\
      \ #05</b> Looks ok to me, and I think this will work in game, while looking\
      \ at it closely you can see the blend, I think that it shouldn't show up to\
      \ much in game, in <b>Tile #06</b> however, the blending is readily apparent,\
      \ and this will need to be touched up in an image editing program that has some\
      \ form of <i>clone-stamp</i>.</p>\n<p>Essentially these textures are done and\
      \ ready for seemless tiling, but to capture the feel of their essence - one\
      \ more step remains before bringing them into the <i>Material Editor</i>.</p>\n\
      <p>For the sake of making this easier on myself, I am only going to continue\
      \ the rest of this example using the image shown in <b>Tile #05</b>.</p>\n<p>I\
      \ startup the CrazyBump Application, and open my image as a photograph, a momentary\
      \ pause later I am at the screen shown in <b>Tile #07</b>. This screen llows\
      \ you to choose if the brighter pixels are going to be higher or lower than\
      \ the darker ones, like in this example if I want the roots to be raised or\
      \ depressed over/into the soil, the image on the left shows the root raised,\
      \ it is the one I want.</p>\n<p>After selecting that, the next screen comes\
      \ up as shown in <b>Tile #08</b>. I am not going to go into too much detail\
      \ as to how the controls of CrazyBump work, and simply state that to the best\
      \ of my knowledge, all the maps with the exception of the occlusion maps can\
      \ be used in UT3 (maybe even the occlusion - though I am not certain of how\
      \ - <i>yet</i>).</p>\n<p>So after tweaking these maps through the sliding controls\
      \ till the texture looks the way I want it, I save 4 of the 5 maps, then with\
      \ my photo-editing software I combine the grey scale images into one image,\
      \ each using it's own color channel, in this case I have put the specular on\
      \ the red channel, and the displacement on the green, I could have optionally\
      \ put the occlusion on the blue, but since I am not using it, I left it as solid\
      \ white. (see <b>Tiles #09 through #11</b>).</p>\n<p>I start up the UT3 Editor,\
      \ and import my 3 textures. Then I make a material, in its most simple form\
      \ it should look like as shown in <b>Tile #12</b>, though you can embelish it\
      \ far more than this.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Image_Tiles\"\

      \nFor this example - I will be demonstrating two seperate images to illustrate\
      \ the process, the originals can be seen in '''Tiles #01 and #02'''.\n\nThe\
      \ first thing I do is make the texture the correct size, I load my photo-editing\
      \ software. There are quite a few options in this step, from ''Bicubic Resizes''\
      \ to ''Cropping'', I went with a resize, to achieve a height of 2048 pixels,\
      \ and then cropped the image, while retaining its ''X-Y'' proportions so that\
      \ there was no distorting, you can see the results in '''Tiles #03 and #04'''\n\
      \nI then save this, and open it in Texture Maker, I have shown on previous occasions\
      \ how to use the resampler to resample textures, but with these textures too\
      \ much detail is lost in the process, insted, this time I go to the function\
      \ selection and choose the '''Make Seemless''' option, my preference is the\
      \ '''Circle Blend''', though you may like to experiment with some of the other\
      \ options here, I process both the textures this way resulting in '''Tiles #05\
      \ and #06'''\n\n'''Tile #05''' Looks ok to me, and I think this will work in\
      \ game, while looking at it closely you can see the blend, I think that it shouldn't\
      \ show up to much in game, in '''Tile #06''' however, the blending is readily\
      \ apparent, and this will need to be touched up in an image editing program\
      \ that has some form of ''clone-stamp''.\n\nEssentially these textures are done\
      \ and ready for seemless tiling, but to capture the feel of their essence -\
      \ one more step remains before bringing them into the ''Material Editor''.\n\
      \nFor the sake of making this easier on myself, I am only going to continue\
      \ the rest of this example using the image shown in '''Tile #05'''.\n\nI startup\
      \ the CrazyBump Application, and open my image as a photograph, a momentary\
      \ pause later I am at the screen shown in '''Tile #07'''. This screen llows\
      \ you to choose if the brighter pixels are going to be higher or lower than\
