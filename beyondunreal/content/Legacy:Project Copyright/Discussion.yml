      \ the discussion on <a href=\"/Legacy:Offline_Wiki\" title=\"Legacy:Offline\

      \ by the current page (see older revisions), and our local Wikizens here have\
      \ been unambiguously supportive of the thought. At the end of the day it's just\
      \ a temporary copy, like what you're doing all the time with your browser cache.</p>\n\

      \ I find: \"Additionally, you grant Meatball a non-exclusive perpetual royalty-free\

      \ for various reasons, and like most Wikis, intend to ship some 'default' pages\
      \ with it. Can I/do I have permission to base some of the content of these Default\
      \ pages from pages of a similar nature from the Unreal Wiki (Which wouldn't\
      \ surprise me if, in turn, that these didn't come from UseMod or MeatBall or\
      \ somesuch); specifically, most of the text on the following pages (not exactly\
      \ - situtation and spelling/punctuation/grammar but the text will stay mainly\
      \ in form) - the Wiki FAQ page, the Sandbox and the New Users Quick Start page.</p>\n\
      <p>FYI I have not yet decided what license I'm going to have with my Wiki, but\
      \ I expect it will be open-source or public domain.</p>\n<p><b>pgibbs:</b> Also,\

      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> The interwiki icons are just shrunken versions of the site\
      \ logos – feel free to copy them. You're right, the FAQ was inspired by the\
      \ Meatball / Wikiwiki version. The Wiki Markup page is borrowed from Wikipedia.\
      \ The other two were written from scratch for this place. Sure, you can use\
      \ them. What are you coding your wiki in, BTW?</p>\n<p><b>pgibbs:</b> Thanks.\
      \ I'm coding it in PHP as a Postnuke module, as the only Wiki that integrates\
      \ into Postnuke is a very old version of the phpWiki.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><span\

      \ I vote for the Creative Commons license.</p>\n<p><b>elmuerte:</b> I am against\
      \ FreeBSD DL, it is not compatible with the idea of a wiki (and the license\
      \ AS IS, isn't usable, the source is not SGML DocBook). CA by-sa is ok'ish,\
      \ it's sound with the wiki concept. But I prefer a added non-commercial restriction\
      \ and a separate commercial restriction where a certain amount of \"profit\"\
      \ must be \"given back\" to the project. I'm not for GFDL, because of some of\
      \ <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License#Criticism_of_the_GFDL\"\
      >these issues</a>. It would be better to use the GPL.</p>\n<p><b>Haarg:</b>\
      \ The CC by-sa or by-nc-sa seem the most promising to me. I'd personally leave\
      \ out the commercial restrictions, but I'm not really a contributor and my main\
      \ concern is practicality. The current plan is to convert the old content but\
      \ leave it under the existing terms. Redistributing under a different license\
      \ isn't viable given the terms as they are currently set.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b>\
      \ oops, I meant a separate license for commercial use and not \"a separate commercial\
      \ restriction\".</p>\n<p><b>Haarg:</b> Last call for comments on this. I'm still\
      \ leaning toward by-sa. Can you present a case for why commercial use should\
      \ be restricted? Having a license set up where the project would receive a portion\
      \ of the profit doesn't seem very useful, as BU is hosting the site for free.</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte:</b> The idea was that the money would go do BU to \"pay\" for\
      \ the provided service. Nothing is stopping a shady character to sell an (e)book\
      \ which is nothing more than a copy of various UnrealWiki pages. I don't that\
      \ kind of practices is within the \"by the community for the community\" spirit.</p>\n\
      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> I was going to say something along the lines of what El\
      \ Muerte said in his last sentence but didn't know how I would go about saying\
      \ it. I for one do not want anyone taking code/information off of this \"open\
      \ source\" site and have people make money from it when clearly they had no\
      \ part in it.</p>\n<p><b>Haarg:</b> Ok, thanks for the comments. Seems most\
      \ would prefer a license that restricts commercial use. I'm going with the CC\
      \ by-nc-sa license. El Muerte, would you be willing to write up something for\
      \ an additional commercial use license?</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> the exact\
      \ terms about commercial use is going to take some time to properly formulate.\
      \ But for sake of completeness of terms of usage and contribution we should\
      \ at least add a notice that the content will also be covered by a license for\
      \ commercial under a to be determined fee, to be paid to BeyondUnreal in name\
      \ of the UnrealWiki project. Anyway, I'll first work out the notice for users/contributers\
      \ so that that angle is covered. After that we can define the exact terms and\
      \ fee for commercial usage.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage:\

      \ with a fairly lax license.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' While I agree with DJPaul that\
      \ this is a matter that has to be discussed, I had a first glance at the Creative\
      \ Commons license and I must admit I like it.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'm with Mych.\
      \ The \"Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\" license seems fairly close to\
      \ our intentions.\n\n'''DJPaul:''' Hey, hey!  Quit it! :stupid:  My qualm was\
      \ with the issue of ''sublicensing'', not of the actual license.\n\n'''reconn:'''\
      \ Despite the opening line of this page, copyright doesn't need to be obtained.\
      \  In the act of creating something new or &ndash; in this case &ndash; writing\
      \ something, you have the sole right to copy it.  It seems to me the essense\
      \ of the Project Copyright is affirming that the authors retain copyright, but\
      \ that it's forced open.  I want to use Creative Commons as a way to refine\
      \ and emphasize the freedoms granted to the things I write here.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Quite right. I think it was a Grungeism. Gone.\n\n'''DJPaul:''' I'm all confused\
      \ now, i'm out of here.  Bye.\n\n----\n\nFor your considering, I think that\
      \ it's very unlikely you can get away with redistributing the entire site as\
      \ a ZIP or a CD without getting the permission from each and every contributor\
      \ author. At least it's not very ethical. Personally, I'm not very confident\
      \ that I can stretch the provision very far on MeatballWiki. I merely wanted\
      \ to provide some reasonable description of what would happen if MeatballWiki\
      \ had to publish ''particular'' pages as static text, such as a standard like\
      \ MeatBall:ModWiki. &ndash; SunirShah\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' See [[Legacy:Project\
      \ Copyright|Project Copyright]] (unchanged since almost a year ago) &ndash;\
      \ plus, the discussion on [[Legacy:Offline Wiki|Offline Wiki]] has been there\
      \ for a long time before I replaced it by the current page (see older revisions),\
      \ and our local Wikizens here have been unambiguously supportive of the thought.\
      \  At the end of the day it's just a temporary copy, like what you're doing\
      \ all the time with your browser cache.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' In fact, browsing\
      \ [[MeatBall:MeatballWikiCopyright]], I find:  \"Additionally, you grant Meatball\
      \ a non-exclusive perpetual royalty-free universal license to distribute the\
      \ content in its archives, or distribute the content in a compilation of selected\
      \ Meatball content. The redistributed material will be timestamped.\"\n\n----\n\
      \n'''CH3Z:''' Should you have a disclaimer above the edit box on the the edit\
      \ pages to the effect:<br />''Note: You are hereby knowingly adding information\
      \ to a publicly displayed document. Please, be respectfull of the intellectual\
      \ property of others.'' ??\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' There's also a text \"Don't create\
      \ a page just to test whether it works\" and people still do it. &ndash; It\
      \ should be self-evident that copyrighted content requires permission to be\
      \ used anywhere, including the Wiki.  If it's not for somebody I doubt adding\
      \ another note to that effect will change a thing.\n\n'''DJPaul:''' Also sounds\
      \ a bit formal, and might scare would-be contributors off.\n\n----\n\n'''pgibbs:'''\
      \ Hi.  I'm coding my own Wiki for various reasons, and like most Wikis, intend\
      \ to ship some 'default' pages with it.  Can I/do I have permission to base\
      \ some of the content of these Default pages from pages of a similar nature\
      \ from the Unreal Wiki (Which wouldn't surprise me if, in turn, that these didn't\
      \ come from UseMod or MeatBall or somesuch); specifically, most of the text\
      \ on the following pages (not exactly - situtation and spelling/punctuation/grammar\
      \ but the text will stay mainly in form) - the Wiki FAQ page, the Sandbox and\
      \ the New Users Quick Start page.\n\nFYI I have not yet decided what license\
      \ I'm going to have with my Wiki, but I expect it will be open-source or public\
      \ domain.\n\n'''pgibbs:''' Also, could I gain permission to use those nice little\
      \ interwiki link icons?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' The interwiki icons are just shrunken\
      \ versions of the site logos &ndash; feel free to copy them. You're right, the\
      \ FAQ was inspired by the Meatball / Wikiwiki version. The Wiki Markup page\
      \ is borrowed from Wikipedia. The other two were written from scratch for this\
      \ place. Sure, you can use them. What are you coding your wiki in, BTW? \n\n\
      '''pgibbs:''' Thanks.  I'm coding it in PHP as a Postnuke module, as the only\
      \ Wiki that integrates into Postnuke is a very old version of the phpWiki.\n\
      \n----\n\n==Deciding on a definite license==\n\n'''Wormbo:''' We still don't\
      \ have a formal license for our content. In the light of the pending switch\
      \ to MediaWiki we should probably decide on one of the commonly used documentation\
      \ licenses. Some suggestions in no particular order:\n* [[Wikipedia:GNU Free\
      \ Documentation License]], which is also used by Wikipedia\n* one of the [[Wikipedia:Creative\
      \ Commons licenses]], probably the [http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?license_code=by-sa\
      \ by-sa] license, which is also used by BeyondUnreal's Liandri Archives.\n*\
      \ [[Wikipedia:FreeBSD Documentation License]]\n* [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#FreeDocumentationLicenses\
      \ others]\n\nMy personal favorite so far is the [http://creativecommons.org/license/results-one?license_code=by-sa&wiki=true\
      \ Creative commons by-sa license with the wiki symbol].\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I\
      \ vote for the Creative Commons license.\n\n'''elmuerte:''' I am against FreeBSD\
      \ DL, it is not compatible with the idea of a wiki (and the license AS IS, isn't\
      \ usable, the source is not SGML DocBook). CA by-sa is ok'ish, it's sound with\
      \ the wiki concept. But I prefer a added non-commercial restriction and a separate\
      \ commercial restriction where a certain amount of \"profit\" must be \"given\
      \ back\" to the project. I'm not for GFDL, because of some of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License#Criticism_of_the_GFDL\
      \ these issues]. It would be better to use the GPL.\n\n'''Haarg:''' The CC by-sa\
      \ or by-nc-sa seem the most promising to me.  I'd personally leave out the commercial\
      \ restrictions, but I'm not really a contributor and my main concern is practicality.\
      \  The current plan is to convert the old content but leave it under the existing\
      \ terms.  Redistributing under a different license isn't viable given the terms\
      \ as they are currently set.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' oops, I meant a separate license\
      \ for commercial use and not \"a separate commercial restriction\".\n\n'''Haarg:'''\
      \ Last call for comments on this.  I'm still leaning toward by-sa.  Can you\
      \ present a case for why commercial use should be restricted?  Having a license\
      \ set up where the project would receive a portion of the profit doesn't seem\
      \ very useful, as BU is hosting the site for free.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' The idea\
      \ was that the money would go do BU to \"pay\" for the provided service. Nothing\
      \ is stopping a shady character to sell an (e)book which is nothing more than\
      \ a copy of various UnrealWiki pages. I don't that kind of practices is within\
      \ the \"by the community for the community\" spirit.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I was\
      \ going to say something along the lines of what El Muerte said in his last\
      \ sentence but didn't know how I would go about saying it.  I for one do not\
      \ want anyone taking code/information off of this \"open source\" site and have\
      \ people make money from it when clearly they had no part in it.\n\n'''Haarg:'''\
      \ Ok, thanks for the comments.  Seems most would prefer a license that restricts\
      \ commercial use.  I'm going with the CC by-nc-sa license.  El Muerte, would\
      \ you be willing to write up something for an additional commercial use license?\n\
      \n'''El Muerte:''' the exact terms about commercial use is going to take some\
      \ time to properly formulate. But for sake of completeness of terms of usage\
      \ and contribution we should at least add a notice that the content will also\
      \ be covered by a license for commercial under a to be determined fee, to be\
      \ paid to BeyondUnreal in name of the UnrealWiki project. Anyway, I'll first\
      \ work out the notice for users/contributers so that that angle is covered.\
      \ After that we can define the exact terms and fee for commercial usage."
