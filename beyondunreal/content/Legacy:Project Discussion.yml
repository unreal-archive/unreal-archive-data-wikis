      \ What should this project look like?</p>\n<p>The project started covering the\
      \ UScript class tree, as there's an obvious topic hierarchy, whereas with tutes\
      \ the divisons are a bit more blurry. Particularly, the (arbitrary) division\
      \ of tutorials into beginner/intermediate/advanced isn't conducive to finding\
      \ information when the split is over several pages.</p>\n<p>The real mapper\
      \ beginner could be lost in all the knowledge of a complex encyclopedia. Ideas\
      \ (mostly now implemented):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mini 'real' tutorials at the end\
      \ of each section. For example, at the end of the <a href=\"/Legacy:Effects\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Effects\">effects</a> page a little article 'Now follow this\
      \ tutorial to make an exploding wall with smoke'. That's what beginners are\
      \ looking for, and that's the best way to learn.</li>\n<li>example: the page\
      \ on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Mover\" title=\"Legacy:Mover\">Mover</a> class stands\
      \ as a reference document, but a page that explains what a mover is and the\
      \ basics of using it is needed too, for example <a href=\"/Legacy:Create_A_Mover\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Create A Mover\">Create A Mover</a>.</li>\n<li>similar to disambiguation\
      \ pages on Wikipedia: technical pages such as <a href=\"/Legacy:Mover\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Mover\">Mover</a> begin with links to tutorials on the subject. Put either\
      \ a tutorial, or a link to it at the beginning of each page. Then after practice,explain\
      \ the theory. Advanced disciples would just skip the tutorial part.</li>\n</ul>\n\

      >Creating DM-Quadroid</a> (which is more or less meant to be a tutorial), we\
      \ recently got <a href=\"/Legacy:DM-Encarceration\" title=\"Legacy:DM-Encarceration\"\
      >DM-Encarceration</a>. Is that something we should encourage, or should we rather\
      \ ask people not to use the Unreal Wiki for that purpose?</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ If the sole aim of the Wiki is to provide a single point of reference for\
      \ everything related to <i>doing</i> things with the Unreal engine then I would\
      \ say not. In which case the <i>Creating DM-Quadroid</i> page should definately\
      \ be renamed to <i>Tutorial DM-Quadroid</i> cos that's what it is (more or less).\
      \ If the Wiki has a secondary goal of allowing the contributors to strut their\
      \ stuff and pimp their <i>l33t h4x0r sk1llz</i> then it's fine.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ Early on I had considered that we could host mappers, but that would a separate\
      \ branch where mappers get their own subdomain. I'm not longer sure that's a\
      \ good idea. I don't know if QAPete wants to host mappers directly from BU (he's\
      \ not at the moment AFAIK), and I don't know if that's because he doesn't feel\
      \ he has the space or doesn't want too many hosted sites. In case 2, a \"United\
      \ Association of Mappers\" would be a single hosted site with subdomains. Anyway,\
      \ all that's more or less been dropped. I suggested that \"leet\" mappers could\
      \ do \"masterclasses\", where they take one of their famous maps and explain\
      \ how they made it: the techniques, the ideas, the thought-process behind the\
      \ design. With ut2003, all the \"leetness\" is reset, so it'll be a while before\
      \ some great maps arise &amp; become well-known enough. Another idea was to\
      \ give several mappers a simple map, like one box room or a corridor, and say\
      \ \"make this leet\", and then showcase the different results. I don't yet have\
      \ a feel for static mesh mapping but I think there may be less possiblity for\
      \ architectural creativity now, unless one plays with Maya. So <i>that</i> idea\
      \ might be down the pan too. To close this lengthy ramble, I would say we should\
      \ only showcase things if the principal aim is to demonstrate or instruct, in\
      \ which case 2D screenshots are important too. Entropic, maybe we should rename\
      \ those map tutorial pages so they don't have a name: \"Simple DM Map Tutorial\"\
      \ for example, so people don't get the wrong idea.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ Given the above comments then those pages definately need renaming. Something\
      \ a bit shorter and snappier would be nice though - maybe <i>Tutorial DM (UT)</i>\
      \ and <i>Tutorial DM</i> – assuming I have the naming conventions right. It's\
      \ a shame to lose the name as I'm intending to make the DM tutorials build <i>equivalent</i>\
      \ maps but no matter. It is of very little consequence. I'll tweak the name\
      \ of what will become the DD tutorial. I'm still playing my way through the\
      \ single player game of UT2003, so I've not even bothered to look at the editor\
      \ in any real depth. I figured I'd do well to get a feel for the new game first.\
      \ If I had to give a single word summary it would be <i>passable</i>. Most of\
      \ the maps are adequate but none have really grabbed me as stunning.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Bump. At least mappers should put their map project pages below their personal\
      \ page.</p>\n<p><b>Flashman:</b> <i><b>&lt;RANT&gt;</b></i> ...which I did,\
      \ then Tarq comes along and informs me that the <a href=\"/Legacy:Flashman/Projects\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Flashman/Projects\">projects page</a> I created should be under\
      \ <a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Journal\" title=\"Category:Legacy Journal\">Category:Legacy\
      \ Journal</a> instead?<br />\nThis made sense until I read this topic. (props\
      \ to Mychaeel for the bump) You see IMHO (not that it holds any sway fact wise,\
      \ but might give an idea of what the fresh contrubitor typically thinks...)\
      \ UWiki is a place for the various minds of the UEd community to come together,\
      \ share knowledge, and advise each other, but in addition to that it can be\
      \ (with the use of the personal pages) a place where peeps come in search of\
      \ a Texture artist to help them in their latest project, or where the 1337 mappers\
      \ among us (myself most definitely <i>not</i> in that bracket) can see other\
      \ peoples efforts and if they wish offer honest advice and support to help kick\
      \ the community as a whole along to greater things. This sort of feedback cannot\
      \ come from your average play-tests or reviewers, because it will provide moreinsight\
      \ into technical issues alongside artistic considerations, and it will come\
      \ from the minds of not just one, but possibly many contributors. This is a\
      \ focus I reckon the Wiki could have, but doesn't need any modification for.<br\
      \ />\nI don't mean that the zips should be hosted here of every map someon wants\
      \ feedback about, but just information about the project, one or two screenies\
      \ perhaps, and a discussion below. If you're in any doubt about the sort of\
      \ page I mean, look at my attempt: <a href=\"/Legacy:Flashman/Projects\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Flashman/Projects\">flashman/projects</a>. People could then put a link\
      \ to an FTP where the map is hosted, or ask people who wanted to see a copy\
      \ to submit their email addy. <i><b>&lt;/RANT&gt;</b></i></p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Putting those map pages in the mappers' areas under <a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Journal\"\
      \ title=\"Category:Legacy Journal\">Category:Legacy Journal</a> sounds good\
      \ to me (better than making them subpages of their personal pages). There's\
      \ only a single level of subpages though, so different maps would all have to\
      \ be on the same page. (I just dislike top-level map pages.)</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ Alternatively you could create mutliple journal pages and just prefix the\
      \ page name with your name. Having a single journal page will be unworkable\
      \ in the long run as it will get far too long to have any real meaning. My single\
      \ flag CTF mod journal will be huge once I've finished the mod. Personally,\
      \ I wouldn't mind seeing a <a href=\"/Legacy:Map_Ideas\" title=\"Legacy:Map\
      \ Ideas\">Map Ideas</a> equivalent for the <a href=\"/Legacy:Mod_Ideas\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Mod Ideas\">Mod Ideas</a> page. The attempt for formalise a way of specifying\
      \ a map design would be an interesting exercise in its own right. In terms of\
      \ actually hosting pages for completed maps I'm not so sure about. Surely BU\
      \ has an area for that (if not maybe it needs one). I realise I abuse the Wiki\
      \ slightly because I create pages that allow me to keep a single version of\
      \ a \"doc\" in one place, accessable from both home and work, but in the case\
      \ of my current <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:EntropicLqd/EntropicMapInCreepMode?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:EntropicLqd/EntropicMapInCreepMode (page does\
      \ not exist)\">EntropicLqd/EntropicMapInCreepMode</a> page, once I've finished\
      \ the spec. the page will vanish. It's a shame there is only one level of sub-pages.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> It is perhaps strange to have the \"journal\" pages as subpages\
      \ elsewhere. That's just the way it grew. I'm currently wondering if we should\
      \ encourage pages for comment/opinion/debate to be non-subpages – see for example\

      \ on a page to be eligible for inclusion in that list. Add a new paragraph?\
      \ At a single, but very useful bit of information? Fix a typo that completely\
      \ changed the meaning of a paragraph? Fix a typo that just looked bad? (That's\

      <p>Since all page names on the Wiki are bound to start with a digit or a capital\

      external free\" href=\"http://www.unrealwiki.com/mychaeel\">http://www.unrealwiki.com/mychaeel</a>\
      \ would instead lead to a \"file not found\" error.</p>\n<p>Thinking of it though\
      \ that's not too much of an issue – people should simply not link to pages in\
      \ any other than their original capitalization (that is, with a capital initial\
      \ in any case).</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b> What about moving the regular directories\
      \ and files to a subdirectory, which the webserver then checks for in the URL\
      \ and doesn't rewrite the URL if this new directory is present?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ it's a fairly small number of subdirectories that are accessed from the browser.\
      \ In fact, /wiki-ext/ is the only one I can think of. Easier to just list them\
      \ rather than move files about.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Speaking in terms of\
      \ URLs, we have</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>images/</code> for images,</li>\n<li><code>cgi-bin/</code>\
      \ for certain scripts such as the image uploader,</li>\n<li><code>wiki-ext/</code>\
      \ for images and styles, and</li>\n<li><code>dl.php</code> for mirrored downloads.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>Those \"virtual\" directories could indeed be explicitly excluded\
      \ from the internal forwarding to the Wiki script. The downside is that there\
      \ are some <i>more</i> common requests for files on a web server's domain root\
      \ that would also be forwarded to the Wiki script even though the proper response\
      \ would <i>not</i> be having the Wiki script return a \"Page not found\" page,\
      \ such as (but not necessarily limited to)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>favicon.ico</code>\
      \ (requested by browsers under certain circumstances)</li>\n<li><code>robots.txt</code>\
      \ (requested by search engine spiders)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think it'd be best\
      \ to limit the requests that are directed to the Wiki script to those that start\
      \ with a capital letter or a digit and forward everything else to the web server's\
      \ default handling. (And maybe we should modify the Wiki script so that it will\
      \ always redirect the user's browser to the \"canonical\" representation of\
      \ a page name – initial caps for every word – unless it is given that way in\
      \ the request already.)</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b> Yes. Of course you would have\
      \ to run a script on the wiki to ensure there's no lower-case/no first number\
      \ page names existing in the wiki, and modify the create new page script to\
      \ enforce uppercase page names. BTW I do plan to renew the domain in a few days.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> The Wiki script enforces capital initials for page names\
      \ already. There might be an arcane way to create pages starting with a lowercase\
      \ letter, but that's more a bug than a feature (given that you can't successfully\
      \ <i>link</i> to one such page within the wiki) that could be either ignored\
      \ or fixed.</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b> This presumes BeyondUnreal runs a case-sensitive\
      \ filesystem - does it?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> It actually presumes that the\
      \ Wiki script is case-sensitive. That, though, happens to depend in turn on\
      \ the underlying file system, and that's indeed case-sensitive on BeyondUnreal's\
      \ Linux server.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> I've just renewed the registration\

      \ produce a Sitemap for Google. It saves google a lot of time digging through\

      \ sites by giving google a sitemap to use. Too bad other search engines don't\
      \ have the same feature, google's spider is very friendly compared to some (e.g.\
      \ Yahoo Slurp, MSNbot, AskJeeves (listed from worst to less terrible)).</p>\n\

      \ any attempt to save a page whose page source contains <code>display:</code>\
      \ <code>none</code> to the <a href=\"/Legacy:Chongqing_Page\" title=\"Legacy:Chongqing\
      \ Page\">Chongqing Page</a>. However, some spammers seem to manage to sneak\
      \ past that filter occasionally. I'm frankly at a loss right now as to how –\
      \ even if I just load the revision they saved and try to save it myself, the\
      \ filter works on <i>me</i>. Does anybody have any ideas or guesses?</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b>\
      \ I did a few tests on my personal page using <code>display:</code> <code>none</code>\
      \ and was happy that the wiki won't lock you out and sad to see that even the\
      \ preview button redirects you hehe. After a few tests I thought that browser\
      \ settings might allow spammers to spam like that so I fired up mozilla and\
      \ disabled javascript images and some other stuff. It still redirected me. Then\
      \ I thought that perhaps if you embed the html into a wiki tag or something,\
      \ the parser will ignore it and continue on. I don't think that works though.\
      \ Now I'm thinking maybe there are certain characters that are ignored and deleted\
      \ after the wiki scans the updates for the bad code. For example...</p>\n<p>If\
      \ the&#160;% sign was ignored and deleted 'd%i%s%' etc would be saved as 'dis'...</p>\n\
      <p><b>Wormbo:</b> Oh right, browsers discard any null characters they encounter\
      \ and process the remaining text as if the nulls were never there. Perl allows\
      \ and understands \\0 chars, doesn't it? Would at least be a reason why the\
      \ regex doesn't match.<br />\nAnd while we're at it, add another (maybe hidden)\
      \ checkbox to the delete image page that says \"ban me\". Or maybe create a\
      \ \"restore image\" feature or restrict deleting images to admins. I have a\
      \ feeling random people are deleting images just for fun.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b>\
      \ Yeah, I think the images should be set up like normal pages, where when an\
      \ image is deleted it stays in 'memory' for awhile so that it can restored,\
      \ unless it was marked as 'Permanent Delete' by an admin. Random people ARE\
      \ deleting random images for fun &gt;_&lt;</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> There's\
      \ an \"undelete image\" feature here (even for bulk undeletions) – <code><a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/images-restore.cgi\"\
      >http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/images-restore.cgi</a></code>. We do have\
      \ image revisions, but the \"delete image\" feature is more more like the \"\
      delete page\" feature than anything else – it'd be pointless to delete images\
      \ in a way that leaves them accessible.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Good to know.\
      \ I've restored some of the deleted images.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> I just deleted\
      \ about 75 pages created by spambots and reverted a few more pages. All of them\
      \ had \"display<code>:</code> none\" spam on them.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Seems\
      \ like the fix <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki?action=browse&amp;diff=1&amp;id=Mod_Ideas%2FNukeRifles&amp;revision=16&amp;diffrevision=15\"\
      >didn't work</a>...</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Seems so. I'm going to add some\
      \ debug code in the hope to find out what exactly is submitted next time.</p>\n\
      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> How does the redirection work? Does it do it with the browser\
      \ (i.e. meta redirect stuff) or does it do it some other way. I would think\
      \ that if you were using the browser to redirect and the bot wasn't using an\
      \ actual 'browser' then redirection wouldn't work on it. And I'm sure if you\
      \ created a custom browser that you could bypass most anything.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ Redirection means that instead of saving the page and sending it as response,\
      \ a HTTP redirect to the <a href=\"/Legacy:Chongqing_Page\" title=\"Legacy:Chongqing\
      \ Page\">Chongqing Page</a> is send and nothing is saved. However, it seems\
      \ that the spam detection script no longer works: some spambots just replaced\
      \ several pages with a lot of links.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> Site is locked for\
      \ now as bots are still active.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Small wonder our locks,\
      \ spam filters etc. didn't do anything: The spammers were posting to <code>wiki-umw.cgi</code>\
      \ rather than <code>wiki.cgi</code>. I've disabled that possibility. – Now that\
      \ leaves me with the question how <code>wiki-umw.cgi</code> got there... does\
      \ anybody remember putting it there?</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> We just gota new\
      \ lower-case named page. Anyone care to investigate? *bump*</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ Attempting to create a lowercase page should send you to the New Contributors\
      \ page, same as if you try to save a new page without editing the default text.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Wormbo:</b> Site locked again after multiple bots bombed three pages with\

      <p><b>MythOpus:</b> I just became aware(been clueless for awhile apparently)\

      \ [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=249 Unreal Wiki forum]\n\
      \nMoved discussions:\n\n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Versions]]: how\
      \ do deal with differences in UnrealEd 1 / 2 / 2.6. Discuss.\n* [[Legacy:Wiki\
      \ Public Relations|Wiki Public Relations]]: discuss publicity for the project\
      \ here\n* [[Legacy:Subtopic Discussion|Subtopic Discussion]]\n* [[Legacy:Wiki\
      \ Growth|Wiki Growth]] musings on stuff\n\n==BU Hosted Site Updates Link==\n\
      \nFollow BU's Hosted Site Updates link about [[Legacy:UCPP|UCPP]] and you'll\
      \ find yourself on [[Legacy:Home Page|Home Page]] (which mentions nothing on\
      \ the topic).\n\nPerhaps the link should point to [[Legacy:Featured Pages|Featured\
      \ Pages]]?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Yeah, I'm not sure what to do about that. I've\
      \ linked to [[Legacy:Featured Pages|Featured Pages]] quite high up on the home\
      \ page. On the other hand, [[Legacy:Featured Pages|Featured Pages]] doesn't\
      \ say much to a new visitor. Any further thoughts on this?\n\n'''El Muerte:'''\
      \ A \"news\" page? That contains a short intro and the recent \"Hosted Site\
      \ Updates\" entries with links to the corresponding pages.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ I've created [[Legacy:News|News]]. It currently redirects to [[Legacy:Featured\
      \ Pages|Featured Pages]], but we can improve on it later, or simply move [[Legacy:Featured\
      \ Pages|Featured Pages]].\n\n==Encyclopaedia vs. Tutorials==\n\nEncyclopaedia\
      \ vs. Tutorials: What should this project look like? \n\nThe project started\
      \ covering the UScript class tree, as there's an obvious topic hierarchy, whereas\
      \ with tutes the divisons are a bit more blurry. Particularly, the (arbitrary)\
      \ division of tutorials into beginner/intermediate/advanced isn't conducive\
      \ to finding information when the split is over several pages.\n\nThe real mapper\
      \ beginner could be lost in all the knowledge of a complex encyclopedia. Ideas\
      \ (mostly now implemented):\n*  mini 'real' tutorials at the end of each section.\
      \ For example, at the end of the [[Legacy:Effects|effects]] page a little article\
      \ 'Now follow this tutorial to make an exploding wall with smoke'. That's what\
      \ beginners are looking for, and that's the best way to learn.\n* example: the\
      \ page on the [[Legacy:Mover|Mover]] class stands as a reference document, but\
      \ a page that explains what a mover is and the basics of using it is needed\
      \ too, for example [[Legacy:Create A Mover|Create A Mover]].\n* similar to disambiguation\
      \ pages on Wikipedia: technical pages such as [[Legacy:Mover|Mover]] begin with\
      \ links to tutorials on the subject. Put either a tutorial, or a link to it\
      \ at the beginning of each page. Then after practice,explain the theory. Advanced\
      \ disciples would just skip the tutorial part.\n\nNovice and pro mappers browse\
      \ differently, because they will be visualizing the process from a different\
      \ perspective. Refactoring redundant and duplicated information is time-consuming.\n\
      \n==Other projects==\n\n===unrealscript@yahoogroups===\n\nThe mailing list at\
      \ yahoo has generated loads of compiled Q&A documents, which are partially archived\
      \ at yahoo & at http://www.chessmess.com when it's up.\n\nI've suggested on\
      \ that list that they could be imported into the Wiki. There's some duplication\
      \ & it might be an idea to refactor things into expositions rather than Q&A\
      \ format. Anyway, I was thinking of inviting the mods from that group to discuss\
      \ the idea here, wondering if anyone had opinions on the subject.\n\n==Maps\
      \ on the Wiki==\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Do I see a new trend here...?  After [[Legacy:Creating\
      \ DM-Quadroid|Creating DM-Quadroid]] (which is more or less meant to be a tutorial),\
      \ we recently got [[Legacy:DM-Encarceration|DM-Encarceration]].  Is that something\
      \ we should encourage, or should we rather ask people not to use the Unreal\
      \ Wiki for that purpose?\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' If the sole aim of the Wiki is\
      \ to provide a single point of reference for everything related to ''doing''\
      \ things with the Unreal engine then I would say not.  In which case the ''Creating\
      \ DM-Quadroid'' page should definately be renamed to ''Tutorial DM-Quadroid''\
      \ cos that's what it is (more or less).  If the Wiki has a secondary goal of\
      \ allowing the contributors to strut their stuff and pimp their ''l33t h4x0r\
      \ sk1llz'' then it's fine.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Early on I had considered that\
      \ we could host mappers, but that would a separate branch where mappers get\
      \ their own subdomain. I'm not longer sure that's a good idea. I don't know\
      \ if QAPete wants to host mappers directly from BU (he's not at the moment AFAIK),\
      \ and I don't know if that's because he doesn't feel he has the space or doesn't\
      \ want too many hosted sites. In case 2, a \"United Association of Mappers\"\
      \ would be a single hosted site with subdomains. Anyway, all that's more or\
      \ less been dropped. I suggested that \"leet\" mappers could do \"masterclasses\"\
      , where they take one of their famous maps and explain how they made it: the\
      \ techniques, the ideas, the thought-process behind the design. With ut2003,\
      \ all the \"leetness\" is reset, so it'll be a while before some great maps\
      \ arise & become well-known enough. Another idea was to give several mappers\
      \ a simple map, like one box room or a corridor, and say \"make this leet\"\
      , and then showcase the different results. I don't yet have a feel for static\
      \ mesh mapping but I think there may be less possiblity for architectural creativity\
      \ now, unless one plays with Maya. So ''that'' idea might be down the pan too.\
      \ To close this lengthy ramble, I would say we should only showcase things if\
      \ the principal aim is to demonstrate or instruct, in which case 2D screenshots\
      \ are important too. Entropic, maybe we should rename those map tutorial pages\
      \ so they don't have a name: \"Simple DM Map Tutorial\" for example, so people\
      \ don't get the wrong idea.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Given the above comments then\
      \ those pages definately need renaming.  Something a bit shorter and snappier\
      \ would be nice though - maybe ''Tutorial DM (UT)'' and ''Tutorial DM'' &ndash;\
      \ assuming I have the naming conventions right.  It's a shame to lose the name\
      \ as I'm intending to make the DM tutorials build ''equivalent'' maps but no\
      \ matter.  It is of very little consequence.  I'll tweak the name of what will\
      \ become the DD tutorial.  I'm still playing my way through the single player\
      \ game of UT2003, so I've not even bothered to look at the editor in any real\
      \ depth.  I figured I'd do well to get a feel for the new game first.  If I\
      \ had to give a single word summary it would be ''passable''.  Most of the maps\
      \ are adequate but none have really grabbed me as stunning.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Bump.  At least mappers should put their map project pages below their personal\
      \ page.\n\n'''Flashman:''' '''''<RANT>''''' ...which I did, then Tarq comes\
      \ along and informs me that the [[Legacy:Flashman/Projects|projects page]] I\
      \ created should be under [[:Category:Legacy Journal]] instead?<br />This made\
      \ sense until I read this topic. (props to Mychaeel for the bump) You see IMHO\
      \ (not that it holds any sway fact wise, but might give an idea of what the\
      \ fresh contrubitor typically thinks...) UWiki is a place for the various minds\
      \ of the UEd community to come together, share knowledge, and advise each other,\
      \ but in addition to that it can be (with the use of the personal pages) a place\
      \ where peeps come in search of a Texture artist to help them in their latest\
      \ project, or where the 1337 mappers among us (myself most definitely ''not''\
      \ in that bracket) can see other peoples efforts and if they wish offer honest\
      \ advice and support to help kick the community as a whole along to greater\
      \ things. This sort of feedback cannot come from your average play-tests or\
      \ reviewers, because it will provide moreinsight into technical issues alongside\
      \ artistic considerations, and it will come from the minds of not just one,\
      \ but possibly many contributors. This is a focus I reckon the Wiki could have,\
      \ but doesn't need any modification for.<br />I don't mean that the zips should\
      \ be hosted here of every map someon wants feedback about, but just information\
      \ about the project, one or two screenies perhaps, and a discussion below. If\
      \ you're in any doubt about the sort of page I mean, look at my attempt: [[Legacy:Flashman/Projects|flashman/projects]].\
      \ People could then put a link to an FTP where the map is hosted, or ask people\
      \ who wanted to see a copy to submit their email addy. '''''</RANT>'''''\n\n\
      '''Mychaeel:''' Putting those map pages in the mappers' areas under [[:Category:Legacy\
      \ Journal]] sounds good to me (better than making them subpages of their personal\
      \ pages).  There's only a single level of subpages though, so different maps\
      \ would all have to be on the same page.  (I just dislike top-level map pages.)\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' Alternatively you could create mutliple journal pages and\
      \ just prefix the page name with your name.  Having a single journal page will\
      \ be unworkable in the long run as it will get far too long to have any real\
      \ meaning.  My single flag CTF mod journal will be huge once I've finished the\
      \ mod.  Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing a [[Legacy:Map Ideas|Map Ideas]]\
      \ equivalent for the [[Legacy:Mod Ideas|Mod Ideas]] page.  The attempt for formalise\
      \ a way of specifying a map design would be an interesting exercise in its own\
      \ right.  In terms of actually hosting pages for completed maps I'm not so sure\
      \ about.  Surely BU has an area for that (if not maybe it needs one).  I realise\
      \ I abuse the Wiki slightly because I create pages that allow me to keep a single\
      \ version of a \"doc\" in one place, accessable from both home and work, but\
      \ in the case of my current [[Legacy:EntropicLqd/EntropicMapInCreepMode|EntropicLqd/EntropicMapInCreepMode]]\
      \ page, once I've finished the spec. the page will vanish.  It's a shame there\
      \ is only one level of sub-pages.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' It is perhaps strange to\
      \ have the \"journal\" pages as subpages elsewhere. That's just the way it grew.\
      \ I'm currently wondering if we should encourage pages for comment/opinion/debate\
      \ to be non-subpages &ndash; see for example the Curse of Static Meshes page.\
      \ \n\n==Time Zone Offset==\n\n'''RoninLord:''' It would make it easier to have\
      \ the time zone offset from UTC rather than local server time. Everyone knows\
      \ their UTC offset off the top of their head, and Time Zone offset on its own\
      \ usually refers to UTC offset. While you only have to do it once, it would\
      \ make it easier for new users.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I doubt many users know what\
      \ UTC is to start with.  The \"Preferences\" page displays the current server\
      \ time directly over the time zone offset just in order to make it easy to figure\
      \ out the offset:  If server time is 6 PM and your local time is 2 PM (check\
      \ your watch), the offset is obviously 4 hours.\n\n'''RoninLord:''' Well took\
      \ a little time to workout for me, I had to calculate for the next day. While\
      \ your probably right on not many people knowing of UTC, but then I wouldn't\
      \ survive with out knowing it. As a coder and network admin I couldn't survive\
      \ without it :)\n\n==Namespaces==\n\n'''DJPaul:''' Bing!  Take [[Legacy:Actor\
      \ (UT)|Actor (UT)]] as an example; that's obviously a page for UT.  What do\
      \ we do for the UT2003 version?  I'm seeing a lot of like, [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]]\
      \ page naming in this case because this is a bad idea - not specifcially for\
      \ the actor class, but what happens if we bring along a Deus Ex version?  Is\
      \ that a [[Legacy:Actor (DX)|Actor (DX)]]?  If it is, therefore is UT2003 the\
      \ main game - i.e. should unsuffixed pages presumed to be about UT2003?\n\n\
      '''Mychaeel:''' Yes, that's how it is handled at the moment.  (If somebody makes\
      \ a list of all class page names relating to [[Legacy:UT|UT]] that don't have\
      \ a \"(UT)\" suffix yet, we could batch-rename them.)\n\n==Personal Attribution==\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Some newly created pages contain statements that clearly attribute\
      \ that page to its initial creator.  It's customary here though that [[MeatBall:DocumentMode]]\
      \ contributions are anonymous (just like they are \"public domain\" in terms\
      \ of our [[Legacy:Project Copyright|copyright statement]]).\n\nPersonal attribution\
      \ also inhibits other people's freedom of editing a page, which is generally\
      \ in contrast to the Wiki idea and, in the Unreal Wiki, only used where we copied\
      \ previously existing static documents with the author's permission.\n\nHow\
      \ should we go about this?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' One possibilty is to rewrite as\
      \ \"Page contributors: *list*\". This is done on some Meatball pages when different\
      \ things are refactored into a single document. People would be honour-bound\
      \ to only add their names to the list if they'd made a major contribution to\
      \ the tutorial or article. But I'd rather people did things the other way round:\
      \ maybe keep a list of which areas they've worked on at their personal page\
      \ and keep the articles themselves clean.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Yes... I think\
      \ of all options (except keeping documents anonymous altogether) asking people\
      \ to keep a list of pages they worked on on their personal page if they want\
      \ to and keep the documents themselves clean is the best.\n\nAny \"list of authors\"\
      \ on a page implies that everybody who's not on that list didn't contribute\
      \ anything, and that raises the question ''what'' and ''how much'' somebody\
      \ has to change on a page to be eligible for inclusion in that list.  Add a\
      \ new paragraph?  At a single, but very useful bit of information?  Fix a typo\
      \ that completely changed the meaning of a paragraph?  Fix a typo that just\
      \ looked bad?  (That's a rhetoric question, none to be answered &ndash; that'd\
      \ be futile anyway, which is my point.)\n\n'''Sobiwan:''' The way I see it,\
      \ WIKI is a public effort by its definition.  Personal recognition, posterity,\
      \ notoriety and other forms of ego boosting are opposite to the goal of collecting\
      \ public information.  Keep it anonymous, dont worry about who gets bragging\
      \ rights and focus only on getting accurate and concise information into the\
      \ WIKI.  \n\n'''SuperApe:''' I'm in agreement.  That's why I tentatively added\
      \ the Content Ownership subsection to the Discussion on [[Legacy:New Contributors\
      \ Quick Start|New Contributors Quick Start]].  Should that be moved to the main\
      \ body of that page?\n\n==Ghost Links==\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Creating links to\
      \ non-existing pages on \"topic\" or \"table of contents\" pages without the\
      \ actual intention of creating that page is, I believe, counterproductive.\n\
      \nThe problem is similar to that of creating sticky postings in a forum:  Those\
      \ page links soon become just part of the normality that's perceived as such\
      \ by the regulars and so, as time goes by, it becomes increasingly likely that\
      \ the corresponding page will actually never be created.  The title \"rough\
      \ draft\" on [[Legacy:Project Copyright|Project Copyright]] has a similar problem.\
      \  (I am going to remove it shortly, but I'll leave it there for demonstration\
      \ purposes.)\n\nNote that linking to a non-existing page from within the flow\
      \ of another page &ndash; like linking to [[Legacy:Bot|Bot]] from [[Legacy:Bot\
      \ Support|Bot Support]] &ndash; is a different matter and not subject to this\
      \ statement of mine.\n\n'''Sweavo:''' I agree wholeheartedly.  A table of contents\
      \ is a means of indexing information that is there.  If there's no information\
      \ then it's just noise.  However I got caught out posting a Delete Me tag to\
      \ such a page that had only been up one minute!  So it's probably worth allowing\
      \ such pages a day's grace before deleting them!\n\n==www.unrealwiki.com==\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' The domain http://www.unrealwiki.com is fully functional now\
      \ as a direct alternative to http://wiki.beyondunreal.com (not a HTTP-level\
      \ redirect or a HTML frameset hack).  Thanks to DJPaul for funding the domain\
      \ registration during the last and for the next year.\n\nThe redirect from http://www.unrealwiki.com\
      \ still leads to http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/ &ndash; I haven't figured\
      \ out yet how to make it depend on the host name and redirect to http://www.unrealwiki.com/wiki/\
      \ '''only if''' \"www.unrealwiki.com\" was originally entered in the browser's\
      \ address bar.  I wouldn't like to automatically redirect everybody to www.unrealwiki.com\
      \ ''yet'' since most people's cookies still refer to wiki.beyondunreal.com and\
      \ won't work without [[Legacy:Log In|logging in]] anew for the new domain.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' I don't know enough about the technical side to form an opinion.\
      \ As for our canonical address:\n* http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/ \n** promotes\
      \ BU\n** if we move from BU / BU dies, we're in trouble\n* http://www.unrealwiki.com/\
      \ \n** is easy to remember\n** if we move from BU / BU dies, there's no problem\n\
      ** if we run out of money, we're in trouble\n\nWhat do other people think? I'm\
      \ cool whichever way :)\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Well... I don't think that running\
      \ out of money will be a problem anytime soon, given that it doesn't really\
      \ cost a fortune to keep the domain up.  (For that matter, if BeyondUnreal would\
      \ suddenly cease to exist we'd be in problems anyway &ndash; Unreal Wiki's bandwidth\
      \ certainly costs more than the domain.)\n\n'''DJPaul:''' http://www.unrealwiki.com/Unreal_Engine/\
      \ would be nicer still.  You could mod_redirect http://www.unrealwiki.com/wiki/Unreal_Engine/\
      \ to the aforementioned address, and do a similar thing for just http://www.unrealwiki.com/.\n\
      \nDoes BU uses Apache as a webserver?  If so, I can write up a .htaccess redirect\
      \ if the server has mod_redirect installed and give it to you (just two lines).\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' I would not want http://www.unrealwiki.com/Whatever to be\
      \ a ''redirect'' to http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/Whatever &ndash; that'd\
      \ still mean the latter address would eventually appear in the browser's address\
      \ bar.\n\nIt is quite possible to internally direct http://www.unrealwiki.com/Whatever\
      \ (and http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/Whatever) without the \"/wiki\" part directly\
      \ to the Wiki script and have it return the corresponding page.  The technical\
      \ problem, however, is that there are regular directories and files on http://www.unrealwiki.com\
      \ as well &ndash; and such file requests should obviously ''not'' be directed\
      \ to the Wiki script but handled by the server directly.  Right now, the \"\
      /wiki\" part serves to clearly distinguish page requests from regular file requests.\n\
      \nSince all page names on the Wiki are bound to start with a digit or a capital\
      \ letter (and all regular files and directories are lowercase by convention),\
      \ that could serve to distinguish a page request from a regular file request\
      \ &ndash; but then again right now it's also perfectly legal to enter the address\
      \ http://www.unrealwiki.com/wiki/mychaeel (note the small \"m\") to get to my\
      \ home page, and the corresponding \"new\" request http://www.unrealwiki.com/mychaeel\
      \ would instead lead to a \"file not found\" error.\n\nThinking of it though\
      \ that's not too much of an issue &ndash; people should simply not link to pages\
      \ in any other than their original capitalization (that is, with a capital initial\
      \ in any case).\n\n'''DJPaul:''' What about moving the regular directories and\
      \ files to a subdirectory, which the webserver then checks for in the URL and\
      \ doesn't rewrite the URL if this new directory is present?\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ it's a fairly small number of subdirectories that are accessed from the browser.\
      \ In fact, /wiki-ext/ is the only one I can think of. Easier to just list them\
      \ rather than move files about.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Speaking in terms of URLs,\
      \ we have\n* <code>images/</code> for images,\n* <code>cgi-bin/</code> for certain\
      \ scripts such as the image uploader,\n* <code>wiki-ext/</code> for images and\
      \ styles, and\n* <code>dl.php</code> for mirrored downloads.\n\nThose \"virtual\"\
      \ directories could indeed be explicitly excluded from the internal forwarding\
      \ to the Wiki script.  The downside is that there are some ''more'' common requests\
      \ for files on a web server's domain root that would also be forwarded to the\
      \ Wiki script even though the proper response would ''not'' be having the Wiki\
      \ script return a \"Page not found\" page, such as (but not necessarily limited\
      \ to)\n* <code>favicon.ico</code> (requested by browsers under certain circumstances)\n\
      * <code>robots.txt</code> (requested by search engine spiders)\n\nI think it'd\
      \ be best to limit the requests that are directed to the Wiki script to those\
      \ that start with a capital letter or a digit and forward everything else to\
      \ the web server's default handling.  (And maybe we should modify the Wiki script\
      \ so that it will always redirect the user's browser to the \"canonical\" representation\
      \ of a page name &ndash; initial caps for every word &ndash; unless it is given\
      \ that way in the request already.)\n\n'''DJPaul:''' Yes.  Of course you would\
      \ have to run a script on the wiki to ensure there's no lower-case/no first\
      \ number page names existing in the wiki, and modify the create new page script\
      \ to enforce uppercase page names.  BTW I do plan to renew the domain in a few\
      \ days.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' The Wiki script enforces capital initials for page\
      \ names already.  There might be an arcane way to create pages starting with\
      \ a lowercase letter, but that's more a bug than a feature (given that you can't\
      \ successfully ''link'' to one such page within the wiki) that could be either\
      \ ignored or fixed.\n\n'''DJPaul:''' This presumes BeyondUnreal runs a case-sensitive\
      \ filesystem - does it?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' It actually presumes that the Wiki\
      \ script is case-sensitive.  That, though, happens to depend in turn on the\
      \ underlying file system, and that's indeed case-sensitive on BeyondUnreal's\
      \ Linux server.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I've just renewed the registration of unrealwiki.com\
      \ for another two years.  If somebody feels like sending me a share of the 22\
      \ USD I paid, let me know ;-)\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' unrealwiki.com remains securely\
      \ in our hands until (at least) 2010. (I can hardly believe my previous statement\
      \ is two years old now.)\n\n==Google Search==\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I just tried\
      \ using Google to find ''anything'' about UnrealScript, but the Wiki was not\
      \ listed ''at all''. Explicitly searching for \"site:wiki.beyondunreal.com <put\
      \ anything here>\" doesn't seem to find anything either.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' That\
      \ would explain why our [[Legacy:Wiki Site Stats|Wiki Site Stats]] dropped a\
      \ couple of months ago. I wonder if Google have changed something like their\
      \ response to robots.txt. I don't think anything has been changed here. We have\
      \ a problem.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Unreal Wiki still doesn't show up in Google, Lycos\
      \ or AllTheWeb searches. I only checked the sites Opera displays by default,\
      \ but I'm quite sure all others don't list the wiki either.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ Doing a search for Unreal Wiki using altavista gives the wiki result number\
      \ 1.  Doing the same on google gives a zillion links to articles with links\
      \ but no direct ones (I got bored after 10 result pages).  Same with yahoo (looks\
      \ like they use google tbh).  web.ask.com also lists the Wiki home page.  It's\
      \ a conspiracy I tell you.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' I just submitted both the unreal\
      \ wiki and the UDN to the ODP project that google runs.  We'll see if that does\
      \ the trick.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' We're still not on Google :( Is something still\
      \ blocking the bot, or is it just a question of waiting patiently?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ We have regular visits of \"Mediapartners-Google/2.1 (+http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html)\"\
      , but I believe that's only related to the Google ads at the bottom of the page.\
      \ &ndash; In addition, I've found visits from \"Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html)\"\
      \ in recent logs which in turn I believe is indeed Google's spider.  Maybe we're\
      \ soon in Google again...\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Google still haven't added this\
      \ site to their directory - it's a conspiracy I tell you.  Also, I dropped a\
      \ mail (2003-Dec-10) to the http://www.unrealtournament.com/ site asking for\
      \ the Unreal Wiki to be added to their community links page.  So far no joy\
      \ - might be worth a couple of other people mailing them.  It's a conspiracy\
      \ I tell you.  Also, the Unreal Wiki still doesn't show up in google.  Does\
      \ google block Wiki based sites in the same way that they block \"blogs\"?\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' The new Unreal Tournament site has a link now for submitting\
      \ fan sites so I've re-submitted the Wiki.  It broke the form which is a bit\
      \ of a bummer but I'll keep checking the site to see if the request got through.\
      \  I'll get the Wiki added yet.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' UT.com has mucked up our URL\
      \ :(\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Most likely because you added \"http://\" to it. I saw\
      \ other links also having this problem.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Still no sign of us\
      \ on Google :(\n\n'''Tarquin:''' January 2004: I've brought the matter up at\
      \ BU. Apparently they blocked the Google spider a while back. They're letting\
      \ it back in, so it's hopefully just a matter or time before we're back on Google:\
      \ [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=unreal+wiki&btnG=Google+Search]\n\
      \n'''El Muerte TDS:''' we're back on google, the page rank could be better,\
      \ but I think that'll take some time.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I don't think we are.\
      \ Those are things that link to us, not our own pages. Try [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&as_qdr=all&q=unreal+wiki+site%3Abeyondunreal.com&btnG=Google+Search]\
      \ for example. Could someone email QAPete about this? My email is out at the\
      \ moment.\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' wtf, I'm pretty sure I had a hit this morning\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Well, there ''are'' some Unreal Wiki pages on Google &ndash;\
      \ try [http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awiki.beyondunreal.com].  Very few,\
      \ but perhaps it'll get better with time. &ndash; Anyway, short of blocking\
      \ GoogleBot's IP address there's little QAPete could do to block it, and I don't\
      \ think he's doing it since we're getting GoogleBot hits on a regular basis,\
      \ probably related to the Google ads on the site.\n\n==Legenda==\n\n'''El Muerte\
      \ TDS:''' it would be usefull if every page that has some requirement (game/patch\
      \ depended) to have a box with the requirement list. Something like:\n\n{{innerbox|\
      \ > ==== Requirements ====\n\n > * UT2003 + Epic Bonus Pack #1\n\n > * UT2004\
      \ \n\n}}\n\nWould be nice if this could be a special tag, that puts a box in\
      \ the upper right corner:\n <requirements>\n * UT2003 + Epic Bonus Pack #1\n\
      \ * UT2004\n </requirements>\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Do we really need special markup?\
      \ Why not just write near the top of the page:\n\nRequirements:\n* UT2003 +\
      \ Epic Bonus Pack #1\n* UT2004\n\n'''El Muerte TDS:''' this just looks better:\n\
      \nhttp://redir.elmuerte.com/junk/wikireq.png\n\nI feel as if this should be\
      \ MANDATORY information for wiki pages - force editors to specify.  They could\
      \ set a preference to say \"well, I'm nearly always talking about UT2003\" which\
      \ would set the info for them when they write new pages.  The trouble we have\
      \ is that content authors do not have to specify what version their info applies\
      \ to, and yet they are the one person who can easily say that info.  Anyone\
      \ else who comes along to it will have a harder time figuring out that info\
      \ than the original author.\n\n==Reversion==\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''  After reverting\
      \ a number of pages I noticed it took like 4 clicks to revert each one. Would\
      \ it be feasable to add a \"revert to this revision\" link on recent changes\
      \ and/or the view other revisions list? It might also discourage wiki vandals\
      \ if there's a link right there showing how easy it is to revert changes.\n\n\
      '''Mychaeel:''' I see your point, but we have to be careful not to make it too\
      \ simple lest we encourage another type of spamming &ndash; the reversion of\
      \ a page to an older version.  We could, however, create an additional admin-only\
      \ script that bulk-reverts pages to the last revision before all edits done\
      \ from a given IP address.\n\n'''Graphik:'''  My suggestion: a list of edits\
      \ compiled from the diff logs that one can selectively revert, similar to the\
      \ way Image Uploads works. Or does UseMod have a feature similar to Windows\
      \ XP's System Restore?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' My suggestion: on the history page,\
      \ a link on each item that says \"restore this version\". Or a link at the foot\
      \ of an old revision isplay, saying \"restore this version\". Admin-only, like\
      \ Mych said. But Mych's bulk IP revert idea is good too, if it's possible to\
      \ code it.\n\n==Minor bug with Google Search and Page Templates==\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ Apparently, Google is following links to non-existant pages, recieving the\
      \ \"This page doesn't exist yet.\" template, and then including those non-existant\
      \ pages in the search.\n\n==Proper HTTP responses==\n\n'''El Muerte:''' I'd\
      \ like some improvements in the response headers of the wiki. Currently the\
      \ wiki is very inefficient:\n* Non existing pages produce a \"200 Ok\" return\
      \ instead of a \"404 Not Found\". Producing the 404 makes the wiki more efficient\
      \ for search engines, e.g. no incorrect results, but also makes it easier for\
      \ other things like the unrealwiki plugin for uncodex (all that is needed is\
      \ a HEAD request to check if the page exists).\n* No Last-Modified response.\
      \ The Last-Modified response is very useful for caching of pages, without a\
      \ Last-Modified response pages will never be cached. If the wiki engine also\
      \ correctly responds to the If-Modified-Since request the performance of the\
      \ wiki will increase a lot because cached versions of the pages can be used.\
      \ This has a positive effect on the performance of the client and server (and\
      \ I'm sure BU would like that).\n\nAnother thing that might be interesting is\
      \ to produce a Sitemap for Google. It saves google a lot of time digging through\
      \ the site since it has already has a map of the site containing info on what\
      \ page has been modified. I noticed a significant performance increase on my\
      \ sites by giving google a sitemap to use. Too bad other search engines don't\
      \ have the same feature, google's spider is very friendly compared to some (e.g.\
      \ Yahoo Slurp, MSNbot, AskJeeves (listed from worst to less terrible)).\n\n\
      '''Tarquin:''' I can't look into either of those right now because of [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=167169\
      \ this].\n\n'''El Muerte:''' I'm not allowed to view that forum.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Oops, sorry. Basically, since BU moved hosts, I can't log into FTP from any\
      \ OS X client. I'll need to set up a copy of the wiki on my linux system before\
      \ I can start looking at this.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''; El, could check this:  http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/fourohfour.cgi\
      \ Is it producing a 404 response for you? I've not done this in perl before.\
      \  \n\n'''El Muerte:''' yes, it returns a 404 error\n\n'''fyfe:''' For generating\
      \ the Google SiteMap I would recomend [http://gsitecrawler.com/ Google Site\
      \ Crawler], it'll crawl the wiki and generrate a sitemap file for you. Here's\

      ==Spammers and lower-case page names==\n\n'''Wormbo:''' It seems the spammers\
      \ have found a way to create pages starting with a lower-case character. These\
      \ pages are not accessible directly, but the (diff) link displays them and fortunately\
      \ it seems they can be deleted via \"Edit/Rename pages\".\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ yeah, looks like a bug in UseMod. Page names should always get an initial\
      \ upper-case character. I'll try to look into fixing this at some point &ndash;\
      \ but ongoing FTP problems with BU make this difficult.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I just\
      \ deleted two lower-case pages. Mych, could you have a look at this? Maybe renaming\
      \ the 'title' and 'text' fields as mentioned in IRC a while ago should block\
      \ automated spam bots for a while.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Removed one more lower-case\
      \ page name and some regular spam.\n\n==Spammers and \"<nowiki>display:</nowiki><nowiki>\
      \ none</nowiki>\"==\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' We have a simple filter that redirects\

      \ at a loss right now as to how &ndash; even if I just load the revision they\
      \ saved and try to save it myself, the filter works on ''me''.  Does anybody\
      \ have any ideas or guesses?\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I did a few tests on my personal\
      \ page using <code>display:</code><code> none</code> and was happy that the\
      \ wiki won't lock you out and sad to see that even the preview button redirects\
      \ you hehe.  After a few tests I thought that browser settings might allow spammers\
      \ to spam like that so I fired up mozilla and disabled javascript images and\
      \ some other stuff.  It still redirected me.  Then I thought that perhaps if\
      \ you embed the html into a wiki tag or something, the parser will ignore it\
      \ and continue on.  I don't think that works though.  Now I'm thinking maybe\
      \ there are certain characters that are ignored and deleted after the wiki scans\
      \ the updates for the bad code.  For example...\n\nIf the % sign was ignored\
      \ and deleted 'd%i%s%' etc would be saved as 'dis'...\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Oh right,\
      \ browsers discard any null characters they encounter and process the remaining\
      \ text as if the nulls were never there. Perl allows and understands \\0 chars,\
      \ doesn't it? Would at least be a reason why the regex doesn't match.<br />And\
      \ while we're at it, add another (maybe hidden) checkbox to the delete image\
      \ page that says \"ban me\". Or maybe create a \"restore image\" feature or\
      \ restrict deleting images to admins. I have a feeling random people are deleting\
      \ images just for fun.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Yeah, I think the images should be\
      \ set up like normal pages, where when an image is deleted it stays in 'memory'\
      \ for awhile so that it can restored, unless it was marked as 'Permanent Delete'\
      \ by an admin.  Random people ARE deleting random images for fun >_<\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ There's an \"undelete image\" feature here (even for bulk undeletions) &ndash;\
      \ <code>http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/cgi-bin/images-restore.cgi</code>. We do\
      \ have image revisions, but the \"delete image\" feature is more more like the\
      \ \"delete page\" feature than anything else &ndash; it'd be pointless to delete\
      \ images in a way that leaves them accessible.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Good to know.\
      \ I've restored some of the deleted images.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I just deleted\
      \ about 75 pages created by spambots and reverted a few more pages. All of them\
      \ had \"display<code>:</code> none\" spam on them.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Seems like\
      \ the fix [http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki?action=browse&diff=1&id=Mod_Ideas%2FNukeRifles&revision=16&diffrevision=15\
      \ didn't work]...\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Seems so.  I'm going to add some debug\
      \ code in the hope to find out what exactly is submitted next time.\n\n'''MythOpus:'''\
      \ How does the redirection work?  Does it do it with the browser (i.e. meta\
      \ redirect stuff) or does it do it some other way.  I would think that if you\
      \ were using the browser to redirect and the bot wasn't using an actual 'browser'\
      \ then redirection wouldn't work on it.  And I'm sure if you created a custom\
      \ browser that you could bypass most anything.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Redirection\
      \ means that instead of saving the page and sending it as response, a HTTP redirect\
      \ to the [[Legacy:Chongqing Page|Chongqing Page]] is send and nothing is saved.\
      \ However, it seems that the spam detection script no longer works: some spambots\
      \ just replaced several pages with a lot of links.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Site is\
      \ locked for now as bots are still active.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Small wonder our\
      \ locks, spam filters etc. didn't do anything:  The spammers were posting to\
      \ <code>wiki-umw.cgi</code> rather than <code>wiki.cgi</code>.  I've disabled\
      \ that possibility. &ndash; Now that leaves me with the question how <code>wiki-umw.cgi</code>\
      \ got there... does anybody remember putting it there?\n\n'''Wormbo:''' We just\
      \ gota new lower-case named page. Anyone care to investigate? *bump*\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Attempting to create a lowercase page should send you to the New Contributors\
      \ page, same as if you try to save a new page without editing the default text.\n\
      \n'''Wormbo:''' Site locked again after multiple bots bombed three pages with\
      \ similar spam links: http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki?action=history&id=ScratchPad\n\
      \n'''MythOpus:''' I just became aware(been clueless for awhile apparently) that\
      \ you can use direct javascript in IE (and most likely in other browsers) as\
      \ in you can type JavaScript into the URL box and it'll run as if it were on\
      \ your current site.  Somehow related to bots and bypassing the security measures?\n\
      \n'''Wormbo:''' Spammers seem to bypass the filters once again.\n\n==Orphan\
      \ Pages==\n\n'''Fyfe:''' Is there any way to check the wiki for orphaned pages??\
      \ (orphaned page = pages that aren't linked to by an other page)\n\n'''Wormbo:'''\
      \ Try clicking on the page title.\n\n==Bots that mess up pages==\n\n'''Wormbo:'''\
      \ Recently there seem to be some bots that cut off page content at the first\
      \ semicolon and replace plus signs with spaces. Basically they behave like they\
      \ never heard of URL encoding. Can this somehow be blocked? What about a Captcha\
      \ for users without a user name?\n\n==Liandri Archives==\n\n'''Wormbo:''' I\
      \ think we should take advantage of the other BU-hoste wiki, Liandri Archives,\
      \ and link general non-development articles there instead of duplicating content\
      \ here. This goes especially for pages like [[Legacy:Unreal Tournament 3|Unreal\
      \ Tournament 3]], where stuff like vehicle information should be left to Liandri\
      \ Archives while we supply details about the dev tools and features related\
      \ to modding.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:MetaTopics|MetaTopics]]\n**\
