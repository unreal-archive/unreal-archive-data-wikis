      \ Do</a></p>\n<p>This page is intended for beginners and is meant to be in <u>plain\
      \ english</u> and adopts a learn by doing strategy. No time will be wasted explaining\
      \ why you're doing anything or try to get you to understand abstract concepts\
      \ like the Unreal world being like a lump of clay or something. This document\
      \ is intended to represent the current build, and should be updated accordingly.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> This page will be replaced by the <a href=\"/Legacy:Mapping_Lessons\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mapping Lessons\">Mapping Lessons</a> sequence. I don't see\
      \ what it does differently. If you don't like the conceptual explanations you\
      \ can skip those sections: the idea is that conceptual stuff goes in 'Overview'\
      \ and 'In more depth' sections.</p>\n<p><b>Musicalglass:</b> The only difference\
      \ is I have tried to make a simple beginner's tutorial which any child can understand.\
      \ Even if all the rest of the site is in Wiki shorthand, I think at the very\
      \ least the beginner's tutorial should be in straightforward language. Once\
      \ they have grasped the basics, all the rest of the Wiki terminology makes a\
      \ lot more sense. People think differently, you've said so yourself. Some people\
      \ think in graphic terms, while others are more technical. I'm a more graphic\
      \ thinker. When I try to read some of the technical pages here, they turn into\
      \ a bunch of swimming text like a Matrix screen. Just tell me the basic stuff\
      \ in basic language, then I'll be fine. A few all-in-one tutorials don't negate\
      \ the need for basic procedure pages. I'm just trying to streamline the parts\
      \ of the Wiki I found confusing when I was first trying to learn Unreal.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> I see where you're going with this. But I really would like\
      \ the Mapping Lessons sequence to work for <i>everybody</i>. Perhaps you could\
      \ mark the places that go Matrixy on you so we could try to improve them&#160;:)</p>\n\

      <p>OK let's save our map. Note how you didn't have to save before testing your\
      \ map. Unreal automatically saves it as a temp file. Although it's certainly\
      \ a good idea to save frequently. If you're used to saving your files in My\
      \ Documents or wherever, forget about that for now. You may have noticed how\
      \ Unreal didn't install in the Program Files folder like most applications,\
      \ but rather on your root drive. On a PC, most likely C:\\UT2003.</p>\n<p>That\
      \ is because all the maps and textures, etc. are stored in folders in the same\
      \ folder as the application itself, and we shall do the same with our file.</p>\n\
      <p>Go to File / Save As and you should be taken by default to the Maps folder\

    text: "'''This page is to be folded into [[Legacy:Subtract A Space|Subtract A\
      \ Space]].'''\n\n[[:Category:Legacy To Do]]\n\nThis page is intended for beginners\
      \ and is meant to be in <u>plain english</u> and adopts a learn by doing strategy.\
      \ No time will be wasted explaining why you're doing anything or try to get\
      \ you to understand abstract concepts like the Unreal world being like a lump\
      \ of clay or something. This document is intended to represent the current build,\
      \ and should be updated accordingly.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' This page will be replaced\
      \ by the [[Legacy:Mapping Lessons|Mapping Lessons]] sequence. I don't see what\
      \ it does differently. If you don't like the conceptual explanations you can\
      \ skip those sections: the idea is that conceptual stuff goes in 'Overview'\
      \ and 'In more depth' sections. \n\n'''Musicalglass:''' The only difference\
      \ is I have tried to make a simple beginner's tutorial which any child can understand.\
      \ Even if all the rest of the site is in Wiki shorthand, I think at the very\
      \ least the beginner's tutorial should be in straightforward language. Once\
      \ they have grasped the basics, all the rest of the Wiki terminology makes a\
      \ lot more sense. People think differently, you've said so yourself. Some people\
      \ think in graphic terms, while others are more technical. I'm a more graphic\
      \ thinker. When I try to read some of the technical pages here, they turn into\
      \ a bunch of swimming text like a Matrix screen. Just tell me the basic stuff\
      \ in basic language, then I'll be fine. A few all-in-one tutorials don't negate\
      \ the need for basic procedure pages. I'm just trying to streamline the parts\
      \ of the Wiki I found confusing when I was first trying to learn Unreal.\n\n\
      '''Tarquin:''' I see where you're going with this. But I really would like the\
      \ Mapping Lessons sequence to work for ''everybody''. Perhaps you could mark\
      \ the places that go Matrixy on you so we could try to improve them :)\n\n----\n\
      \n==Where to go next ==\n\ncheck out [[Legacy:Topics On Mapping|Topics on Mapping]]\
      \ for a more in depth listing of tutorials.\n\nor [[:Category:Legacy Tutorial]]\n\
      \n----\n\n==Create a Room ==\n\nFirst we will build a room, then view that room\
      \ in the actual game. Simple!\n\nLaunch Unreal Editor. Close the default Textures\
      \ window to get it out of the way.   or\n\nIf you've been playing around and\
      \ need to start a fresh map, do [[Legacy:UnrealEd Main Menu|UnrealEd Main Menu]]\
      \  -> File -> New \n\n===Add a Builder Brush ===\n\nDown the left side is a\
      \ bunch of buttons known as the [[Legacy:Toolbox|Toolbox]]. \n\nLeft click on\
      \ the Cube Builder button. (The first button that looks like a cube)\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface.toolbox.defbuilders.gif|]]\n\
      \nA red wireframe cube appears in your scene, this is known as the [[Legacy:Red\
      \ Builder Brush|Red Builder Brush]]\n\nNow this time right click the Cube Builder\
      \ button. The CubeBuilder properties window opens.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface-Ed3-CubeBuilder.png|]]\n\
      \nWhere it says Height, left click one time on the number 256. It becomes highlighted.\n\
      \nEnter a new value of 512, then hit the Tab key.\n\nThe Width field becomes\
      \ highlighted. Type 512, Tab, 1024, Tab.\n\nNow click on the Build button. The\
      \ Red Builder Brush changes size.\n\nClose the CubeBuilder window.\n\nYou can\
      \ see your new rectangular cube in 3 of the UnrealEd Viewports. Note in the\
      \ top left corner of each viewport that they represent the Top, Front and Right\
      \ orthogonal views.\n\n===Navigating in the Viewports ===\n\nIn the Perspective\
      \ window which should be black and say Dynamic Light at the moment, right drag\
      \ your mouse around in the window. The view rotates around the camera's center.\n\
      \nRight drag left and right to rotate the camera around in a circle.\n\nRight\
      \ drag forward and back to rotate the camera up and down.\n\nPosition the camera\
      \ so it is facing your cube.\n\nNow left drag the mouse forward and back. The\
      \ camera dollies in and out. Note that left dragging the mouse from side to\
      \ side still rotates the camera around in a circle just as before, only somewhat\
      \ slower.\n\nNow hold both the left and right mouse buttons at the same time\
      \ and move the mouse forward and back. The camera dollies straight up and down\n\
      \nTry to position yourself in the center of the cube.\n\nFor practice, navigate\
      \ somewhere way outside the box and try to see how fast you can get centered\
      \ in the exact middle to where you can rotate the camera around and see equally\
      \ in all directions.\n\nNavigating in the Orthogonal viewports is similar only\
      \ you can't rotate. To move around, left click and drag around. To zoom in and\
      \ out, hold both the left and right mouse buttons and move the mouse up and\
      \ down. If you have a mouse with a wheel you can also use that to zoom.\n\n\
      ===Subtract a Space ===\n\nClick on the Subtract button. (Button #2) to [[Legacy:Subtract\
      \ A Space|Subtract A Space]].\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface.toolbox.BrushOperations.png|]]\n\
      \nYour Builder Brush creates a hollow room with a default bubbly texture.\n\n\
      [[Image:Legacy_interface-Ed3-Subtract.png|]]\n\nNow left click on one of the\
      \ walls inside your room. Note how it becomes blue indicating that it is highlighted.\
      \ Select another wall. The previous wall becomes deselected.\n\n===Add a Light\
      \ ===\n\nNow rotate the camera up to look at the ceiling (right drag forward).\
      \ Click on the ceiling once to select it.\n\nNow hold the L key and right click.\
      \ A light is added to your scene.\n\n===Add a Player Start ===\n\nNow rotate\
      \ the camera down and right click on the floor. From the submenu select Add\
      \ Player Start. A joystick icon appears indicating the default location your\
      \ character will spawn into the Map.\n\n===Build All===\n\nClick on the Build\
      \ All button to render your scene. (Button #6 in the Build category)\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface.toolbar.png|]]\n\
      \n===Play Map! ===\n\nClick on the Play Map button (#8, looks like a joystick)\
      \ and UnrealEd automatically loads and plays the map in UT2003. After you're\
      \ done oohing and ahhing over your creation, hit Esc to exit and Quit Unreal,\
      \ you should now be returned to your operating system. Return to Unreal Editor.\
      \ (On Windows just click on the Unreal button in your Windows menu bar at the\
      \ bottom of the screen.)\n\nThat's It! Welcome to the Unreal world! :-D\n\n\
      ----\n\n==Save your Map ==\n\nOK let's save our map. Note how you didn't have\
      \ to save before testing your map. Unreal automatically saves it as a temp file.\
      \ Although it's certainly a good idea to save frequently. If you're used to\
      \ saving your files in My Documents or wherever, forget about that for now.\
      \ You may have noticed how Unreal didn't install in the Program Files folder\
      \ like most applications, but rather on your root drive. On a PC, most likely\
      \ C:\\UT2003.\n\nThat is because all the maps and textures, etc. are stored\
      \ in folders in the same folder as the application itself, and we shall do the\
      \ same with our file.\n\nGo to File / Save As and you should be taken by default\
      \ to the Maps folder in the UT2003 directory.\n\n===Save a Template (optional)===\n\
      \nLet's save our map as \"A Room Template\". From now on whenever you want to\
      \ do another tutorial and you need a basic room to start you can just open up\
      \ your template file. To prevent from accidentally saving over your template,\
      \ let's make it read only. Minimize Unreal and go to your Maps folder, (On Windoze\
      \ that would be Desktop/ My Computer / C: Drive/ UT2003/ Maps) right click on\
      \ \"A Room Template\" and under Properties, select the Read Only dialog.\n\n\
      ----\n\n==Next Lesson ==\n\n[[Legacy:Learn The Tools|Learn the Tools]] - A must-read\
      \ for any beginner. Covers several common misunderstandings.\n\n----\n\n==Where\
      \ to go next ==\n\ncheck out [[Legacy:Topics On Mapping|Topics on Mapping]]\
      \ for a more in depth listing of tutorials.\n\nor [[:Category:Legacy Tutorial]]\n\

      \ plus a few more.\n\n[[Legacy:UnrealEd Interface|UnrealEd Interface]]:  A complete\
