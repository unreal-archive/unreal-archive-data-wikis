      \ that you can not specify default properties in code while using the UnrealEd\

      \ need indeed some work. I imagine it hard to read through it if it's formatted\
      \ this way because it will have always three sections&#160;:per error and then\
      \ does it start again. It would probably help if the background color of an\
      \ error alternates between grey and white (or a&#160;:brighter grey) for each\
      \ error so that you can better distinguish sections.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>And\
      \ since the number doesn't have any hard reference (unless they are in fact\
      \ internally numbered by the compiler) and is rather unofficial,&#160;:it shouldn't\
      \ be at the left of the box but rather discretely added at the back because\
      \ most people won't use it. Or leave it completely away.&#160;::&gt;</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dd>Another thing I was wondering about was to get a uniform format\
