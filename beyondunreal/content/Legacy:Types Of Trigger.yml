      \ This page seems a bit outdated. Are these triggers from Unreal? UT99?. I'm\
      \ thinkin' that we need to organize this list by game, possibly build, and then\
      \ \"standard\" or \"third-party.\" (Frankly, I think the whole WIKI should be\
      \ devided by Unreal Engine version, Game, build, etc. – but i digress). I'm\
      \ not really sure what proceedure is here. Was thinking of making a \"Types_Of_Trigger_Update_WIP\"\
      \ page while I figure out formatting and general content. Then overwriting this\
      \ page. Then polishing. Your thoughts?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I would suggest\
      \ that we move the contents of this page to <a href=\"/Legacy:Triggers\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Triggers\">Triggers</a>, as a commented list of subclasses. Since we\
      \ need a <a href=\"/Legacy:Triggers\" title=\"Legacy:Triggers\">Triggers</a>\
      \ page for each engine version, there's no problem with the verison split.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Dr.AwkwArD:</b> Ah, good call. Lemme pop over there and see how things\
      \ stand atm.</p>\n<p><b>Dr.AwkwArD:</b> Will move this info over to <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Triggers\" title=\"Legacy:Triggers\">Triggers</a> once organizational\
      \ issues have been more resolved.</p>\n<p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b> I have to\
      \ agree completely with Dr.AwkaArd. Not only should this page be reorganized\
      \ around Unreal Engine version, but this entire Wiki should be. It's kind of\
      \ annoying.</p>\n<p><b>Kamahl:</b> Agreed. I spend ages sorting through junk\

      \ controls a [[Legacy:ScriptedTexture (UT)|ScriptedTexture (UT)]] and allows\
      \ you to switch between different textures displayed on a [[Legacy:Brush|brush]]\

      \ a terminal has been destroyed. (only present in Unreal Tournament)\n\n; TimedTrigger\

      \ This page seems a bit outdated.  Are these triggers from Unreal? UT99?.  I'm\
      \ thinkin' that we need to organize this list by game, possibly build, and then\
      \ \"standard\" or \"third-party.\" (Frankly, I think the whole WIKI should be\
      \ devided by Unreal Engine version, Game, build, etc. &ndash; but i digress).\
      \  I'm not really sure what proceedure is here.  Was thinking of making a \"\
      Types_Of_Trigger_Update_WIP\" page while I figure out formatting and general\
      \ content.  Then overwriting this page.  Then polishing.  Your thoughts?\n\n\
      '''Tarquin:''' I would suggest that we move the contents of this page to [[Legacy:Triggers|Triggers]],\
      \ as a commented list of subclasses. Since we need a [[Legacy:Triggers|Triggers]]\
      \ page for each engine version, there's no problem with the verison split. \n\
      \n'''Dr.AwkwArD:''' Ah, good call.  Lemme pop over there and see how things\
      \ stand atm.\n\n'''Dr.AwkwArD:''' Will move this info over to [[Legacy:Triggers|Triggers]]\
      \ once organizational issues have been more resolved.\n\n'''Bob_The_Beheader:'''\
      \ I have to agree completely with Dr.AwkaArd. Not only should this page be reorganized\
      \ around Unreal Engine version, but this entire Wiki should be. It's kind of\
      \ annoying.\n\n'''Kamahl:''' Agreed.  I spend ages sorting through junk to find\
      \ some \"outdated\" infomation.\n\n----\n\n[[:Category:Legacy Mapping]]\n\n\
