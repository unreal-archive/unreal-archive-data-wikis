      <li>DM-Agony - Sidney \"Clawfist\" Rauchberger has assembled a cool FFA map\
      \ in the style of Codex, but not as cramped. The Shock Rifle is very dangerous\
      \ on this map as many of the floors are long and flat and combo moves are easy\
      \ to do. This map plays well with 6-10 players.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DM-Cybrosis][\

      \ Beware of the new electric trap near the Damage Amplifier! This map plays\

      \ works his ancient temple magic once more. This lovely map plays well with\

      \ made this fantastic Tourney (1 on 1) map. This map will play okay with 6-8\
      \ players but is really meant for one on one play.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DM-Shrapnel][\
      \ - This map was originally released in a free Unreal1 map pack by Epic called\
      \ \"Fusion.\" Cliff Bleszinski has greatly ripped it apart and reworked it so\
      \ that it is less cramped and plays far better. This map plays well with many\
      \ players, from 10 to 16.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DM-HealPod][ - Healpod originally\
      \ shipped with Unreal1. The premise behind the level is that there is no health\
      \ in it, instead, there is a \"pod\" in the center of the level that will restore\
      \ 15 health every second. Now, the level has buttons strategically placed throughout\
      \ it where players can touch them and cause a masher to deploy which will squish\
      \ all who are in the pod at the time. This map plays well with 8-12 players.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DM-Mojo][ - Mojo is a hardcore twisty castle corridor deathmatch\
      \ map by Cliff Bleszinski. It is meant for 6-12 players.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>CTF-Cybrosis][ - Alan Willard's Capture the Flag conversion of DM-Cybrosis][.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li>CTF-Hydro16 - Clawfist has built a top notch \"two bases\"\
      \ industrial style Capture the Flag map. Like all of the other Capture the Flag\
      \ maps in the Bonus Pack plays this map really needs 16 players or more to shine.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li>CTF-Noxion16 - Another great dueling base Capture the Flag\
      \ map courtesy of Clawfist. Needs 16 players for optimal action.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>CTF-Darji16 - Alan Willard started building this map one day and it\
      \ grew into the impressive behmoth that is Darji Fortress. This map is meant\
      \ for 16 players and is quite a challenge to capture the flag in.</li>\n</ul>\n\

      \ relic you will be encased in a green shell briefly to let the attacker know\

      \ - This relic is shaped like a spiked disc, ala \"chaos.\" If you take fatal\
      \ damage while carrying this you will be randomly moved somewhere in the level,\
      \ your health will be restored and you will still have your inventory. Its like\
      \ a second chance.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Relic of Vengeance - Shaped like a\
      \ grinning skull. If you die while carrying this a large skull will appear above\

      \ area.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.023 seconds\n\
