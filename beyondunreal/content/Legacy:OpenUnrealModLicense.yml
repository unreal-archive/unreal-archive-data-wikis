      \ be filled in. Maybe we should also create a lesser OUML that would allow you\
      \ to link to non free stuff (like art assets).</p>\n<p>This is an initiative\
      \ by the modding community. I doubt Epic will even officially support this license\
      \ idea, but would be nice if they did. Oh and let's not make this a discussion\
      \ about having your source available or not. Nobody is forcing you to use this\
      \ to be license.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Interesting&#160;:) By coincidence,\
      \ I was just pondering recently that we should have a standard license for the\
      \ custom class scripts that are posted on the wiki&#160;:) Have you thought\
      \ of looking into the Creative Commons licenses?</p>\n<p><b>Sir_Brizz:</b> Great\
      \ idea...but the name seems...wrong?&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> since\
      \ it's WIP, most things can change, so if you have a better name, let's hear\
      \ it. Haven't read the creative Commons licenses yet.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b>\
      \ well... any comments... (note: the lesser ouml would allow linking to non-free\
      \ work)</p>\n<p><b>pgibbs:</b> Does \"copyright holder\" need defining explicity?</p>\n\
      <p><b>El Muerte:</b> do you think it needs to be? Would be something like: <i>\"\
      copyright holder\" the person, group or company claiming copyright of the work</i></p>\n\
      <p><b>pgibbs:</b> Perhaps: <i>\"copyright holder\" the person, group or company\
      \ claiming copyright of the Program.</i></p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> it can't\
      \ be the Program, because it obstructs with the definition of Program</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mr.Mitchell:</b> Is \"Envoirement\" the correct word? It looks like \"\
      Environment\" was intended, but since it has been written that way 3 times I\
      \ am not so sure.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> argh, yes it's \"environment\",\
      \ for some reason I once had that confused and now it's sticking with me.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Is this ready yet?</p>\n<p><b>luserSPAZ:</b> Maybe this is\
      \ obvious, but if you're going to propose this for widespread use, you should\
      \ really have a lawyer review it first.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> I think it's\
      \ ready enough. Well it would be nice if a lawyer (or somebody else with more\
      \ knowledge than me about this stuff) would look at this, but it's not a requirement.\
      \ If somebody has some lawyer friends, let them take a look at this.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ I noticed one small issue in here - maybe it's a contradiction or maybe it\
      \ just needs clarification. Part 2 suggests that you can copy or distribute\
      \ by any means you see fit, so long as the work is not altered. It further goes\
      \ on to suggest that you are not limited to charging a fee for the service of\
      \ copying, etc. This suggests that you can retail the software to people, as\
      \ the only mentions of charging for the software in section 2 explicitly state\
      \ that you are <i>not limited</i> to charging for the service of distribution\
      \ or warranty.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> Uhm, yes. You could retail it (if you\
      \ where allowed to by the license of the runtime). But keep in mind that everybody\
      \ who get's a copy can distribute it.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU\

      \ \n        exception to translation of this license.\n        \n        This\
      \ license applies to the Program that has been released under this license.\
      \ \n        The license only applies to copying, distribution and modification\
      \ of the \n        Program. Execution or output of the Program are not covered\
      \ by this license, \n        however the right for additional limitations on\
      \ the use (that do not cover \n        copying, distribution or modification)\
      \ is granted to the copyright holder.\n        This license is only valid when\
      \ all terms in this license comply with the \n        licenses of the dependecies\
      \ of the Program. This includes the license of the\n        possible required\
      \ runtime envoirement.\n        \n        2. Copying and distribution\n    \
      \    You are granted to copy or distribute verbatim copies of the Program, on\
      \ any \n        medium, or in any format as you see fit. You are not limited\
      \ to charging a fee \n        for the physical act of transferring the copy,\
      \ nor are you limited to provide \n        warranty for the Program in return\
      \ of a fee. Unless this is prohibited by the\n        license of the Runtime\
      \ Environment.\n        \n        Any distribution of the program should be\
      \ accompanied with a verbatim copy of \n        this license.\n        \n  \
      \      3. Modification\n        You are allowed to modify the Program, or portions\
      \ of it, therefore making it a \n        derivate of the Program. You are allowed\
      \ to distribute your Modification under \n        the following conditions:\n\
      \                - You must clearly state that it is a modification of the Program\n\
      \                - The original copyright notice must be kept intact\n     \
      \           - The modified files must contain notices of the changes made to\
      \ it\n                - The Modification must be released under the same license\
      \ as the Program\n                - Distribution happens in compliance with\
      \ section 2\n        \n        4. Source\n        The original source of the\
      \ Program or Modification must be freely available on \n        request.\n \
      \       \n        5. Linking\n        The Program or Modification may only link\
      \ with other work that have been \n        released as free software.\n    \
      \    \n        The license grants exclusive right to link with any non-free\
      \ part of the \n        Runtime Environment, as provided by the publisher or\
      \ creator of said Runtime \n        Environment. \n        Using addapted portions\
      \ of source code available in the runtime environment \n        in the Program\
      \ is only allowed under the following terms:\n                - the addapted\
      \ code is clearly marked to originate from the runtime\n                  environment,\
      \ quoting the original copyright.\n                - the following notice is\
      \ added to the top of the file:\n                  \"This file contains portions\
      \ of code from the runtime environment.\"\n        \n        6. NON WARRANTY\n\
      \        THIS SOFTWARE DOES NOT COME WITH A WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, UNLESS NOTED\
      \ OTHERWISE \n        BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR WARRANTY PROVIDER. THE ENTIRE\
      \ RISK OF THE PERFORMANCE \n        AND QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM LIES WITH YOU.\
      \ SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, \n        YOU WILL ASSUME ALL COSTS FOR\
      \ REQUIRED REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n==How to use==\n\nWhen you want to release\
      \ your mod under this license you have to include the above license with your\
      \ mod and add the following to every source file:\n\n    <name of the program>\n\
      \    Copyright (C) <year(s) of completion> <name of author>\n    \n    This\
      \ program is free software; you can redistribute and/or modify \n    it under\
      \ the terms of the Open Unreal Mod License version 1.1.\n\n'''Important note'''\n\
      \nIf you release your whole mod under this license it will also cover all other\
      \ assets like maps, meshes, etc. If you do not want this you can dual license\
      \ your mod (e.g. the code released under this license and the maps under an\
      \ other \"free\" license). But be aware of the linking restrictions of this\
      \ license.\n\n==FAQ==\n\n===When does linking create a direct dependency?===\n\
      \nWhen you hard code references to an object or asset, it will be a direct dependency.\
      \ Using [[Legacy:DynamicLoadObject|DynamicLoadObject]] does not have to result\
      \ in a direct dependency.\n\nThe question to be ansered is: will the program\
      \ run without the dependency? If the answer is yes, it's not a direct dependency.\n\
      \n==Other versions==\n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Version 1.0]] -\
      \ deprecated\n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Version 1.1]] - current\n\
      \n==Related pages==\n\n* [[Legacy:LesserOpenUnrealModLicense|LesserOpenUnrealModLicense]]\
      \ - Similar license, this one allows linking with non-free work\n* [[Legacy:Open\
      \ Source|Open Source]]\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''El Muerte:''' initial start,\
      \ license needs to be filled in. Maybe we should also create a lesser OUML that\
      \ would allow you to link to non free stuff (like art assets).\n\nThis is an\
      \ initiative by the modding community. I doubt Epic will even officially support\
      \ this license idea, but would be nice if they did. Oh and let's not make this\
      \ a discussion about having your source available or not. Nobody is forcing\
      \ you to use this to be license.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Interesting :) By coincidence,\
      \ I was just pondering recently that we should have a standard license for the\
      \ custom class scripts that are posted on the wiki :) Have you thought of looking\
      \ into the Creative Commons licenses?\n\n'''Sir_Brizz:''' Great idea...but the\
      \ name seems...wrong? :)\n\n'''El Muerte:''' since it's WIP, most things can\
      \ change, so if you have a better name, let's hear it. Haven't read the creative\
      \ Commons licenses yet. \n\n'''El Muerte:''' well... any comments... (note:\
      \ the lesser ouml would allow linking to non-free work)\n\n'''pgibbs:''' Does\
      \ \"copyright holder\" need defining explicity?\n\n'''El Muerte:''' do you think\
      \ it needs to be? Would be something like: ''\"copyright holder\"    the person,\
      \ group or company claiming copyright of the work''\n\n'''pgibbs:''' Perhaps:\
      \ ''\"copyright holder\"    the person, group or company claiming copyright\
      \ of the Program.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' it can't be the Program, because it obstructs\
      \ with the definition of Program\n\n'''Mr.Mitchell:''' Is \"Envoirement\" the\
      \ correct word? It looks like \"Environment\" was intended, but since it has\
      \ been written that way 3 times I am not so sure.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' argh,\
      \ yes it's \"environment\", for some reason I once had that confused and now\
      \ it's sticking with me.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Is this ready yet?\n\n'''luserSPAZ:'''\
      \ Maybe this is obvious, but if you're going to propose this for widespread\
      \ use, you should really have a lawyer review it first.\n\n'''El Muerte:'''\
      \ I think it's ready enough. Well it would be nice if a lawyer (or somebody\
      \ else with more knowledge than me about this stuff) would look at this, but\
      \ it's not a requirement. If somebody has some lawyer friends, let them take\
      \ a look at this.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I noticed one small issue in here - maybe\
      \ it's a contradiction or maybe it just needs clarification. Part 2 suggests\
      \ that you can copy or distribute by any means you see fit, so long as the work\
      \ is not altered. It further goes on to suggest that you are not limited to\
      \ charging a fee for the service of copying, etc. This suggests that you can\
      \ retail the software to people, as the only mentions of charging for the software\
      \ in section 2 explicitly state that you are ''not limited''  to charging for\
      \ the service of distribution or warranty.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' Uhm, yes. You\
      \ could retail it (if you where allowed to by the license of the runtime). But\
      \ keep in mind that everybody who get's a copy can distribute it."
