      <p>A fast way to test overall botplay is by spectating bot-only games. While\
      \ spectating, you can use the <a href=\"/Legacy:ShowDebug\" title=\"Legacy:ShowDebug\"\
      >ShowDebug</a> console command to help see how the bots are performing and how\
      \ they percieve the environment. By testing with a single bot, you can see how\
      \ bots react to your layout and path network. This method is used to makes sure\
      \ bots use the entire layout consistently. This is also a good way to find out\
      \ why bots regularly get stuck in particular places. By testing with multiple\
      \ bots, the mapper is able to test more complex issues such as combat effectiveness,\
      \ proper use of multiple AssaultPaths, and AIscipts.</p>\n<p><i>Incidentally,\
      \ spectating a bot-only game with the maximum number of recommended players\
      \ is one of the best ways to judge your map's overall Framerate performance,\
      \ and to find spots with less than consistent performance.</i></p>\n<h2><span\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Sometimes you need a bot to test a very specifc thing.\
      \ Rather than watching a bot-only game until the bot happens to try it, a mapper\
      \ should start a Teamgame of some kind (Team Deathmatch, for example), and using\
      \ bot orders, command a Teammate to try the test. For example, navigation up\
      \ a ladder can be tested by calling a Teammate, <i>(\"Cover Me.\")</i>, having\
      \ them wait, <i>(\"Hold this position.\")</i>, while you climb the ladder and\
      \ get off it. Then, test by calling the Teammate again. This method works best\
      \ in larger maps where a single bot on the opposing team won't easily interfere\
      \ with testing.</p>\n<p><b>Unknown:</b> Alternately, you could disable \"balance\
      \ teams\" and \"random order\" in the practice session dialog and then manually\
      \ assign the only bot to your team.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> I don't think those\

      \ bot isn't currently covering or following, the bot may not know which position\
      \ to hold. A bot will hold the position loosely, leaving occasionally to fight\

      \ control the game environment with respect to bots.\n; [[Legacy:ShowDebug|ShowDebug]]\
      \ : This toggling console command causes several objects related to Controller,\
      \ Pawn, Bot and Weapon status to report information on the screen as colorful\
      \ readouts.  While spectating a bot-only game, you may switch to a bot to see\
      \ how the bot is acting and what it is acting upon.\n; showai : A subset of\
      \ the above. Spectate a bot, and it should plot out their currently planned\
      \ route through the pathfinding network.\n; addbots <number> : Any number of\
      \ bots can be added to the map. (In UT200x, there is a maximum limit in most\
      \ gametypes, 32.  Any gametype that hasn't been specifically modified to accept\
      \ more bots will have this limit.)\n; killall bot : This is a specific application\
      \ of the killall command to remove all bots.  In some games, this will result\
      \ in a win and end the map.\n; set TeamGame bAdjustSkill 1 : This is a resetting\
      \ of a TeamGame variable using the set command.  It will allow the skill level\
      \ of bots in Team Games to rise and fall, depending on how you, as the player,\
      \ do against them.  You die by their hands: the skill level goes down, you kill\
      \ many bots: skill level goes up.  This function will fluctuate more during\
      \ the start of a map and settle on an appropriate skill level for the player\
      \ on that map, because it is based on a ratio of kills to deaths.  While this\
      \ setting is available in the UT2003 menu, it has been disabled in some UT2004\
      \ teamgames, and this console command must be used instead.\n; soakbots : This\
      \ will display detailed information about botplay, in particular whatever bot\
      \ you are viewing at a given time.  If the bots encounter an AI error of any\
      \ sort, like if it can't reach a desired navigation point, the game will instantly\
      \ freeze and the camera view will snap to the offending bot.  Relevant data\
      \ will be displayed on screen.  You can hit any key to restart gameplay, but\
      \ the only currently known way to end soakbot data is to end the match.\n; ReviewJumpSpots\
      \ : Exhaustively, automatically tests the jump spots; see [[Legacy:Console Commands/Debugging\
      \ Console Commands|Console Commands/Debugging Console Commands]]. Using this\
      \ with \"slomo 0.5\" or so helps to see where things are going wrong.<br />'''Note:'''\
      \ For this command to work correctly, you need to be a player (not a spectator)\
      \ and you should not yet have clicked to start the game. If a failed hazardous\
      \ jump kills the bot, it does not respawn to continue the test.\n\n==Related\

      \ lists the tools you need to test the bots, while the other lists the reasons\

      \ 2Kx only? i know i've added huge numbers of bots in original UT without problems.\n\
      \n'''SuperApe:''' It's a UT200x limitation.\n\n'''hellion Zero:''' is there\
      \ any known way around this limit!?!?\n\n'''hellion Zero:''' i hear that replication\
      \ is part of the problem\n\n'''Wormbo:''' It's about CPU usage and network bandwidth.\
      \ There are only some servers that can technically handle 32 human players,\
      \ and bots demand even more CPU power.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n\
