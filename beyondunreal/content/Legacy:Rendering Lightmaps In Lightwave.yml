      \ (or read in <a href=\"/Legacy:The_Curse_Of_Static_Meshes\" title=\"Legacy:The\
      \ Curse Of Static Meshes\">The Curse of Static Meshes</a>) that static mesh\
      \ lighting is not very good in Unreal Tournament. To a certain extent this can\
      \ be improved by tweaking the design of the static mesh (presumably by increasing\
      \ the number of points in the mesh – since vertex lighting is used – and/or\
      \ by creating more uniformly shaped polygons – long thin triangles seem to result\
      \ in particularly bad lighting). However, often the only solution is to create\
      \ your own lighting off-line (by rendering the object in Lightwave) and then\
      \ to overlay it on the static mesh.</p>\n<p>This section concerns creating your\
      \ own lightmap in Lightwave, with particular emphasis on the steps needed to\
      \ get the resulting lightmap overlaid on your static mesh in the Unreal Tournament\
