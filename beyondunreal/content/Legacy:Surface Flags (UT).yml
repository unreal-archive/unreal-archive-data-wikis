  text:
    text: "<p>Every surface in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Unreal_Geometry\" title=\"Legacy:Unreal\
      \ Geometry\">Unreal Geometry</a> has a list of flags, which set different types\
      \ of behaviour. These are accessed in the <b>Flags</b> tab of the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Surface_Properties_Window\" title=\"Legacy:Surface Properties Window\"\
      >Surface Properties window</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"\

      \ in a 3D <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Viewport\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport\"\
      >UnrealEd Viewport</a>. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Selecting_Surfaces\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Selecting Surfaces\">Selecting surfaces</a> for shortcuts and key combinations.</li>\n\
      <li>click this <a href=\"/Legacy:Toolbar\" title=\"Legacy:Toolbar\">toolbar</a>\
      \ button to open the Surface Properties window. (alternatives: <b>F5</b>, or\
      \ through the main menu).</li>\n<li>the title bar displays the number of selected\
      \ surfaces. The name of the texture applied to those surfaces is displayed (unless\
      \ several surfaces have different textures).</li>\n<li>the window has three\
      \ tabs. A UnrealEd bug sometimes makes these sticky. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Alignment\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Surface Alignment\">Surface Alignment</a> for information about\
      \ the alignment tab.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Basically if you want a condition to apply\
      \ to your surface you will put a check next to it while your surface is <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Selecting_Surfaces\" title=\"Legacy:Selecting Surfaces\">selected</a>.\
      \ If another surface is selected, the check boxes update to display information\
      \ about the new selection.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush\" title=\"Legacy:Brush\"\
      >brush</a>'s <a href=\"/Legacy:PolyFlags\" title=\"Legacy:PolyFlags\">PolyFlags</a>\
      \ property can override the flags of all the surfaces associated to it. These\
      \ can be set manually, or when creating the brush with the <a href=\"/Legacy:Add_Special\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Add Special\">Add Special</a> window.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Invisible</dt>\n\
      <dd>The texture will be invisible. For example, the surfaces of <a href=\"/Legacy:Zone_Portal\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Zone Portal\">zone portals</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:Invisible_Collision_Hull\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Invisible Collision Hull\">invisible collision hulls</a> are\
      \ invisible. These surfaces are displayed in UnrealEd unless <a href=\"/Legacy:Realtime_Preview\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Realtime Preview\">realtime preview</a> is enabled in the viewport's\
      \ titlebar.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Masked</dt>\n<dd>See <a href=\"/Legacy:Color_Blending\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Color Blending\">color blending</a>. You see masked textures\
      \ as fences, grates, chains, etc. If a <i>texture</i> has been created as masked,\
      \ then this flag isn't necessary: the masking effect is \"built-in\". Some textures\
      \ however will need this flag to make black parts transparent. Note that if\
      \ you have a texture that is masked, it will be rendered after everything else.\
      \ This means that gibs, weapons and players etc, will be rendered even if they\
      \ are obscured by a masked texture. This has a severe effect on framerate, so\
      \ go easy on the masked textures!</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Translucent</dt>\n\
      <dd>See <a href=\"/Legacy:Color_Blending\" title=\"Legacy:Color Blending\">color\
      \ blending</a>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Force View Zone</dt>\n<dd>Render the\
      \ poly regardless of its zone mapping. During the zone mapping process, polys\
      \ will sometimes be flagged as part of Zone 0, causing them to be invisible\
      \ when the player is within the level. Level designers can detect this class\
      \ of hole by moving \"into geometry\" (i.e., outside the level) while viewing\
      \ the level from an editor window set to \"Zone/Portal View.\" If the hole is\
      \ replaced by a polygon colored unlike the rest of the polygons in the zone\
      \ (usually dark gray), the \"hole\" can usually be patched by setting the PF_ForceViewZone\
      \ flag. The patch can immediately be verified by moving inside the level.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Modulated</dt>\n<dd>See <a href=\"/Legacy:Color_Blending\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Color Blending\">color blending</a>. Some textures are designed\
      \ specifically to work with this flag: they appear in greyscale in the browser;\
      \ for instance the water ripple texture HubEffects.WaterRings2. See <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Making_Waterfalls\" title=\"Legacy:Making Waterfalls\">Making Waterfalls</a>\

      <dd>If you both check translucent and modulated, you will have a low translucency\
      \ effect</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Fake Backdrop</dt>\n<dd>Links the texture to\
      \ the SkyZone actor. When looking into a Fake Backdrop texture you will see\
      \ what the Skyzone actor sees. Less technical meaning is it is used to create\
      \ the background <a href=\"/Legacy:SkyBox\" title=\"Legacy:SkyBox\">SkyBox</a>\
      \ texture visible in a level. Examples: a window or the ceiling of an outdoor\
      \ area.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Two Sided</dt>\n<dd>The texture will be two sided.\
      \ Mainly used for sheets and <a href=\"/Legacy:Nonsolid\" title=\"Legacy:Nonsolid\"\
      >Nonsolid</a> objects. For example, if you have a cube that is non-solid you\
      \ will see its textures from the outside and it will look like a normal cube.\
      \ If you move inside of it you won't see the inside walls of the cube. Setting\
      \ the 2 sided flag on those surfaces will allow you to see the inside walls\
      \ of the cube. Both sides of the wall (outside and inside) well be the same\
      \ texture and alignment. There is no way to have a different texture per side.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>U-Pan, V-Pan</dt>\n<dd>Texture will pan along the u-axis (horizontal)\
      \ or the v-axis (vertical) respectively. These axes are relative to the texture,\
      \ so are dependant on how it's been rotated, scaled of skewed. The panning speed\
      \ is set for the whole zone the surface belongs to in the <a href=\"/Legacy:ZoneInfo\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:ZoneInfo\">ZoneInfo</a> actor's TexUPanSpeed and TexVPanSpeed\
      \ properties. Good for flowing water, clouds in the <a href=\"/Legacy:SkyBox\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:SkyBox\">SkyBox</a>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>High Shadow Detail</dt>\n\
      <dd>Makes shadows on the texture more defined with less fuzzy edges by increasing\
      \ the light map resolution. Also makes the scene a little slower when dynamic\
      \ lights are present, Like those caused by weapon fire.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dt>Low Shadow Detail</dt>\n<dd>Makes shadows less defined and more fuzzy on\

      \ lights are present.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt><i>Ultra Low Shadow Detail</i>&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>One of those hidden hacky secret options: if both Low and High Shadow Detail\
      \ are set then the texture will have Ultra Low Shadow Detail.</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>No Smooth</dt>\n<dd>Turns off all texture filtering and smoothing\

      \ Often used for water but looks ugly when done this way. This is kinda like\

      <dd>Makes the texture more responsive to light which make the over all texture\
      \ brighter including the edges and corners. Also helps to illuminate smaller\
      \ textures that aren't responding to normal lightmapping. If you have a texture\
      \ that keeps coming out black then try setting this.<br />\nThis is useful when\
      \ you have a large surface that is unevenly lit. Enabling this will ensure that\
      \ all parts are smoothly lit, looking more natural and that there are no dark\
      \ corners</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Special Lit</dt>\n<dd>Texture will only be\

      \ source in this case.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>No Bounds Reject</dt>\n<dd>Poly-specific\
      \ disabling of bound rejection. Failure of the bound rejection code below causes\
      \ holes that appear and disappear as you move around the polygon. Flagging the\
      \ polygon (or in some cases, several adjacent polygons as well) with PF_NoBoundRejection\
      \ will eliminate this problem. To verify that the polygon in question is suffering\
      \ from this problem, select all surfaces, then toggle the flag. The missing\
      \ polygon should appear when \"No Bound Rejection\" is flagged. This is mainly\
      \ a band aid fix to what is really causing the problem.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dt>Unlit</dt>\n<dd>The surface will not be affected by the lighting process.\
      \ It will show at full brightness, ie it will show the same in Textured view,\
      \ in Dynamic Light view and in-game. Useful for textures that look like light\
      \ sources.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Portal</dt>\n<dd>Makes the surface a <a href=\"\

  wikitext:
    text: "Every surface in the [[Legacy:Unreal Geometry|Unreal Geometry]] has a list\
      \ of flags, which  set different types of behaviour. These are accessed in the\
      \ '''Flags''' tab of the [[Legacy:Surface Properties Window|Surface Properties\
      \ window]].\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface-surfaceflagstab.png|center|]]\n\n# a\
      \ selected surface in a 3D [[Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport|UnrealEd Viewport]]. See\
      \ [[Legacy:Selecting Surfaces|Selecting surfaces]] for shortcuts and key combinations.\n\
      # click this [[Legacy:Toolbar|toolbar]] button to open the Surface Properties\
      \ window. (alternatives: '''F5''', or through the main menu). \n# the title\
      \ bar displays the number of selected surfaces. The name of the texture applied\
      \ to those surfaces is displayed (unless several surfaces have different textures).\n\
      # the window has three tabs. A UnrealEd bug sometimes makes these sticky. See\
      \ [[Legacy:Surface Alignment|Surface Alignment]] for information about the alignment\
      \ tab.\n\nBasically if you want a condition to apply to your surface you will\
      \ put a check next to it while your surface is [[Legacy:Selecting Surfaces|selected]].\
      \ If another surface is selected, the check boxes update to display information\
      \ about the new selection.\n\nA [[Legacy:Brush|brush]]'s [[Legacy:PolyFlags|PolyFlags]]\
      \ property can override the flags of all the surfaces associated to it. These\
      \ can be set manually, or when creating the brush with the [[Legacy:Add Special|Add\
      \ Special]] window.\n\n;Invisible: The texture will be invisible. For example,\
      \ the surfaces of [[Legacy:Zone Portal|zone portal]]s and [[Legacy:Invisible\
      \ Collision Hull|invisible collision hull]]s are invisible. These surfaces are\
      \ displayed in UnrealEd unless [[Legacy:Realtime Preview|realtime preview]]\
      \ is enabled in the viewport's titlebar.\n\n;Masked: See [[Legacy:Color Blending|color\
      \ blending]]. You see masked textures as fences, grates, chains, etc. If a ''texture''\
      \ has been created as masked, then this flag isn't necessary: the masking effect\
      \ is \"built-in\". Some textures however will need this flag to make black parts\
      \ transparent. Note that if you have a texture that is masked, it will be rendered\
      \ after everything else. This means that gibs, weapons and players etc, will\
      \ be rendered even if they are obscured by a masked texture. This has a severe\
      \ effect on framerate, so go easy on the masked textures!\n\n;Translucent: See\
      \ [[Legacy:Color Blending|color blending]].\n\n;Force View Zone: Render the\
      \ poly regardless of its zone mapping. During the zone mapping process, polys\
      \ will sometimes be flagged as part of Zone 0, causing them to be invisible\
      \ when the player is within the level. Level designers can detect this class\
      \ of hole by moving \"into geometry\" (i.e., outside the level) while viewing\
      \ the level from an editor window set to \"Zone/Portal View.\" If the hole is\
      \ replaced by a polygon colored unlike the rest of the polygons in the zone\
      \ (usually dark gray), the \"hole\" can usually be patched by setting the PF_ForceViewZone\
      \ flag. The patch can immediately be verified by moving inside the level. \n\
      \n;Modulated: See [[Legacy:Color Blending|color blending]].  Some textures are\
      \ designed specifically to work with this flag: they appear in greyscale in\
      \ the browser; for instance the water ripple texture HubEffects.WaterRings2.\
      \ See [[Legacy:Making Waterfalls|Making Waterfalls]] for an example of how to\
      \ use this.\n\n; ''Low Translucency'' : If you both check translucent and modulated,\
      \ you will have a low translucency effect\n\n;Fake Backdrop: Links the texture\
      \ to the SkyZone actor.  When looking into a Fake Backdrop texture you will\
      \ see what the Skyzone actor sees.  Less technical meaning is it is used to\
      \ create the background [[Legacy:SkyBox|SkyBox]] texture visible in a level.\
      \ Examples: a window or the ceiling of an outdoor area.\n\n;Two Sided: The texture\
      \ will be two sided. Mainly used for sheets and [[Legacy:Nonsolid|Nonsolid]]\
      \ objects.  For example, if you have a cube that is non-solid you will see its\
      \ textures from the outside and it will look like a normal cube.  If you move\
      \ inside of it you won't see the inside walls of the cube.  Setting the 2 sided\
      \ flag on those surfaces will allow you to see the inside walls of the cube.\
      \  Both sides of the wall (outside and inside) well be the same texture and\
      \ alignment.  There is no way to have a different texture per side. \n\n;U-Pan,\
      \ V-Pan: Texture will pan along the u-axis (horizontal) or the  v-axis (vertical)\
      \ respectively. These axes are relative to the texture, so are dependant on\
      \ how it's been rotated, scaled of skewed. The panning speed is set for the\
      \ whole zone the surface belongs to in the [[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]] actor's\
      \ TexUPanSpeed and TexVPanSpeed properties.  Good for flowing water, clouds\
      \ in the [[Legacy:SkyBox|SkyBox]]. \n\n;High Shadow Detail: Makes shadows on\
      \ the texture more defined with less fuzzy edges by increasing the light map\
      \ resolution.  Also makes the scene a little slower when dynamic lights are\
      \ present, Like those caused by weapon fire. \n\n;Low Shadow Detail: Makes shadows\
      \ less defined and more fuzzy on the edges.  Decreases lightmap resolution and\
      \ speeds up gameplay when dynamic lights are present.\n\n; ''Ultra Low Shadow\
      \ Detail'' : One of those hidden hacky secret options: if both Low and High\
      \ Shadow Detail are set then the texture will have Ultra Low Shadow Detail.\
      \ \n\n;No Smooth: Turns off all texture filtering and smoothing for the surface.\n\
      \n;Special Poly : Entirely unused in the Engine and without any function.  \n\
      \n;Small Wavy: Makes the texture move around in circles in a wavy fashion. Often\
      \ used for water but looks ugly when done this way. This is kinda like Panning\
      \ except it'll got in all four directions at radom. Good for water in a pool.\n\
      \n; Dirty Shadows : Entirely unused in the Engine and without any function.\n\
      \n;Bright Corners: Makes the texture more responsive to light which make the\
      \ over all texture brighter including the edges and corners. Also helps to illuminate\
      \ smaller textures that aren't responding to normal lightmapping.  If you have\

      \ ensure that all parts are smoothly lit, looking more natural and that there\
      \ are no dark corners\n\n;Special Lit: Texture will only be illuminated by [[Legacy:Light\
      \ (UT)|Light (UT)]]s that are also set to [[Legacy:Special Lit|special lit]].\
      \ <br />Used when you want a surface to be lit independent of light sources\
      \ around it. Example a glowing sphere that is not affected by your lighting\
      \ around it. You need to set up a special light source in this case.\n\n;No\

      \ all surfaces, then toggle the flag. The missing polygon should appear when\
      \ \"No Bound Rejection\" is flagged. This is mainly a band aid fix to what is\
      \ really causing the problem. \n\n;Unlit: The surface will not be affected by\
      \ the lighting process. It will show at full brightness, ie it will show the\
      \ same in Textured view, in Dynamic Light view and in-game. Useful for textures\
      \ that look like light sources.\n\n;Portal: Makes the surface a [[Legacy:Zone\
      \ Portal|Zone Portal]].\n\n;Mirror: The surface will look like a mirror. Make\
      \ sure there is a frame or something as the effect looks very unnatural. Also\
