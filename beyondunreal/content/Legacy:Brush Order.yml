      \ happens, either set the order of the subtractive brush to first to make it\

      \ geometry. To fix some of these, there is a good technique to try once you\
      \ have finished building onto your map. First, simultaneously select all the\
      \ semisolid brushes in the level and order them to last. Then do this again\
      \ with all nonsolids, and finally with all movers. Rebuild afterwards. In this\
      \ way, you'll have the brushes ordered in such a way as to never create conflicts,\
