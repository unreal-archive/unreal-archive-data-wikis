    text: "<p>Mapping for DeathMatch couldn't be easier. They can be a lot of fun\
      \ to make. They allow you a lot of freedom because essentially there are no\
      \ \"rules.\" There is really nothing special that has to be put in a DeathMatch\
      \ map. Your first endeavor as a mapper is almost always a DM map, and when you\
      \ make a new map in UnrealEd it defaults to being DM (when you click the joystick\
      \ button to <a href=\"/Legacy:Playtest\" title=\"Legacy:Playtest\">Playtest</a>\
      \ the map).</p>\n<p>However, there are some ingredients that you need to have\

      >Map Flow</a> above all else. You have to be able to get from one place to another\
      \ very easily. And what's more you've got to have several options. UnrealTournament's\
      \ <i>DM-Tempest</i> has brilliant flow as does <i>DM-Malevolence.</i> They are\
      \ almost open ended but not at all confusing to navigate. The reason is that\
      \ no two places look the same so you can tell where you are. This is why a symmetrical\
      \ map is bad in DM in my opinion. Another thing with flow you might want to\
      \ consider is the fact that you might want doors and other movers in the way\
      \ with switches to open them for all the nice detail but it really can ruin\
      \ the flow if you want to get to the next room in a small amount of time and\
      \ get fragged because you were finding the switch. But all the flow really depends\
      \ on the type of deathmatch map you want to create; you can make the map that\
      \ is more realistic and actually takes an environment and makes it a killing\
      \ field, or you can make the arena style like DM-Fractal where you must focus\
      \ your flow on keeping the possiblity of fragging from every angle all while\
      \ maintaining a fast paced match.</p>\n<p>Flow should dictate architecture.\
      \ Build you details around the path you have created.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This is the second element. The <a href=\"/Legacy:Z-Axis\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Z-Axis\">Z-axis</a> is essentially part of your flow. You need\
      \ to be able to go up/down easily, and hey, you can always make shortcuts the\
      \ player can hammer jump (Rocket Jump in 2003/2004) to if they want. Also, aiming\
      \ up and down to fire fight is always fun.</p>\n<p>An example would be <i>DM-Phobos</i>.\
      \ You can hammer jump to the armor from the hallway below, or you can also hammer\
      \ jump up to the ledge from the area with pads/flak if the boots are gone. It's\
      \ all part of flow and adds an element of surprise to the game. You just don't\
      \ know where your opponent will pop up from. Also consider lift jumps.</p>\n\
      <p><i>DM-Deck16][</i> is a good example of a useful lift jump for catching a\
      \ player off guard. Deck16][ is also a great example of z-axis use. The multiple\
      \ levels can make a level feel very large and complex when they are fairly small\
      \ and simple.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"/Legacy:Z-Axis\" title=\"Legacy:Z-Axis\"\

      <p>Every DM map should have at least as many <a href=\"/Legacy:PlayerStart\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:PlayerStart\">PlayerStarts</a> as the top of the recommended\
      \ player load (and more is always good).</p>\n<p>Generally, about 1.5x the amount\
      \ of playerstarts should be present depending on the max players for the map.\
      \ If you plan on allowing 5 max players, then place down at least 7-8 players\
      \ start. It's good to follow these rules for two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When\
      \ multiple players are fragged, it makes sure that there are enough playerstarts\
      \ for the returning players. If there are not enough, it will result in frustrating\
      \ telefragging in UT, or being temporarily unable to respawn in UT2004.</li>\n\
      <li>It allows some variety in spawning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See also <a href=\"\

      <p>Don't place too many desirable items or weapons next to each other. This\
      \ will become a camper's haven. For example, the shock/belt room in <i>DM-Peak</i>.\
      \ You can dominate the game by just standing in the corner and making combos.\
      \ A good way to make a hot spot is to designate an area with useful items and\
      \ weapons close to each other so that a player who wants to control that area\
      \ still has to move around. A good idea is to make the respawn time for shieldbelts\
      \ and armor about 50 seconds to a minute. Another use that items/weapons serve\
      \ is sound cues to alert players of another's position. Example on <i>DM-Turbine</i>\
      \ – the elevator that leads to the rocket launcher is preceded by several health\
      \ vials. A good player would hear the sound of the vials being taken and an\
      \ elevator being used thus predicting where his opponent might be.</p>\n<p>See\

      <p>The Level Designer can think of the DeathMatch Map as a scene from a Hollywood\
      \ Blockbuster. Numerous architectural design features can be added to the basic\
      \ level geometry to enhance the visual impact of gameplay and make it more exciting.\
      \ This can be a challenge for designers; to come up with inspirational themes\
      \ and ambiance, while maintaining fast and furious flow dynamics, lethally insane\
      \ fun, and ultra-realistic real-time 3D rendering. Architecture can be be used\
      \ for eye candy, but it is best when used to create a more realistic-looking\
      \ map. Paying attention to details such as load bearing supports (pillars),\
      \ trims, windows, fog, climbing vines, etc can keep a deathmatcher more immersed\
      \ in his environment. You may also want to create exploding glass and or walls\
      \ to make some intresting secrets in your levels like a plain wall and a place\
      \ where it can be blown up going to an area with the redemer in it. Or glass\
      \ tiles in the floor that look into the floor below that can be shot out.</p>\n\

      \ I like the way that this article looks. However, I think that it could also\
      \ use a few blurbs on how to make a map more condusive to gameplay for TeamDM\
      \ and Last Man Standing. I'd write these details myself, but I'm not too knowledgable\
      \ on this topic.</p>\n<p><b>&lt;MOZI&gt;:</b> Hey this is nice i can add stuff\
      \ to a tutorial. Okay reason im adding this comment is to help n00bies ( if\
      \ u dont speak that jargon i wrote newbies), becuase i was once a (hate to say\
      \ it but..) BAD mapper, no talent what so ever. However i never gave up( everyone\
      \ says that) But the key to my evergroing unreal skills was practice. Anywas\
      \ about DM gameplay there are two ways to hit this one is just build rooms and\
      \ hallways which is good place to start but dont stick with it. When u make\
      \ ur room add two or three doors or cuts in the wall to access other places\
      \ and take u different directions. Once u keep doing that and adding great theme\
      \ and eyecandy and realism the map begins to create the flow on its own ull\
      \ see waht i mean when it happenz. For even more flow and fast game play add\
      \ curve hallways ( ZETO IS GREAT IN THIS ) the Z axis ( DECK, CODEX, TURBINE,\
      \ PHOBOS, FLOATING PYRAMID) those are great maps to study with in the editor.\
      \ Also im going to quote DavidM on this \" DOnt be afraid to rip of style\"\
      . In my own words means examine a style try to copy it ( NOT COPY PASTE&#160;!)\
      \ to make ur own style and flow well ive rambled enough enjoy UNREAL&#160;!</p>\n\
      <p><b>Bean:</b> Added some of my insight.</p>\n<p><b>Luggage:</b> I think \"\

    text: "Mapping for DeathMatch couldn't be easier. They can be a lot of fun to\
      \ make.  They allow you a lot of freedom because essentially there are no \"\
      rules.\" There is really nothing special that has to be put in a DeathMatch\
      \ map. Your first endeavor as a mapper is almost always a DM map, and when you\
      \ make a new map in UnrealEd it defaults to being DM (when you click the joystick\
      \ button to [[Legacy:Playtest|Playtest]] the map). \n\nHowever, there are some\
      \ ingredients that you need to have a succesful DM map.\n\n==Map Flow==\n\n\
      [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]] above all else.  You have to be able to get from\
      \ one place to another very easily.  And what's more you've got to have several\
      \ options.  UnrealTournament's ''DM-Tempest'' has brilliant flow as does ''DM-Malevolence.''\
      \  They are almost open ended but not at all confusing to navigate.  The reason\
      \ is that no two places look the same so you can tell where you are.  This is\
      \ why a symmetrical map is bad in DM in my opinion. Another thing with flow\
      \ you might want to consider is the fact that you might want doors and other\
      \ movers in the way with switches to open them for all the nice detail but it\
      \ really can ruin the flow if you want to get to the next room in a small amount\
      \ of time and get fragged because you were finding the switch. But all the flow\
      \ really depends on the type of deathmatch map you want to create; you can make\
      \ the map that is more realistic and actually takes an environment and makes\
      \ it a killing field, or you can make the arena style like DM-Fractal where\
      \ you must focus your flow on keeping the possiblity of fragging from every\
      \ angle all while maintaining a fast paced match. \n\nFlow should dictate architecture.\
      \ Build you details around the path you have created.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Map\
      \ Flow|Map Flow]].\n\n===Z-Axis===\n\nThis is the second element.  The [[Legacy:Z-Axis|Z-axis]]\
      \ is essentially part of your flow.  You need to be able to go up/down easily,\
      \ and hey, you can always make shortcuts the player can hammer jump (Rocket\
      \ Jump in 2003/2004) to if they want. Also, aiming up and down to fire fight\
      \ is always fun.\n\nAn example would be ''DM-Phobos''.  You can hammer jump\
      \ to the armor from the hallway below, or you can also hammer jump up to the\
      \ ledge from the area with pads/flak if the boots are gone.  It's all part of\
      \ flow and adds an element of surprise to the game.  You just don't know where\
      \ your opponent will pop up from.  Also consider lift jumps.  \n\n''DM-Deck16][''\
      \ is a good example of a useful lift jump for catching a player off guard. Deck16][\
      \ is also a great example of z-axis use. The multiple levels can make a level\
      \ feel very large and complex when they are fairly small and simple.\n\nSee\
      \ also [[Legacy:Z-Axis|Z-Axis]].\n\n===Player Starts===\n\nEvery DM map should\
      \ have at least as many [[Legacy:PlayerStart|PlayerStart]]s as the top of the\
      \ recommended player load (and more is always good).\n\nGenerally, about 1.5x\
      \ the amount of playerstarts should be present depending on the max players\
      \ for the map. If you plan on allowing 5 max players, then place down at least\
      \ 7-8 players start. It's good to follow these rules for two reasons:\n*When\
      \ multiple players are fragged, it makes sure that there are enough playerstarts\
      \ for the returning players. If there are not enough, it will result in frustrating\
      \ telefragging in UT, or being temporarily unable to respawn in UT2004.\n*It\
      \ allows some variety in spawning.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Placing PlayerStart|Placing\
      \ PlayerStart]].\n\n===Item Placement===\n\nDon't place too many desirable items\
      \ or weapons next to each other.  This will become a camper's haven.  For example,\
      \ the shock/belt room in ''DM-Peak''. You can dominate the game by just standing\
      \ in the corner and making combos. A good way to make a hot spot is to designate\
      \ an area with useful items and weapons close to each other so that a player\
      \ who wants to control that area still has to move around. A good idea is to\
      \ make the respawn time for shieldbelts and armor about 50 seconds to a minute.\
      \ Another use that items/weapons serve is sound cues to alert players of another's\
      \ position.  Example on ''DM-Turbine'' &ndash; the elevator that leads to the\
      \ rocket launcher is preceded by several health vials.  A good player would\
      \ hear the sound of the vials being taken and an elevator being used thus predicting\
      \ where his opponent might be.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Inventory Item Placement|Inventory\
      \ Item Placement]].\n\n==Architectural Details and Ambience==\n\nThe Level Designer\
      \ can think of the DeathMatch Map as a scene from a Hollywood Blockbuster. Numerous\
      \ architectural design features can be added to the basic level geometry to\
      \ enhance the visual impact of gameplay and make it more exciting. This can\
      \ be a challenge for designers; to come up with inspirational themes and ambiance,\
      \ while maintaining fast and furious flow dynamics, lethally insane fun, and\
      \ ultra-realistic real-time 3D rendering. Architecture can be be used for eye\
      \ candy, but it is best when used to create a more realistic-looking map. Paying\
      \ attention to details such as load bearing supports (pillars), trims, windows,\
      \ fog, climbing vines, etc can keep a deathmatcher more immersed in his environment.\
      \ You may also want to create exploding glass and or walls to make some intresting\
      \ secrets in your levels like a plain wall and a place where it can be blown\
      \ up going to an area with the redemer in it. Or glass tiles in the floor that\
      \ look into the floor below that can be shot out.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Map Design|Map\
      \ Design]].\n\n==\"Gifts and Gimmicks\"==\n\n''If you aren't a Boy Scout, you\
      \ wouldn't get that reference.  The magazine, ''Boys Life'' has a section's\
      \ title called '''Gifts and Gimmicks'''.''\n\nThese are always an element that\
      \ can be thrown in to add to a DM map. Like traps for instance, they are fun\
      \ to make and can provide some fun visuals to watch but dont go to overborn\
      \ with it and create a map that depends on the player to get a score of 0 to\
      \ win over the others with negatives. The trap in ''DM-Pressure'' is always\
      \ fun.  However a map should never be just about a gimmick.  A gimmick should\
      \ add to the map but not be the main part of it.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Gameplay|Gameplay]].\n\
      \n==Other Gametypes==\n\nThere are several other [[Legacy:Gametype|Gametype]]s\
      \ that use Deathmatch maps.\n\n===Standard Gametypes===\n* [[Legacy:TeamDeathmatch|TeamDeathmatch]]\n\
      * [[Legacy:LastManStanding|LastManStanding]] (UT2004 only)\n* [[Legacy:Invasion|Invasion]]\
      \ (UT2004 only)\n* [[Legacy:Mutant|Mutant]] (UT2004 only)\n\n===Custom Gametypes===\n\

      ** [[Legacy:Mapping For 1on1|Mapping for 1on1]]\n* [[Legacy:Team Number|Team\
      \ Number]] &ndash; For Team Deathmatch, this page refers to a useful custom\
      \ actor, TeamSpawn.\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''TechnoJF:'''  I like the way that\
      \ this article looks.  However, I think that it could also use a few blurbs\
      \ on how to make a map more condusive to gameplay for TeamDM and Last Man Standing.\
      \  I'd write these details myself, but I'm not too knowledgable on this topic.\n\
      \n'''<MOZI>:''' Hey this is nice i can add stuff to a tutorial. Okay reason\
      \ im adding this comment is to help n00bies ( if u dont speak that jargon i\
      \ wrote newbies), becuase i was once a (hate to say it but..) BAD mapper, no\
      \ talent what so ever. However i never gave up( everyone says that) But the\
      \ key to my evergroing unreal skills was practice. Anywas about DM gameplay\
      \ there are two ways to hit this one is just build rooms and hallways which\
      \ is good place to start but dont stick with it. When u make ur room add two\
      \ or three doors or cuts in the wall to access other places and take u different\
      \ directions. Once u keep doing that and adding great theme and eyecandy and\
      \ realism the map begins to create the flow on its own ull see waht i mean when\
      \ it happenz. For even more flow and fast game play add curve hallways ( ZETO\
      \ IS GREAT IN THIS ) the Z axis ( DECK, CODEX, TURBINE, PHOBOS, FLOATING PYRAMID)\
      \ those are great maps to study with in the editor. Also im going to quote DavidM\
      \ on this \" DOnt be afraid to rip of style\". In my own words means examine\
      \ a style try to copy it ( NOT COPY PASTE !) to make ur own style and flow well\
      \ ive rambled enough enjoy UNREAL ! \n\n'''Bean:''' Added some of my insight.\n\
      \n'''Luggage:''' I think \"flow\" should rather be replaced by \"gameplay\"\
      , and have flow as a sub-point... [[Legacy:Gameplay|Gameplay]] isn't all about\
      \ flow, you know... I learned that already, I think ;)\n\nIt's rather floorplan,\
      \ scaling and items... flow is a result of those. Right, Mr. M.?\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]] handles flow, [[Legacy:Gameplay|Gameplay]] talks\
      \ about gameplay.  As sub-topics to Map Flow, [[Legacy:Placing PlayerStart|Placing\
      \ PlayerStart]] and [[Legacy:Inventory Item Placement|Inventory Item Placement]]\
      \ are available.  [[Legacy:Map Design|Map Design]] talks about general concepts\
      \ and elements, serving as a sub-hub.  This page obviously has been around a\
      \ while, I just updated the current linkage and re-arranged the sections to\
      \ match the current [[Legacy:Topics On Mapping|Topics On Mapping]] organization.\
