      <p>The arena is a perfect place to implement that risk balance stuff I was talking\
      \ about earlier. In fact, take a look at any of my levels and you will find\
      \ that the arena will have some kind of life-threatening decision to make.</p>\n\
      <p>Actually, a good example is Snowdog's JB-Talaeron (UTJB) – you have the choice\
      \ of staying low with your shock-rifle or going onto the rise and getting the\
      \ damage amp (I usually stay low as the person getting the damage amp is in\
      \ the perfect spot for a good combo...).</p>\n<div class=\"center\">\n<div class=\"\
