      \ or CTF? This is also one of the more debated topics about Jailbreak… and to\
      \ tell you the truth, I really couldn't make a choice between the two, honestly.\
      \ So instead, I’ll say how Jailbreak is similar to each of them – this can influence\
      \ the way you will design the layout of your map because obviously there is\
      \ a huge difference between designing a DM level and designing a CTF level –\
      \ and the way I explain it should show that it is a nice compromise between\
      \ the two&#160;:-)</p>\n<p>So… TDM. Obviously in Jailbreak you have to try and\
      \ frag the other players as much as possible, like in TDM right? True, but fragging\
      \ players can also sometimes be second priority to releasing your team, just\
      \ as in CTF fragging is often second priority to capturing the flag. Jailbreak\
      \ also needs team-colours to indicate which base you are in, and just like in\
      \ CTF, the map should be designed to allow for <b>defense points</b>. On the\
      \ other hand, unlike CTF, the release room should be hard to get <b>into</b>,\
      \ but not necessarily hard to get <b>out of</b> (where in CTF the flagroom should\
      \ not be too easy to get out of). Because you end up in Jail when you get fragged\
      \ too, it means that it makes you value your life more than both TDM and CTF.\
      \ Jailbreak is the perfect compromise in gameplay – it makes your life very\
      \ valuable, so your first instinct is to hide... \"Oh, but I have to rescue\
      \ my team!\"... so you can't hide, and you get points for releasing, so now\
      \ it makes sense to attack instead of hiding… \"But then I might die and cause\
      \ the capture of my team!\"... so maybe you should hide... \"But they're relying\
      \ on me to release them!\"... so you have to attack!... Aaahhhhhhhhhh!!! Hehe.\
      \ You choose&#160;:-)</p>\n<p>So for the purpose of level design, lets say that\
      \ in this sense it is good to design a level with at least some Z-axis, and\
      \ with good connectivity for those one-on-one situations which are so common\
      \ in Jailbreak (i.e. <b>get</b> anywhere in the map <b>from</b> anywhere in\
      \ the map). CTF can sometimes be fun without a whole heap of Z-axis (Hydro16),\
      \ whereas because of the Deathmatch element in Jailbreak, you really need to\
      \ include some higher spots, so a player’s ability to move around the map doesn't\
      \ go unrewarded. But obviously in Jailbreak there are two teams, and there are\
      \ release switches. So your level won’t end up just like a Deathmatch level\
      \ because you need to have clearly defined bases for the release switch, and\
      \ just like in CTF, both symmetrical and asymmetrical layouts can be good. A\
      \ good example of the mixture between CTF and DM layouts is my map JB-Phobos][\
      \ (UTJB) – it had the same theme as Inoxx’s original DM, and about the same\
      \ amount of Z-axis (about four or five levels), but still had clearly defined\
      \ bases and was symmetrical. Lots of routes in the centre, but only one way\
      \ to the release switch… and it plays good. JB-Phobos][ is taking it to the\
      \ extreme though in terms of z-axis&#160;:-)</p>\n<p>So, in short – try to design\
      \ your levels to cater for both styles of gameplay – think of what you like\
      \ about a good Deathmatch level, or a good CTF level, and try to combine them\
      \ to produce a design that works well, good luck, that’s always the fun part\
      \ for me!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"/Legacy:Mapping_For_Jailbreak/Shooting_From_Jails\"\
