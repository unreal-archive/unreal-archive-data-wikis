      <p>One of the most fun parts of designing a level for me is also giving the\
      \ player choices throughout the entire level. This aspect is very important,\
      \ and is relevant to all gametypes. I like to call it \"Risk Balance\". Either\
      \ on a broad scale (\"Should I take the left route, that has the UDamage, to\
      \ the enemy base – or should I take the right route, where I am less likely\
      \ to encounter that l33t Spoondog on the way...\"), or on a smaller scale (\"\
      Oh crap, I could jump down and grab the RL, but I think Spoondog might own me,\
      \ so maybe I'll stay up here with my mediocre weapon...\"). As a level designer,\
      \ you have the opportunity to create as much of that as you like, and what better\
      \ game to do it in than Unreal Tournament – with so many weapons, fire modes,\
      \ pickups and varying opportunities at your disposal...</p>\n<p>Here are some\
      \ common examples in my Jailbreak maps:</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n\

      \ get my head sniped off, and there's no weapons up there... On the other hand,\
      \ I could just take one of the side routes – that way I won't get the super\
      \ shield but at least I'll get a minigun or shock-rifle for my troubles...\"\
      </p>\n<p><b>JB-CastleBreak (JB2003/2004)</b> – Example of balancing switches\

      \ drawbridge and I think someone might close it before I get there... so I'll\
      \ go around the back and use the other release switch – it takes longer but\
