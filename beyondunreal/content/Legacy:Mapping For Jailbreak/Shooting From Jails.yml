      <p>I’ve heard this before, and trust me – it's not a bug. In fact, the jails\
      \ in my maps are notorious for being able to shoot out of them.</p>\n<p>A perfect\
      \ example of this is \"JB-Complex: (UTJB) – I specifically designed and placed\
      \ the jails so they were at a high vantage point, and had bar windows on all\
      \ sides so players could shoot unsuspecting players from their containment!\
      \ It adds an extra twist to those otherwise boring jails, and makes sure jail-door-camping\
      \ Llamas get what they deserve&#160;:-)</p>\n<p>It also means that players aren't\
      \ completely useless while in jail, which I personally like.</p>\n<p>One thing\
      \ to remember is that this means players can also shoot <b>in</b> at jailed\
      \ players. However, players don’t get any points for killing jailed players\
      \ and are only risking their own life and wasting their ammo in doing so. So\
      \ by all means, don't be afraid to let players shoot through your jail doors\
      \ and windows if you feel the need!&#160;:)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Previous:</b>\
