      <p>The heading pretty much explains itself. Boring jails were a bit of a problem\
      \ in the old Jailbreak days before <a href=\"/Legacy:Mychaeel\" title=\"Legacy:Mychaeel\"\
      >Mychaeel</a>'s <a href=\"/Legacy:Screen\" title=\"Legacy:Screen\">Screen</a>\
      \ and <a href=\"/Legacy:CameraSpot\" title=\"Legacy:CameraSpot\">CameraSpot</a>\
      \ components became available. Nowadays you have a ton of things at your disposal\
      \ to throw in your jails and relieve the prisoners of their boredom while they\
      \ wait to be released.</p>\n<p>You can use:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt><a href=\"/Legacy:CameraSpot\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:CameraSpot\">CameraSpot</a> (UTJB), <a href=\"http://mychaeel.no-ip.com/jailbreak/JBCamera\"\
      \ class=\"extiw\" title=\"jdn:JBCamera\">JBCamera</a> (JB2003/2004)&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Put some JBCamera actors throughout your level in cool spots, and stick\
      \ a monitor/trigger in Jail so prisoners can surveil the action outside while\
      \ they get taken from behi... *ahem*... anyway... yea, there's also lots of\
      \ functionality <b>within</b> these JBCameras – you can make them switchable\
      \ by the person who is watching through them, you can make them change using\
      \ a timer, or JB2003/2004 even has an automated function that you can set, where\
      \ the game will choose the best camera for the player to view, based on the\
      \ amount of players in view.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt><a href=\"/Legacy:Screen\"\

      \ put a scoreboard on the wall, or a map surveillance screen that shows the\
      \ location of all the players in the game (just like the scoreboard minimap),\
      \ or even an IRC chat screen where you can chat in an IRC channel from within\

      \ people who are playing a level with an IRC screen in it&#160;:-)</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>Prison Escapes&#160;</dt>\n<dd>One of those things where I can't begin\
      \ to explain the fun you could have making one of these! So many possibilities\
      \ – you could make a hatch where prisoners have to make a human ladder to escape,\
      \ or there can be more elaborate escapes such as the excellent example in Tarquin's\
      \ JB-Pressurized (UTJB). Or you could have a combination of human ladders and\
      \ fighting monsters (JB-EternalCaves-III – UTJB), or an impact jump, then a\
      \ death-defying (actually, often not \"defying\" death at all muhahaha) set\
      \ of leaps on poles over a pool of acid, all the time have a stone titan throwing\
      \ instant-kill rocks at you!!! (JB-SprinTitan – UTJB). Usually escapes will\
      \ leave the prisoner low on health too so as not to give them <b>too</b> much\
      \ of a reward (Hell, they already got out of Jail free!)</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dt>Arena Switches&#160;</dt>\n<dd>You can put switches in Jails that prisoners\
      \ on each team can press if they wish to challenge each other for freedom in\

      \ in your maps! (I only left CastleBreak's Jails empty because I ran out of\
      \ time... but that's not an excuse... *ahem*) One thing you will find about\
