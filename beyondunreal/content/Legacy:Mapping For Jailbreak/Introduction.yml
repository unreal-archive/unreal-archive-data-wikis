      \ My name is Cory Spooner a.k.a. Spoondog and I am from New Zealand, but am\
      \ currently working in Australia for <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\"\
      \ href=\"http://www.perception.com.au\">Perception Pty.</a> on a future Unreal\
      \ title based on the popular Stargate SG-1 television series.</p>\n<p>If you\
      \ have played a fair bit of Jailbreak then you will probably have played a few\
      \ of my maps. I have been designing levels for Unreal Tournament since somewhere\
      \ in 2000, and have made approximately fourty to fifty levels in total for UT,\
      \ UT2003 and UT2004 -– around thirty of them are for Jailbreak.&#160;:-)</p>\n\
      <p>Jailbreak is the most fun gametype I have come across and that is why I continue\
      \ to map for it. The community is great, and if you design a level for Jailbreak,\
      \ you can be sure it will be well-received by almost everybody –- which always\
      \ makes it worth the effort! Jailbreak is also widely played and reviewed, and\
      \ is accepted by major map sites such as <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
      \ text\" href=\"http://www.nalicity.com\">Nali City</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mapraider.com\">Mapraider</a>, so\
      \ any levels you make will most likely get a lot of exposure, and you will find\
      \ that Jailbreak levels get commented on almost as much as standard gametypes.\
      \ Why Epic hasn’t included Jailbreak as a standard gametype yet is beyond me!&#160;;-)</p>\n\
      <p>This guide covers Jailbreak 2004, Jailbreak 2003 and UT Jailbreak and uses\
      \ examples from all of them. It should only be used as a reference, and please\
      \ be aware that a fair chunk of this guide is formed from my own experience\
      \ in Jailbreak mapping and may not necessarily reflect the opinions of other\
      \ level designers or players. Also keep in mind that even I am guilty of not\
      \ following these, my own, guidelines – but just because a map doesn't follow\
      \ a particular guideline doesn’t mean it is a bad map! I have tried to cover\
      \ most aspects of Jailbreak mapping, and you will find that a lot of these guidelines\
      \ also relate to mapping for other game-types besides Jailbreak, though if I\
      \ tried to cover all of those I would be here forever. The sections in this\
      \ document are not in any particular order, so be sure to read it all!</p>\n\
      <p>So anyway, seeing you have chosen to design a map for Jailbreak –- read on\
      \ and I’m sure these guidelines will help you on your way to creating the ultimate\
