      \ For Territories]]) and old fashioned Deathmatch. I have figured out some ways\
      \ of getting other exciting gametypes to work without ANY scripting or coding.\
      \ Read on....\n\nYou need to have a good understanding of basic map skills.\n\
      \n==Siege==\n\nThis gametype is in [[Legacy:Pariah|Pariah]] and im sure in others.\
      \ This is how we can make a siege gametype where one team defends while the\
      \ other team attacks an objective.\n\n'''Note:''' Ive spent a very long time\
      \ getting this to work properly online where things dont work the same as when\
      \ tested through the editor. You are welcome to suggest any improvements but\
      \ please dont try to be smart when following this and miss out a step because\
      \ it might make it easier for you. Thanks\n\n==Part 1:Basic configuration==\n\
      \nGo to the level properties and set the gametype to DTerrGameInfo. Didn't see\
      \ it in the menu? thats because you need to open the '''DTerritories''' package\
      \ in the actor class browser. Always open that whenever you start work on this.\n\
      \n==Part 2:Team 1 spawner==\n\nThe resistance will be attacking an objective\
      \ (in this case a valuable power generator) which will be guarded by the conformists.\
      \ We need to set up a protected spawning area for the resistance. Heres how\
      \ you do it.\n\n# In the Dspawnsm static mesh package, there is all the static\
      \ meshes you need to construct a standard spawning platform. Arrange them into\
      \ a 3x2 rectangle and add the side trim bars to make it look nice.\n# \nThe\
      \ SMs are just for show. You need to add a playerstart above each spawner plate.\
      \ When you have, set each playerstarts properties to the following:\n\n* PlayerstartTeam>1\n\
      * Spawnpoint=True\n\n# Now we must add the spawner. Go into the prefab browser\
      \ (you cant get to it from under the view menu so go to the actor class browser)\
      \ and look for '''DSpawner'''. Add it into your map with the middle mouse button-or\
      \ right click in wireframe mode and \"add decoration here\". Set the spawners\
      \ properties to the following:\n\nDDecoDamage Structuralintegrity=0. The conformists\
      \ cant get to the spawner, but its good to make it invincible anyway.\n\nSpawnerTeamID=1\
      \  \n\nPlayerstarts= Expand this field, and click on Add, then Find. The cursor\
      \ should turn to a arrow with a question mark next to it. Click on one of your\
      \ playerstarts and it should appear in the space. Repeat for all 6 playerstarts.\
      \ If that doesnt work, type the name (found under the object field) of each\
      \ playerstart manually into the space.\n\nYou can delete the spawner objective\
      \ (the green hexagon thing) and the interact points.\n\nyou should now have\
      \ 6 playerstarts hooked to a spawner. No we have to make sure the spawning area\
      \ is protected. We need to put a laser fence across each entrance to make sure\
      \ conformists cant get in.\n\n1: Make the [[Legacy:Red Builder Brush|red builder\
      \ brush]] the right size for the laser fence. This will form the part that will\
      \ actually block players. Then add a volume '''DLaserfencevolume'''. You should\
      \ see a pinkish volume appear when you move the builder brush away.\n\n2: You\
      \ can delete the two interact points, they are not needed.\n\n3: Under the laser\
      \ fence notification (the eagle head icon) set the Team to 1. When [[Legacy:Realtime\
      \ Preview|realtime preview]] is activated, the lasers should be blue. You can\
      \ rotate the laser fence emitter to the correct orientation. The static meshes\
      \ for the laser emitters are found in DDecosmb, but you wil have to press the\
      \ \"all\" tab to see them.\n\nRepeat for every entrance to the resistance base.\n\

      \ Ive done something like it before although there is problems with the spawner\

      \nEnd objective=False\n\nFeedback>\n\nTitle \"defend the power generator\" or\
      \ something along those lines. Again tweak the visible values if it doesnt show\
      \ up when playing as a conformist.\n\nWell done! its finished. Check you have\

      \ with an hidden spawner box.\n*A protected spawning area for the conformists\
      \ with the spawner forming the destroyable part of the generator.\n*The spawner\

      \ objective and that it refers to the correct spawner-it should be default.\n\
      \n===Things to explore===\n\nI havent tried this yet, but i think it would be\
      \ possible to have each team with a generator so both can attack each others.\
