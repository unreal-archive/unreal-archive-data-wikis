    text: "'''Anti portals''' are special [[occlusion]] shapes in [[Unreal Engine\
      \ 2]] that help optimizing the performance of a level.\n\n==Anti portal occlusion==\n\
      Anti portals can occlude entire actors and individual [[BSP surfaces]]. In either\
      \ case, the object to occlude must be covered completely by any ''single'' anti\
      \ portal. If even a tiny bit of the object sticks out behind the anti portal,\
      \ then it will not be occluded. This also applies if only a part part of the\
      \ object is covered by one anti portal and the rest is covered by another anti\
      \ portal: neither of the two anti portals covers the entire object, so it will\
      \ not be occluded.\n\nConsider the following 2D example:\n[[Image:AntiPortal-Occlusion.png|center]]\n\
      Here you can see two anti portals, represented by the red and green lines. The\
      \ red and green areas behind them mark their individual occlusion areas. As\
      \ you can see, the triangle and rectangle are completely hidden behind the green\
      \ and red anti portal respectively. The circle is not hidden by any individual\
      \ anti portal, only by the combination of them.\n\nFor the renderer the triangle\
      \ and the rectangle are occluded, i.e. not considered for rendering. The circle,\
      \ however, is not covered by any individual anti portal and thus does not get\
      \ occluded. Keep this behavior in mind when deciding where to place anti portals.\n\
      \n==General rules for using anti portals==\n;Don't use them right away:Apply\
      \ other optimization techniques first. Make sure you properly divide your map\
      \ into [[zones]] and use \"cheaper\" level optimization techniques like [[bLonelyZone]],\
      \ [[ManualExcludes]], [[CullDistance]] and [[ForcedVisibilityZoneTag]] first\
      \ before using anti portals.\n;Use as few as possible:The engine needs to check\
      \ every visible actor against all anti portals in the level. At a certain point\
      \ adding more anti portals starts to hurt more than it helps.\n;Make them as\
      \ big as possible:Remember, only if the entire actor or surface is covered by\
      \ an anti portal, it will really be excluded from rendering. Thus anti portals\
      \ should be as big as possible to fill out as much of the object that blocks\
      \ the view.\n;Keep the shape simple:Again, there's a performance trade-of here.\
      \ If a slightly more complex anti portal helps occluding more actors, then it\
      \ may be fine. However, when it gets too complex, it takes too much time to\
      \ check the occlusion.\n\n==Types of anti portals==\n===Anti portal surfaces===\n\
      Every surface of a brush can be flagged as an anti portal using the [[UE2:surface\
      \ properties window|surface properties window]]. When doing this, the entire\
      \ surface in its original shape acts as an anti portal sheet. The surface should\
      \ be a [[wp:convex polygon|convex polygon]] and will always be used in its unaltered\
      \ form. Any holes created by other subtracted brushes will be ignored for the\
      \ anti portal shape and may cause [[HOM]] effects!\n\nAnti portal surfaces only\
      \ have an effect in the zone they belong to.\n[[Image:AntiPortal-NoOcclusion.png|center]]\n\
      In the above example the walls separate two zones. Zone A contains the viewer\
      \ and some object. In zone B there is a wall that is flagged as anti portal\
      \ and it appears to perfectly cover the object in zone A. However, zone B is\
      \ no visible from zone A, so the anti portal surface in zone B is never considered\
      \ when testing the object in zone A for occlusion.\n\nIf multiple surfaces are\
      \ flagged as anti portals, they will act as individual anti portals for occlusion.\
      \ If you need a 3D shape, use an AntiPortalActor instead. However, anti portal\
      \ surfaces have the advantage of \"hiding\" actors in network games, while AntiPortalActors\
      \ don't. So in order to optimize network performance of a level, you should\
      \ prefer using anti portal surfaces, unless there's already BSP around the area\
      \ you want to place the anti portal.\n\n===AntiPortalActors===\n[[Image:UnrealEd-Toolbox-AddAntiPortal.png|left]]\n\
      For anti portals that aren't just sheets, an {{classgames|AntiPortalActor|e=UE2}}\
      \ must be used. It is created in a similar way as [[volumes]] or [[brushes]],\
      \ but must be convex (no holes and not \"dented\" in any way) and is added through\
      \ the '''Add Antiportal''' button.\n\nAn AntiPortalActor is displayed as a brown\
      \ (or bright orange if selected) volume in the editor. In real-time preview\
      \ mode and in the game the AntiPortalActor itself is invisible and can only\
      \ be noticed as it occludes actors and BSP surfaces it covers. While you should\
      \ try to fill out an static mesh or terrain shape as closely as possible, make\
      \ sure the anti portal does not stick out of the static mesh, as it may cause\
      \ [[HOM]] effects.\n\nAn additional advantage of AntiPortalActors over anti\
      \ portal surfaces is that you can turn them off dynamically during the game.\
      \ This feature is mostly used in combination with door [[movers]], where the\
      \ mover directly controls the AntiPortalActor. To set this up, simply [[match\
      \ the Tag]] of the AntiPortalActor with the ''AntiPortalTag'' of the Mover.\
      \ If no mover is involved, AntiPortalActors can also be controlled through triggering\
      \ if their [[InitialState]] is set to either ''TriggerToggle'' or ''TriggerControl''.\n\
