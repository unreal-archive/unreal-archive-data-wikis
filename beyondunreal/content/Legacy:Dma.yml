      \ another browser, for example [http://www.opera.com Opera]?\n\n'''Guest:'''\
      \ Yep, occurs on this box using IE6, in either WinXP or 2k.\n\n'''Dma:'''  Perhaps\
      \ we could describe how a Game and Level are built/loaded.  For instance, [[Legacy:LevelInfo|LevelInfo]]\
      \ is spawned (or created in some other way) without a [[Legacy:LevelInfo|LevelInfo]]\
      \ to work with in PreBeginPlay.  Also, we might want to discuss saved games\
      \ in more depth.\n\n:'''Tarquin:'''  build the page and they will come.... :D\n\
      \n'''Dma:'''  We need to place a link to http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki?action=links\
      \ in a very prominent place.  This gives you loads of neat stuff.\n\n:'''Tarquin:'''\
      \  Done: [[Legacy:Wiki System Commands|Wiki System Commands]]\n\n'''Dma:'''\
      \  Is there any way that we can extend Wiki to allow more sub-levels?  It might\
      \ be nice to place ALL pages corresponding to UnrealScript classes in their\
      \ own directory or something.\n\n:'''Mychaeel:'''  The Wiki is not meant to\
      \ be hierarchically structured.  We might introduce namespaces, but they'd rather\
      \ be used to distinguish between information related to different Unreal-engine\
      \ games.\n\n:'''Tarquin:'''  We could introduce a category system. I've mentioned\
      \ it on [[Legacy:Project Discussion|Project Discussion]], but briefly all class\
      \ pages would be [[:Category:Legacy Class]] and a category search would give\
      \ the whole list.\n\n'''Dma:'''  I can do this:\n\n<uscript>\nclass SomeStupidActor\
      \ extends Actor;\n\nvar bool bSomeVar;\nimport package UnrealShare;\n...\n</uscript>\n\
      \nand it works... What does <b>import</b> do?  It is supposed to take an <b>enum</b>,\
      \ <b>struct</b>, or <b>package</b> and I am not sure how it works.  There is\
      \ also a <b>from</b> keyword.  Not sure how to use it.\n\n:'''Mychaeel:''' \
      \ See http://mb.link-m.de/mirror/UndocumentedUC.htm &ndash; never got it to\
      \ work myself.\n\n'''Dma:''' Also, is there a way to run a function when a user\
      \ disconnects from your map?  Or is everything Destroy()ed?\n\n----\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Yes, <code><b style=...></b></code> does work.  We were aware of that but\
      \ didn't bother to remove it because we didn't expect it to be exploited, but\
      \ removing that attribute from unescaped HTML tags wouldn't be a problem at\
      \ all.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Personal Page|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
