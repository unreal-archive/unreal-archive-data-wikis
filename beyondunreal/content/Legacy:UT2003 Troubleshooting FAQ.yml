      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Well, the real magic behind the nVidia map/menu stuff is the\
      \ gametype, CinematicGame. When the gametype is triggered, it opens up the menu\
      \ stuff. Also, CinematicGame triggers the event \"StartGame\" when a player\
      \ \"logs in.\" This is generally the event for the cinematic you are going to\
      \ display, and then you trigger the gametype when the cinematic finishes. You\
      \ might be able to bypass the animation simply by setting the Gametypes trigger\
      \ to \"StartGame\" so it would trigger itself as soon as it was done initializing.</p>\n\
