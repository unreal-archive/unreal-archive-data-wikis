      <p><b>Flashman:</b> For the record the 'Floating solid' method uses the same\
      \ preparation steps as above, but in place of the <a href=\"/Legacy:Semisolid\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Semisolid\">semisolid</a> sized 128x128x16, make a cube brush\

      \ Special\">Add special brush</a> -&gt; (Solid, Invisible) in the same position\
      \ as before. The reson for bringing the sides in alittle bit is that if the\
      \ solid makes contact with the windowframe then you'll get <a href=\"/Legacy:Terminology\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Terminology\">HOM</a> on the area of contact, as the engine\
      \ thinks there's no surface there to render.</p>\n<p><i><b>Arguments for / against\
      \ this method:</b></i></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A bot can 'see' through a semisolid, but\
      \ not a solid, for instance if your window points out to some lovely scenery,\
      \ then you might want to stop the bots having to calculate any possible threat\
      \ in this direction, as there's never going to be one, and likewise if it's\
      \ a window into another part of your level it would be wise to let your bots\
      \ 'see' through it in interests of fair play!&#160;:D</li>\n<li>Semisolids don't\
      \ make BSP cuts, but in most cirumstances solids do. This is why semisolids\
      \ are most commonly used for pillars. If you use solids for pillars/in your\
      \ windows and find that you <i>Node Ratio</i> is high (generally more than 2)\
      \ then switch to semisolids</li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>N.B. The Node Ratio is the ratio\
      \ of BSP leaf Nodes to the number of Polys in your map, and can be checked in\
      \ the <a href=\"/Legacy:Build_Window\" title=\"Legacy:Build Window\">Build Window</a>.\

      <p><i>Example:</i> Two 256x256x256 rooms(side by side) divided by a 128x128x64\
      \ cube \"window enclosure\". What I do is add a 128x128 sheet with a glass texture\
      \ in the middle of the enclosure. Then, I add a 120x120 brush (basically, around\
      \ minus 4-8 units of the original glass size) on both sides of the sheet (about\
      \ 2-4 units apart from the sheet on each side). Then, I make all the surfaces\

      \ in a level and liked it,how about to rooms 512x512x512 with a 32 unit gap,\
      \ then make a hole 256x256x32 now you have a 256x256 hole thats 32 deep, then\
      \ get a good texture and add a 255x255x32 brush and addit into the hole, then\
      \ set it to transparent or whatever you want, there you now a (BSP's worst enemy)\

      \ as the window hole, but half the thickness &ndash;  for this example, that's\
      \ 128x128x16.\n# place it in the window hole, centred so there's the same amount\
      \ of space in each side. (see picture) (and arg, if someone wants to rewrite\
      \ my lousy text, please please do)\n\n<br clear=all>\n\n====floating solid ====\n\
      \n<i>erm, this is one of the wackier ways of doing glass. it should get a mention,\
      \ but personally I don't touch it with a bargepole</i>\n\n'''Flashman:''' For\
      \ the record the 'Floating solid' method uses the same preparation steps as\
      \ above, but in place of the [[Legacy:Semisolid|semisolid]] sized 128x128x16,\
      \ make a cube brush sized 126x126x16 and then [[Legacy:Add Special|Add special\
      \ brush]] -> (Solid, Invisible) in the same position as before. The reson for\
      \ bringing the sides in alittle bit is that if the solid makes contact with\
      \ the windowframe then you'll get [[Legacy:Terminology|HOM]] on the area of\
      \ contact, as the engine thinks there's no surface there to render.\n\n'''''Arguments\
      \ for / against this method:'''''\n# A bot can 'see' through a semisolid, but\
      \ not a solid, for instance if your window points out to some lovely scenery,\
      \ then you might want to stop the bots having to calculate any possible threat\
      \ in this direction, as there's never going to be one, and likewise if it's\
      \ a window into another part of your level it would be wise to let your bots\
      \ 'see' through it in interests of fair play! :D\n# Semisolids don't make BSP\
      \ cuts, but in most cirumstances solids do. This is why semisolids are most\
      \ commonly used for pillars. If you use solids for pillars/in your windows and\
      \ find that you ''Node Ratio'' is high (generally more than 2) then switch to\
      \ semisolids\n\n''N.B. The Node Ratio is the ratio of BSP leaf Nodes to the\
      \ number of Polys in your map, and can be checked in the [[Legacy:Build Window|Build\
      \ Window]]. For more information on Leaf Nodes see [[Legacy:Node Count|Node\
      \ Count]]''\n\n====using BlockAll ====\n\nfor small windows it can be easier\
      \ to add a [[Legacy:BlockAll|BlockAll]] actor centred on the sheet.\n\n====\
      \ Using a Mover ===\n\nFirstly create your window as described in a “snug fit”\
      \ window but instead of using an ICH create a mover in exactly the same manner.\
      \  \n\nNow set the mover outside of your map (above your window opening) as\
      \ keyframe 1. \n\nNow in the mover properties there is a value called WorldRaytraceKey\
      \ this is the keyframe used to calculate where your mover casts its shadow.\
      \ If you set this to keyframe 1 and leave your mover in keyframe 0 there will\
      \ be no shadow cast by your window, allowing light through the opening giving\
      \ a more realistic appearance. \n\nset it's InitialState to TriggerToggle and\
      \ give the brush a tag.  Do not give it a trigger for it!\n\n===How Mappers\
      \ Make Their Glass===\n\n'''Bean:''' Here's my tutorial on making glass.\n\n\
      ''Example:'' Two 256x256x256 rooms(side by side) divided by a 128x128x64 cube\
      \ \"window enclosure\". What I do is add a 128x128 sheet with a glass texture\
      \ in the middle of the enclosure. Then, I add a 120x120 brush (basically, around\
      \ minus 4-8 units of the original glass size) on both sides of the sheet (about\
      \ 2-4 units apart from the sheet on each side). Then, I make all the surfaces\
      \ of those brushes invisible and the brushes themselves semi-solid (ya gettin\
      \ all this? :D).\n\n'''Craze:''' its not \"my\" way but i saw it in a level\
      \ and liked it,how about to rooms 512x512x512 with a 32 unit gap, then make\
      \ a hole 256x256x32 now you have a 256x256 hole thats 32 deep, then get a good\
      \ texture and add a 255x255x32 brush and addit into the hole, then set it to\
      \ transparent or whatever you want, there you now a (BSP's worst enemy) window\
      \ that wont give you a hall of mirrors if its see threw.\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
