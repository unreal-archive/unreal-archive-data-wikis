      <p>What to do if you have problems using U2XMP texture packs you created by\
      \ simply copying them?</p>\n<p>For example, you need MyTexture texture from\
      \ MyPackage.utx package. The workaround would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open MyPackage.utx\
      \ with UT2004 editor</li>\n<li>Right click MyTexture texture and choose rename</li>\n\
      <li>Change package name to MyPackage_temp (any different name is ok)</li>\n\
      <li>Do the same with all textures you want to use</li>\n<li>Save MyPackage_temp\
      \ package to disk</li>\n<li>Close unreal editor</li>\n<li>Delete MyPackage.utx\
      \ and rename MyPackage_temp.utx to MyPackage.utx</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now you have\
      \ working texture package, which is compatible with original one.</p>\n<p>It\
      \ seems that there are still some problems with DXT3 textures, causing them\
      \ to appear corrupted on older video cards.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"Static_meshes\">Static meshes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Converting_U2XMP_Map_To_UTXMP?section=3\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Static meshes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Every static mesh uses some texture packages. All\
      \ textures should be in your UT textures folder before using static meshes.</p>\n\
      <p>The simple way would be: import static mesh to UT UED with the same name\
      \ and pivot point as it had in U2XMP UED, and you can select_all/copy/paste\
      \ all meshes in level. The hard part is importing them. If they are original\
      \ U2XMP meshes, you have just open package which contains them. If they are\
      \ custom ones, you better have original 3dsmax or Maya models&#160;:). Of course,\
      \ you probably don't have them. So there is one way left, if you don't want\
      \ to remake them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Convert static mesh to brush</li>\n<li>Export\
      \ brush to file</li>\n<li>In UT UED prepare and open textures the brush uses</li>\n\
      <li>In UT UED import brush from file</li>\n<li>Convert brush to static mesh</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<p>have in mind that you may loose static mesh optimisations and/or smoothing\
      \ groups, so your meshes will look crappy.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The first thing that you have to do is to copy brushes,\
      \ or at least main cube brush.</p>\n<p>Before copying any brush, you must have\
      \ all textures with the same name the brush is using opened in UT UED (package\
      \ does not matter) in order them to be automatically assigned.</p>\n<p>If you\
      \ feel lucky, you can try to copy/paste (right click in top viewport and choose\
      \ \"paste to original location\") all brushes at once. However, there may be\
      \ problems with subtracted brushes and zone portals. You may have to delete\
