    text: "<p><b>DXT</b>, or <b>DXTC</b>, is a type of <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Compression\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Texture Compression\">texture compression</a>.</p>\n<p>According\
      \ to the UDN docs:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>DXTC is the native,\
      \ compressed texture format used in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX\"\
      \ class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:DirectX\">Wikipedia:DirectX</a> 8. In many\
      \ cases, DXTC reduces texture memory usage by 50% or more over palettized, 8-bit\
      \ textures, allowing for twice the textures at the same resolution, or the same\
      \ number of textures at twice the resolution. Three DXTC formats are available.</p>\n\
      </blockquote>\n<p>There are several types of DXT compression offered by DirectX\
      \ 8/9:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>DXT1</dt>\n<dd>0 or 1 bit alpha</dd>\n<dt>DXT2</dt>\n\
      <dd>Explicit 4-bit alpha, color data is premultiplied by alpha – <b>UnrealEd\
      \ does not use this format</b></dd>\n<dt>DXT3</dt>\n<dd>Explicit 4-bit alpha,\
      \ not premultiplied</dd>\n<dt>DXT4</dt>\n<dd>Interpolated alpha, color data\
      \ is premultiplied by alpha – <b>UnrealEd does not use this format</b></dd>\n\
      <dt>DXT5</dt>\n<dd>Interpolated alpha, not premultiplied</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>In\
      \ DXT compression, images are divided into 4x4 pixel blocks, or \"texels\".\
      \ For each texel, two color values are chosen to represent the range of pixel\
      \ colors within that block, and then each pixel is mapped to one of four possible\
      \ colors (two bits) within that range. The compressed texel is represented by\
      \ the two 16-bit color values, and 16 2-bit pixel values, totalling 64 bits\
      \ of data per texel, amounting to an overall image size of 4 bits per pixel.</p>\n\
      <p>Alpha (transparency) information in DXT is handled in one of several ways,\
      \ depending on the DXT format. In DXT1, each texel can either be defined as\
      \ having four possible color values within the range (as described above), or\
      \ alternately three color values and one value indicating \"this pixel is transparent\"\
      . Thus, in DXT1, one can have at most 1-bit (on or off) transparency in the\
      \ image, but even this is done at the expense of some color information. <b>Note:</b>\
      \ DXT1 transparency is supported by the Engine and UnrealEd but you can't use\
      \ UnrealEd GUI to create DXT1 textures with one-bit alpha. Textures converted\
      \ to DXT1 have all transparency information removed.</p>\n<p>In DXT2/3/4/5,\
      \ Alpha information is specified using a second 64-bit block for each texel\
      \ (thus doubling the image size). In DXT2/3, for each pixel, four bits are used\
      \ to indicate its alpha, providing 16 different transparency levels. DXT4/5\
      \ uses a method similar to the way color data is stored to provide \"interpolated\"\
      \ alpha information: Two (8-bit) alpha values are chosen representing the range\
      \ of transparency in that texel, and then for each pixel, three bits are used\
      \ to represent its transparency within that defined range (This allows much\
      \ better for subtle gradations, but can have less precision for large ranges\
      \ within a texel).</p>\n<p>In DXT2 and DXT4, the pixel color values are multiplied\
      \ by the alpha values before compressing (so partially transparent pixels have\
      \ a color value stored darker than it shows onscreen, and completely transparent\
      \ pixels always have a color value of black in the compressed texture). This\
      \ can speed up some types of compositing operations, but it has the side-effect\
      \ of losing color information, and can result in uglier DXT compression for\
      \ some types of textures. In any case, alpha premultiplication is not supported\
      \ by current Unreal Engine versions, so DXT2 and DXT4 are not options for texture\
      \ formats in UnrealEd (so you can forget they exist).</p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"\

    text: "'''DXT''', or '''DXTC''', is a type of [[Legacy:Texture Compression|texture\
      \ compression]].\n\nAccording to the UDN docs:\n\n{{innerbox| DXTC is the native,\
      \ compressed texture format used in [[Wikipedia:DirectX]] 8. In many cases,\
      \ DXTC reduces texture memory usage by 50% or more over palettized, 8-bit textures,\
      \ allowing for twice the textures at the same resolution, or the same number\
      \ of textures at twice the resolution. Three DXTC formats are available. \n\n\
      }}\n\nThere are several types of DXT compression offered by DirectX 8/9:\n;\
      \ DXT1: 0 or 1 bit alpha\n; DXT2: Explicit 4-bit alpha, color data is premultiplied\
      \ by alpha &ndash; '''UnrealEd does not use this format'''\n; DXT3: Explicit\
      \ 4-bit alpha, not premultiplied\n; DXT4: Interpolated alpha, color data is\
      \ premultiplied by alpha &ndash; '''UnrealEd does not use this format'''\n;\
      \ DXT5: Interpolated alpha, not premultiplied\n\nIn DXT compression, images\
      \ are divided into 4x4 pixel blocks, or \"texels\".  For each texel, two color\
      \ values are chosen to represent the range of pixel colors within that block,\
      \ and then each pixel is mapped to one of four possible colors (two bits) within\
      \ that range.  The compressed texel is represented by the two 16-bit color values,\
      \ and 16 2-bit pixel values, totalling 64 bits of data per texel, amounting\
      \ to an overall image size of 4 bits per pixel.\n\nAlpha (transparency) information\
      \ in DXT is handled in one of several ways, depending on the DXT format.  In\
      \ DXT1, each texel can either be defined as having four possible color values\
      \ within the range (as described above), or alternately three color values and\
      \ one value indicating \"this pixel is transparent\".  Thus, in DXT1, one can\
      \ have at most 1-bit (on or off) transparency in the image, but even this is\
      \ done at the expense of some color information.  '''Note:''' DXT1 transparency\
      \ is supported by the Engine and UnrealEd but you can't use UnrealEd GUI to\
      \ create DXT1 textures with one-bit alpha.  Textures converted to DXT1 have\
      \ all transparency information removed.\n\nIn DXT2/3/4/5, Alpha information\
      \ is specified using a second 64-bit block for each texel (thus doubling the\
      \ image size).  In DXT2/3, for each pixel, four bits are used to indicate its\
      \ alpha, providing 16 different transparency levels.  DXT4/5 uses a method similar\
      \ to the way color data is stored to provide \"interpolated\" alpha information:\
      \ Two (8-bit) alpha values are chosen representing the range of transparency\
      \ in that texel, and then for each pixel, three bits are used to represent its\
      \ transparency within that defined range (This allows much better for subtle\
      \ gradations, but can have less precision for large ranges within a texel).\n\
      \nIn DXT2 and DXT4, the pixel color values are multiplied by the alpha values\
      \ before compressing (so partially transparent pixels have a color value stored\
      \ darker than it shows onscreen, and completely transparent pixels always have\
      \ a color value of black in the compressed texture).  This can speed up some\
      \ types of compositing operations, but it has the side-effect of losing color\
      \ information, and can result in uglier DXT compression for some types of textures.\
      \  In any case, alpha premultiplication is not supported by current Unreal Engine\
      \ versions, so DXT2 and DXT4 are not options for texture formats in UnrealEd\
      \ (so you can forget they exist).\n\n==Which DXT Compression to Use?==\n\nObviously,\
      \ there are some trade-offs between the different formats which make them better\
      \ or worse for different types of images.  Some general rules of thumb for good\
      \ use of DXT textures are as follows:\n\n# If your image has no alpha, use DXT1\
      \ compression.  Using DXT3/5 will double your image size over DXT1 and not gain\
      \ anything.\n# If your image has 1-bit (on or off) alpha information, use DXT1\
      \ with one-bit alpha. If the DXT1 image quality is too low and you don't mind\
      \ doubling image size, use DXT3 or DXT5 (which one doesn't matter, they'll give\
      \ the same results). \n# If your image has smooth gradations of alpha (fading\
      \ in/out slowly), DXT5 is almost certainly your best bet, as it will give you\
      \ the most accurate transparency representation.\n# If your image has sharp\
      \ transitions between multiple alpha levels (one pixel is 100%, the next one\
      \ is 50%, and another neighbor is 12%), DXT3 is probably your best bet.  You\
      \ may want to compare the alpha results in DXT1, DXT3 and DXT5 compression,\
      \ however, to make sure.\n\n==Notes==\n\nIn UnrealEd 3, RGBA8 and P8 textures\
      \ can be compressed to DXT1, DXT3, or DXT5 by right-clicking on the texture\
