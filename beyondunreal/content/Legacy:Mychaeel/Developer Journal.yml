      <p>Incidentally I dug out the code I scratched in the first entry on this page\
      \ and used it for a related, but different purpose where it actually fits in.\
      \ (Good thing I never really delete something for good unless I'm <i>absolutely</i>\
      \ sure it won't ever be of any use anymore.)</p>\n<p>The code is part of Jailbreak's\
      \ bot support and is supposed to let bots make an educated guess where an enemy\
      \ player is currently located after the enemy gave his position away by triggering\
      \ a release switch. Naturally, if there's only a single relase switch, all that\
      \ boils down to a single possible location. Where it gets interesting is if\
      \ there are <i>multiple</i> release switches and the bots actually have to <i>guess</i>\
      \ which one the player triggered.</p>\n<p>My code does that based on the last\
      \ known location of a player (directly after a round starts, or after a spawn\
      \ in freedom after winning an arena match, or after being released from jail),\
      \ the walking distance (using the path network) to all of the release switches\
      \ and the time that passed since the player's location was known last. With\
      \ that and a more or less arbitrarily chosen probability distribution for a\
      \ player's distance from his starting point after a given amount of time (something\
      \ based on half a Gaussian) bots take a random guess weighed by the respective\
      \ probability of the enemy being at any of the possible switches.</p>\n<h2><span\

      <p>I figured out the hard way that even custom game types can't simply replace\
      \ the game's <a href=\"/Legacy:TeamInfo\" title=\"Legacy:TeamInfo\">TeamInfo</a>\
      \ actors by subclassing <a href=\"/Legacy:XTeamRoster\" title=\"Legacy:XTeamRoster\"\
      >xTeamRoster</a>. One of our bug hunters reported that setting up a game with\
      \ custom bots broke crucial parts of the gameplay, and a look into the log revealed\
      \ that UT2003 didn't use Jailbreak's custom TeamInfo subclass as configured\
      \ in the the game type's DefaultEnemyRosterClass variable but instances of <a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:TeamBlueConfigured?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"\
      Legacy:TeamBlueConfigured (page does not exist)\">TeamBlueConfigured</a> and\
      \ <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:TeamRedConfigured?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"\
      Legacy:TeamRedConfigured (page does not exist)\">TeamRedConfigured</a> instead.</p>\n\
      <p>So, once more, I'm ending up <i>attaching</i> an actor of mine to a stock\
      \ UT2003 actor instead of replacing the stock actor's class by my own. Jailbreak\
      \ did so with several other gameplay-relevant classes (not just TeamInfo) before\
      \ already – PlayerReplicationInfo, for one, instead of introducing a custom\
      \ PlayerReplicationInfo subclass.</p>\n<p>In Unreal Tournament \"attaching\"\
      \ an actor to another actor was more or less limited to the possibility of setting\
      \ the attached actor's owner to the actor it was attached to and then using\
      \ the ChildActors iterator to retrieve the attached actor when requested. (Or\
      \ any variant of that, though those that come into my mind are all equally inefficient.)</p>\n\
      <p>In UT2003 however every actor can have its own inventory by means of the\
      \ Inventory variable which is declared in class <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Actor\">Actor</a>. Traveling an actor's inventory chain is fast and efficient\
      \ compared to using an iterator, so I implemented a generic abstract superclass\
      \ for info actors that are \"attached\" to another actor, including code that\
      \ automatically sets up a linked list of all \"actor tag\" actors of the same\
      \ class and a mechanism that, if so desired, communicates registration and unregistration\
      \ of an \"actor tag\" to all clients even during its lifetime.</p>\n<p>Well,\
      \ anyway, the TeamInfo problem was quickly fixed thanks to that mechanism.</p>\n\

      \ noticed that I had to change a remotely related part of the code in order\
      \ to avoid some small lag in a visual effect – no big deal, but something that\
      \ deserved to be fixed. So I opened the class responsible for the delay, found\
      \ the place where I had not anticipated the need for some direct connection\
      \ between two pieces of code in my original design, and added it.</p>\n<p>Then\
      \ I realized that this was the third or fourth time I had added a bit of code\
      \ at that place to accommodate a new requirement that had popped up since I\
      \ had initially designed that class. Each time I had addressed a small particular\
      \ problem, each time I had added a bit of code to fix it; and while each of\
      \ those changes were small and simple, the whole code grew more complicated\
      \ and less elegant with every change I applied to it.</p>\n<p>Time to scratch\
      \ that part of the code and rethink its design with all old <i>and</i> new requirements\
      \ in mind.</p>\n<p>Changing, fixing and tweaking code a small part at a time\
      \ inevitably leads to bloated, unelegant, bug-prone constructions sooner or\

      \ that adding, testing and debugging a new feature becomes almost as much work\
      \ as rewriting everything from scratch. It's a developer's nightmare.</p>\n\
      <p>So sometimes it really pays off to start redesigning parts of a program before\
      \ feature creep sets in. The difficult part is to realize that before it's too\
      \ late; and even more so for people not directly involved in the development\
      \ process who can't relate to the idea of elegant, straightforward and bug-resistant\
      \ program design. Coding for a mod whose development is being slowly ground\

      \ ElapsedTime and decreases RemainingTime once per second all by itself. Sounds\

      \ – and that's not just in Jailbreak, it's exactly the same in vanilla Deathmatch.\

      \ or Epic must have anticipated some of those problems though, because it actually\
      \ gets a bit more complicated than what I described above. In addition to ElapsedTime\

      \ every time it is changed. The Timer event in <a href=\"/Legacy:DeathMatch\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:DeathMatch\">DeathMatch</a> sets it to the current value of\
      \ RemainingTime every full minute. GameReplicationInfo in turn picks it up and\

      \ thus re-syncronizing RemainingTime with the game's actual time.</p>\n<p>Since\
      \ I'd like Jailbreak's spiffy game time clock in the scoreboard to show the\
      \ right time at <i>all</i> times though I guess I'll have to look for a fix.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Update:</b> Two distinct problems there: Firstly, the initially replicated\

      \ a pause in a network game. The client's countdown clock rapidly counts down\
      \ the seconds that have passed while the match was paused. While I am certain\
      \ the remaining time on the server has indeed been paused, it seems that the\
      \ client thinks it knows better and catches up. The weird thing is that the\

      \ In network games that means that those positions have to be replicated to\

      \ the locations are updated only every couple of frames, not every (client-side)\
      \ frame.</p>\n<p>That problem can be somewhat relieved by using the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Pawn\" title=\"Legacy:Pawn\">Pawns</a>' actual positions when they happen\
      \ to be present on the respective client; but the other player positions still\
      \ jerk. Some sort of motion prediction or motion interpolation should be built\
      \ in; and preferably in a way that does not multiply the bandwidth requirements\
      \ of the whole separate location replication business – my bandwidth conscience\
      \ is striking already without that. That rules out simply replicating the player's\
      \ velocity along with their position.</p>\n<p>Since the minimap is by design\
      \ mini, the updates usually don't go beyond a movement of a couple of pixels\

      \ frequency of the position updates and interpolates between the <i>last two</i>\
      \ replicated known points (and beyond if the next update isn't received in time)\

      <p>The principle works, but the movement is still jerky. Motion prediction doesn't\
      \ work well because the time that passes between a replicated variable being\
      \ set on server-side and its new value being received client-side varies wildly:\
      \ So even when the player is moving in a straight line at a constant velocity,\
      \ the client-side predicted location has to be corrected with every update.</p>\n\
      <p>Now I'm pursuing a different idea – adding the received location updates\
      \ to a client-side list and trying to have the client interpolate along that\
      \ list of locations, choosing its velocity independently as to keep up with\
      \ the succession of new locations that are added to the list.</p>\n<p>When the\
      \ client-side interpolated location information reaches the last known location\
      \ in the list and the player is not known to have stopped moving server-side,\
      \ it extrapolates the player's movement using the last known direction and velocity.\
      \ That can even be used to save bandwidth: The server only sends another update\
      \ when it expects the client-side extrapolation to have deviated from the player's\
      \ actual location too much.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"May_25.2C_2003\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>To my mild surprise what I've implemented now works\
      \ much better than I had dared to hope.</p>\n<p>The server sends occasional\
      \ location updates to all clients; and in addition to that, the absolute value\
      \ of the player's movement velocity. The <i>direction</i> of the player's movement\
      \ is derived from the succession of location updates; as described in the previous\
      \ entry it's impractical to derive the velocity as well from the location updates\
      \ because time differences can't be relied upon when network replication is\
      \ concerned.</p>\n<p>Using the absolute value of the player's velocity instead\
      \ of the velocity vector itself saves some bandwidth – two thirds in the size\
      \ of the replicated data item alone (vector consists of three floats, its absolute\
      \ value of only one), and it's also much less likely to change (the absolute\
      \ value remains the same even when the player changes his movement direction\
      \ or strafes).</p>\n<p>Still, with every location update there's bound to be\
      \ a small deviation between the client-side extrapolated location and the updated\
      \ absolute location sent by the server. Client-side, that deviation is simply\
      \ smoothed out on a short time scale – that way the client-side motion simulation\
      \ never suffers of any jerking motions, only small variations in movement speed\
      \ which are virtually impossible to notice.</p>\n<p>What I haven't implemented\
      \ yet is the aforementioned optimization of location updates when a player keeps\
      \ moving on a straight line for a while, thus making the client-side linear\
      \ extrapolation sufficiently accurate even for longer periods between updates.\
      \ No actual player does that in a firefight, of course; but it's not all that\
      \ unlikely to happen in general, especially given that without that optimization\
      \ location updates would be sent with a frequency of about five times per second.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Update:</b> Reducing the number of location updates that way works fine\
      \ as well. When moving on a straight line several seconds may pass between two\
      \ location updates while the client-side minimap location indicator still accurately\
      \ shows the moving player's constantly changing location, smoothly picking up\
      \ a later change in the player's movement direction.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Would it still be fun if there weren't always more\
      \ problems awaiting a solution?</p>\n<p>When reading my code again I realized\
      \ that it wasn't at all robust against server-side updates that never reached\
      \ a particular client. While the mechanism doesn't rely on the time between\
      \ two received updates anymore, it still assumes that the client gets to see\
      \ every update the server sends – and that may not necessarily be the case.\
      \ If the client misses one update, the client's idea of the player's movement\
      \ direction will be completely off, especially since the server already sends\
      \ only the minimum amount of updates that can be used to derive the direction.</p>\n\
      <p>So I have to make sure that the engine itself takes care that all clients\
      \ always have a consistent set of information – the engine must know that if\
      \ a client misses one or several updates it is necessary to send the last <i>two</i>\
      \ location updates to that client next time. The easiest way to achieve that\
      \ is by having two replicated location variables that are alternatingly set\
      \ to the player's most current location – the other one then contains the location\
      \ one step earlier.</p>\n<p>However, the problem isn't completely solved already\
      \ by that. Since those two variables (a two-element array, actually) are set\
      \ alternatingly server-side (so that on each step only one of the values changes\
      \ and has to be replicated), the client has no way to know which of the two\
      \ replicated locations is the most current one – and so it can only derive the\
      \ axis on which the player is moving, but not whether the player is moving \"\
      forward\" or \"backward\" on that axis. The client needs one bit of extra information\
      \ to resolve that ambiguity.</p>\n<p>It's not as trivial as it may sound to\
      \ derive a consistent notion of \"forward\" or \"backward\" for any given non-zero\
      \ vector. Simply trying to define \"forward\" and \"backward\" in respect to\
      \ a certain fixed direction is ambiguous as soon as a vector is lying in the\
      \ plane perpendicular to the chosen direction; so that won't work (or rather,\
      \ it will, but only in <i>almost</i> all cases, which is unfortunately not enough\
      \ – Murphy knows). So, the method I've chosen to define \"forward\" and \"backward\"\
      \ takes the signum of the first vector component (X, Y, or Z, in that order)\
      \ that is not zero – that's guaranteed to be non-zero for any non-zero vector,\
      \ and the resultant value changes its own sign when the vector does.</p>\n<p>To\
      \ sum it up, the client now has <i>two</i> replicated location values without\
      \ knowing which one is the most current one; so it calculates the vector difference\
      \ between those two and applies the notion of \"forward\" or \"backward\" on\
      \ it (described above), checks it against the separately replicated bit of information\
      \ sent by the server and changes the vector's sign if necessary. And Bob's your\
      \ uncle. (See what Terry Pratchett does to one's vocabulary?)</p>\n<p>But...\
      \ wouldn't it have been much easier and just as effective if I had simply replicated\
      \ an extra bit of information telling the client which of the two locations\
      \ is the most current one, instead of laboriously introducing weird notions\
      \ of \"forward\" and \"backward\" vectors? – Easier it would be but not as effective.\
      \ That bit would have to be changed every single time the server does an update\
      \ even if the player only made a slight correction in his movement direction;\
      \ the method I've chosen only changes that bit when the player's movement direction\
      \ changes from \"forward\" to \"backward\" (in the special absolute sense described\
      \ above), so it only <i>occasionally</i> requires a change instead of <i>always</i>.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Addendum:</b> I actually have it implemented by replicating that extra\
      \ bit of orientation information as <i>the velocity's signum</i> – in an attempt\
      \ to save bandwidth when both velocity and orientation change at the same time\
      \ (and it also wouldn't take any more bandwidth when the velocity alone changes).\
      \ Upon writing about it here it suddenly occurred to me that this maybe wasn't\
      \ all that smart after all – if <i>only</i> the orientation changes but the\
      \ velocity doesn't, the engine still has to replicate an entire float value\
      \ even though only a single bit changed. Would it be more efficient to go the\
      \ straightforward way and use a separately replicated bool variable? I'll keep\
      \ a close eye on which updates actually need to be sent by the server in a real-game\
      \ situation and decide then...</p>\n<p>(And that's also why writing in this\
      \ \"developer journal\" is worth the effort even if nobody's actually reading\
      \ it – it makes me critically review what I've coded. It's a one-person code\
      \ audit, so to speak.)</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"May_30.2C_2003\"\

      \ a rectangular black background, not even for performance's sake.</p>\n<p>Maybe\
      \ there is a way to use alpha transparency on a ScriptedTexture. During my experiments\

      \ the ScriptedTexture's alpha plane – it seems that wherever DrawPortal renders\
      \ a normal solid texture, the ScriptedTexture will be completely transparent,\
      \ but where an alpha-masked texture is drawn on the ScriptedTexture by DrawPortal\
      \ the ScriptedTexture adopts its alpha mask there. It's all pretty strange.</p>\n\
      <p>I also remember that in Unreal Tournament a ScriptedTexture could have a\
      \ \"background texture\" that was used to initialize the ScriptedTexture canvas\
      \ every frame. I haven't found a corresponding property in UT2003's ScriptedTexture\

      \ implementing something a challenge; it's the <i>pathological</i> cases that\
      \ do.</p>\n<p>The obvious step after implementing an HTML parser is creating\
      \ a formatter for the parsed HTML element tree. The old one I made for <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Screen\" title=\"Legacy:Screen\">Screen</a> (one of my first UnrealScript\
      \ projects altogether) has no concept of tables or floating boxes, but this\
      \ time I'm determined to add support for those and so I have to deal with the\
      \ conceptual odds and ends that come with it.</p>\n<p>A floating box is actually\
      \ a pretty straightforward concept: It's a rectangle that's placed at the left\
      \ or right edge of the containing box starting at the vertical position of the\
      \ text line it's defined in. That technique is most commonly used to have text\
      \ flow around an image on a website.</p>\n<p>Normally, a web designer adds floating\
      \ elements at the very start of a paragraph so the boxes are placed already\
      \ when the formatter starts wrapping lines between them.</p>\n<p>The beginning\
      \ of a paragraph is, however, not the only valid place for floating boxes: They\
      \ can just as well be defined in the middle of a line, and that's where the\
      \ trouble starts. As long as the current line is short enough to fit next to\
      \ the box, everything is still fine; just add the floating box and shorten the\
      \ line box accordingly.</p>\n<p>But what if the floating box is too wide to\
      \ fit next to the text line where it's defined in? The HTML standards document\
      \ says that the box is then to start directly <i>below</i> the line it is defined\
      \ in; that's simple enough to implement... but subsequent text after the definition\
      \ of the floating box is still to be added to the very same line <i>above</i>\
      \ the box, and according to Murphy's law somebody is bound to have some item\
      \ in that line after the floating box definition that increases its line height.\
      \ That means, basically, that the absolute position of the floating box may\
      \ not be completely determined at the time it is added. Consequently, it may\
      \ be necessary to shift the box down <i>after</i> it has been rendered.</p>\n\

      \ I had been working on for the last year (and which had kept me off anything\
      \ Unreal-related for the last two months). For those interested, it's about\
      \ <i>Metal-Induced Crystallization of Silicon-Germanium Layers</i> – fundamental\
      \ research for the next ('third') generation of solar cells which will be far\
      \ more efficient and much cheaper to produce than what's currently on the market.</p>\n\
      <p>Well. <i>[takes a deep breath]</i> This concludes more than half a decade\
      \ of studies of mine at the Technische Universität München (I recently learned\
      \ that they attach great importance to not being called \"Technical University\
      \ Munich\" or something like that even on the cover sheet of English-language\
      \ publications such as my thesis). I guess it'll take a couple of days until\
      \ I have really, deeply grasped the significance of this. Right now, I'm mostly\
      \ just relieved, happy, and tired.</p>\n<p>One thing is sure, though: I'm ready\
      \ to get back into the Unreal community. Even though I had been preoccupied\
      \ by other things, I've really missed it. &#160;:-) It'll take me a few days\

      \ (and stress-tested successfully on MyUnreal's ever-full server), and so are\
      \ the \"web admin does not come up again after level change\" and \"server does\
      \ not react to UDP requests after a while\" bugs. Those were the toughest ones\
      \ to crack, mostly because I was fixing in the dark; the others were, while\
      \ partly annoying, peanuts.</p>\n<p>In retrospect it seems that the latter two\
      \ bugs stemmed from the engine not fully cleaning up the previous level; and\
      \ that, in turn, was apparently due to my storing some actor references in the\
      \ <i>class default</i> values of a class – I did that only to compare the stored\
      \ references to given ones for caching a function's return value over subsequent\
      \ calls. Even if the actors were destroyed between two calls, I'd expect a comparison\
      \ simply to fail.</p>\n<p>After I worked around that problem (by storing the\
      \ actors' locations in the cache – in this case that worked just as well), suddenly\
      \ those both bugs (web server not coming up again, UdpGameSpyQuery failing to\

      \ Perhaps this behaviour is limited to certain classes?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Perhaps, but I don't think so. The effect of doing that is hardly noticable\
      \ in local testing conditions, in any case (otherwise I'd have seen it a lot\
      \ earlier) – as I wrote, the most noticable effect was that the web admin <a\

      \ get cleaned up on level change and that – after many level changes – a server\

      \ usual issues with storing <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\"\
      >Actor</a> references in them apply. I'm somewhat surprised it didn't crash.\
      \ Perhaps because the engine doesn't actually destroy the class objects as it\

      \ Jailbreak game so it wouldn't ever unload the resources.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ Frankly, I wasn't ever aware of \"the usual issues\" with storing Actor references\
      \ in non-Actor objects – Jailbreak code still does that on several occasions\
      \ (<a href=\"/Legacy:LevelInfo\" title=\"Legacy:LevelInfo\">LevelInfo</a> and\

      <p><b>Mysterial:</b> <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\">Actor</a>\
      \ references in non-Actor subclasses don't get automatically cleaned up by the\

      \ since part of garbage collection is traversing every object reference property\
      \ that exists, you need to clean up any such references before a level change\
      \ or you'll either get frequent serialization crashes or prevent the previous\
      \ level from unloading, creating huge memory leaks, as you unfortunately found\

      <p>With the stress of releasing Jailbreak over, I'm free to look into some of\
      \ my old mutator ideas again. One of them is <b>SprayPaint</b> – a simple idea\
      \ actually, borrowed from Half Life where the ability to spray-paint your clan\
      \ logo on walls was built-in functionality. I want to port that idea to UT2004.</p>\n\
      <p>This would be pretty straight-forward and quite uninteresting if I hadn't\
      \ put it into my mind that it should be possible to customize the spray-painted\
      \ images by simply dropping a BMP file (1-bit, 64x64 pixels) into a directory;\
      \ and, if that's done by a client in a network game, all other clients should\
      \ be able to see the same image too. The latter is just some replication acrobatics;\
      \ the former is where I saw my challenge.</p>\n<p>Reading arbitrary files in\
      \ UnrealScript isn't really supported, but if you need to do it for text files,\
      \ instantiating a <a href=\"/Legacy:WebResponse\" title=\"Legacy:WebResponse\"\
      >WebResponse</a> object and using its LoadParsedUHTM function works quite well.\
      \ However, UnrealScript strings aren't binary safe – null bytes act as end-of-string\
      \ tokens and thus cannot be included in a string. Attempting to load a binary\
      \ file such as a BMP image with LoadParsedUHTM results in a byte string truncated\
      \ at the first null byte.</p>\n<p>I've worked around that problem now by spawning\
      \ a local <a href=\"/Legacy:WebServer\" title=\"Legacy:WebServer\">WebServer</a>\
      \ listening on a random free port, delivering files as \"application/octet-stream\"\
      \ with WebResponse's function IncludeBinaryFile, and a <a href=\"/Legacy:TcpLink\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:TcpLink\">TcpLink</a> operating in MODE_Binary to receive the\
      \ binary data from the local web server. In theory this setup is able to read\
      \ the contents of any binary file within the UT2004 directory hierarchy into\
      \ an UnrealScript byte array, and it's working great for my purposes.</p>\n\

      <p>Picking up my old SprayPaint mutator idea again. To reiterate, it's about\
      \ being able to spray logos on walls – the logos must be provided as monochrome\
      \ bitmaps (i.e. bitmaps with 1-bit color depth) in a certain UT2004 subdirectory,\
      \ and you can spray them on walls in a color of your choice; and the best thing\
      \ is that other players on the server would see the exact same thing even though\
      \ they don't have the source bitmap on their system. On the long run I even\
      \ want the sprayed images to persist across matches.</p>\n<p>There's a bit of\
      \ replication acrobatics involved in making that work, but so far it works nicely\
      \ – the data is loaded client-side, transmitted to the server via a replicated\
      \ function in \"bunches\" of no more than 64 bytes a tick, and then left to\
      \ the engine to be replicated back to all (non-bNetOwner) clients.</p>\n<p>Two\
      \ things I noticed doing that were that, firstly, the engine only replicates\
      \ the first 256 bytes of an array of 512 byte values (where I don't know exactly\
      \ whether it's the number of elements or their total size which is limited by\
      \ the engine); and secondly, that passing a byte array via a replicated function\
      \ call will only actually replicate the first value of that array, not the entire\
      \ array. However, if the array is part of a struct which is passed through the\
      \ replicated function, everything works fine (hence my \"bunches\" of data).</p>\n\
      <p>The user interface for that thing is keeping me thinking. Right now I figure\
      \ that pressing your usual \"talk\" key (\"T\", for instance) quickly twice\
      \ in a row (like a double-click) would pop up a window where you could select\
      \ which image to spray (using the mouse or arrow/movement keys), but that idea\
      \ is subject to change. For now, the \"mutate SprayImage &lt;filename&gt; &lt;color&gt;\"\
      \ console command does the trick.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ today I got ISDN and DSL activated. Thus, JDN is up again – whatever caused\
      \ my computer to break down two weeks ago is mysterious to me. Maybe my video\
      \ card overheated after all after having been running non-stop for months without\
      \ a monitor attached to it... still, not really a satisfactory explanation.</p>\n\
      <p>Now that my home computer has been hosting CVS, an Apache webserver with\
      \ JDN and other services and an ISDN calling machine and fax server for quite\
      \ a while and across several hardware updates, I've been thinking – it's getting\
      \ harder and harder to keep the noise level coming from this machine at a level\
      \ I'm willing to bear in my living room. Plus, most of the time the computer\
      \ is merely converting electric power into noise and heat via a video card and\
      \ processor which are ridiculously overpowered for something acting as a web/fax/CVS\
      \ server most of the time.</p>\n<p>...so – *drumroll* – I've got that fabulous\
      \ idea of building a small machine out of spare parts mostly left over from\
      \ hardware upgrades of my main PC over the years. I've got two mainboards/processors\
      \ to choose from (a Pentium 200 MHz and an Athlon 800 MHz which I could underclock\
      \ to 500 MHz), some left-over RAM, an ethernet card (my latest mainboard had\
      \ that on-board) and a simple video card (an ATI XPert@Work sporting a 3D chipset\
      \ with the staggering amount of 8 MB VRAM). I also have a midi-tower computer\
      \ case somewhere. What I need is a silent power supply and – probably – a new\
      \ harddisk (especially if this thing is to act as a file server as well) unless\
      \ I find a suitable one in my pile of used hardware.</p>\n<p>I figure I'll install\
      \ Debian Linux on it – with that awesome 3 MBit/s downstream I've got I can\
      \ even download it without much hassle.</p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> Wow. Silent 80\
      \ GB harddisks come for less than 60 EUR these days? o_O</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      *cough*</p>\n<p>Remember the Palpable mutator for Unreal Tournament? Probably\
      \ not, because I never actually released it, and the BuF mess-up two years ago\
      \ ate all remaining evidence for it.</p>\n<p>Basically, it allowed the user\
      \ to see stereo 3D by displaying two versions of the current scene rendered\
      \ from slightly different points of view. You had to squint to see the effect,\
      \ just like for <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.brossco.fi/janne/eclipse99/budapest/bu_3d.html\"\
      >these photos</a>.</p>\n<p>I tried to implement the same thing for UT2004 on\
      \ Sunday. To the degree that two viewports were rendered on the screen next\
      \ to each other, it was a piece of cake; but, having the HUD render within one\
      \ of those viewports prove to be impossible. In Unreal Tournament, it was basically\
      \ just a matter of setting <a href=\"/Legacy:Canvas\" title=\"Legacy:Canvas\"\
      >Canvas</a>.OrgX/OrgY and ClipX/ClipY right – but UT2004's HUD makes heavy use\
      \ of the native DrawSpriteWidget function which, while honoring OrgX/OrgY and\
      \ ClipX/ClipY, doesn't take the reduced size of a viewport defined through those\
      \ properties into account when positioning and scaling the widgets.</p>\n<p>So,\
      \ no way. Well, it was just an experiment anyway. The 3D effect itself is pretty\
      \ cool, though, even if it strains the eyes to squint that way for an extended\
      \ period of time...</p>\n<p>In other news, after a period of consideration,\

      \ those digital pianos nowadays really do sound and feel like the real thing\
      \ – down to subtle details like the slight resonance you hear after releasing\

      external text\" href=\"http://www.planetjailbreak.com/?news=275\">PlanetJailbreak\
      \ news</a> are aware of what I've been working on recently: the visuals of freezing\
      \ and shattering a player model. Part of the problem is to overlay the player\
      \ model and the weapon it holds with an \"ice\" texture that gradually fades\
      \ in.</p>\n<p>My first idea was creating a <a href=\"/Legacy:Shader\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Shader\">Shader</a>, setting its <code>Diffuse</code> material to the\
      \ player's skin texture, the <code>Specular</code> material to my alpha-blended\
      \ \"ice\" texture and use a <a href=\"/Legacy:ConstantColor\" title=\"Legacy:ConstantColor\"\
      >ConstantColor</a> as its <code>SpecularityMask</code> material to control the\
      \ fading. That works fine for the player model, but utterly fails for the weapon\
      \ – the weapon's textures are implicitly defined through the mesh, and there's\
      \ no way UnrealScript code can get hold of them (not even anything similar to\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Dynamicly_Accessing_Original_Static_Mesh_Textures\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Dynamicly Accessing Original Static Mesh Textures\">this method</a>).</p>\n\
      <p>So, that approach fell somewhat short of what I had envisioned.</p>\n<p>But\
      \ there's <code>OverlayMaterial</code> defined in <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Actor\">Actor</a>, along with a <code>SetOverlayMaterial</code>\
      \ method, which is used (among others) by the UDamage to produce that \"energy\"\
      \ overlay effect on players and weapons. I had previously found out already\
      \ that using a plain texture as <code>OverlayMaterial</code> will simply replace\
      \ the model's skin by that texture (instead of overlaying it) – not what I intended,\
      \ so I had put that approach aside. Now, I picked it up again.</p>\n<p>After\
      \ some lucky experimentation, I found that I was able to use a <a href=\"/Legacy:Shader\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Shader\">Shader</a> as an <code>OverlayMaterial</code> whose\
      \ <code>Specular</code> material was set to my \"ice\" texture. Funnily, I noted\
      \ that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>Diffuse</code> material I tried to set was\
      \ automatically overwritten with a reference to the overlaid actor's skin (the\
      \ skin part with the highest ordinal number in the meshmap, I guess). So, here's\
      \ a way to find the original skins of a non-static mesh if you need to.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>A</code> (alpha) member of the <code>Color</code>\
      \ property of a <a href=\"/Legacy:ConstantColor\" title=\"Legacy:ConstantColor\"\
      >ConstantColor</a> material I tried to use as the shader's <code>SpecularityMask</code>\
      \ was immediately reset to zero whenever I attempted to set it to something\
      \ different. Why would the engine do such a thing...?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, that\
      \ didn't work the way I had it intended to. Neither did any attempts to replace\
      \ the plain \"ice\" texture in the <code>Specular</code> slot by a <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Modifier\" title=\"Legacy:Modifier\">Modifier</a> of any kind.</p>\n\
      <p>Then, in a last futile attempt, I tried using a <a href=\"/Legacy:FadeColor\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:FadeColor\">FadeColor</a> in the <code>SpecularityMask</code>\
      \ slot (instead of a <a href=\"/Legacy:ConstantColor\" title=\"Legacy:ConstantColor\"\
      >ConstantColor</a> as before), and lo!, when I set its <code>FadePeriod</code>\
      \ to something other than the default, zero, it worked! Well, of course I had\
      \ a pulsing overlay now, but setting both <code>Color1</code> and <code>Color2</code>\
      \ to the same color fixed that.</p>\n<p>So, now I've got a texture overlay on\
      \ both player and weapon which I can smoothly fade in (and out, if there was\
      \ any need) and which still lets the original textures shine through.</p>\n\

      \ got around it by failing to customize your workspace too much. I didn't fall\
      \ into the second group, and it took me until today to become part of the first.</p>\n\
      <p>I'm developing a small smartphone application to remote-control MP3 playback\
      \ on the Linux server which sits quietly in my closet via Bluetooth.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ <i>Smartphone 2003 SDK</i> comes with a smartphone emulator. That's very nice,\
      \ but it becomes pretty frustrating once it stops working – which, for me, happened\
      \ basically whenever I started the IDE for the second time after installing\
      \ it: Whenever I wanted to run my program, I got an error dialog telling me\
      \ one of the following things:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>Cannot\

      </blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>There is no device installed.\
      \ Please go to Configure Platform Manager to add a device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
      <p>Obviously there were still the same devices as the last time, and I certainly\
      \ hadn't changed configurations since last successfully running the program\
      \ in the emulator. So, almost each time I wanted to work on my project, I had\
      \ to uninstall the entire IDE and reinstall all of it – two installers, one\
      \ of them badly made, and a service pack; half an hour work just to get the\
      \ IDE to work again. Needless to say, I didn't do that very often.</p>\n<p>Of\
      \ course, I googled for a solution. Nothing to find except for two postings\
      \ from people with the same problem without any replies to them. At least I\
      \ wasn't alone; little consolation there, though.</p>\n<p>Today, I got that\
      \ second error message from above for the first time, and that was my luck.\
      \ Googling for <i>that</i> finally led me to a newsgroup message with the solution:\
      \ If you disable the WCE Configuration toolbar, the (unlabeled) \"default device\"\
      \ drop-down box (the rightmost one) <b>will automatically revert to \"Smartphone\

      \ works again. There's no menu command for that option.</p>\n<p>\"Son of a gun!\"\
      , to say it in the original newsgroup poster's words. What an unnecessary annoyance.</p>\n\

      \ yet, but it sounds like it could be related somehow to the problem of not\
      \ being able to replicate -just- a struct, without some other var?</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ That seems to be a general problem of struct replication, not only structs\
      \ as array elements. The code <code>Elements[iElement] = Elements[iElement]</code>\
      \ seems to be enough to cause replication though, whether anything actually\
      \ changed or not.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Yes, I also realized that the detour\
      \ over a temporary local variable probably wasn't necessary at all – I was still\
      \ under the influence of the <code>SwapElements</code> function which actually\
      \ <i>needed</i> one. I've occasionally replicated (individual instances of)\
      \ structs without problems, though – you only have to be aware that changing\
      \ any struct element will cause the entire struct to be replicated. (Actually,\
      \ I've used that as a feature occasionally.)</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ part of Jailbreak's player movement extrapolation code which is designed to\
      \ provide a smooth client-side representation of a player's position with as\
      \ little network traffic as possible. The extrapolated player position is used\
      \ by the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://mychaeel.no-ip.com/jailbreak/JBPanorama\"\
      >scoreboard minimap</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"\
      http://mychaeel.no-ip.com/jailbreak/JBScreen\">JBScreen</a>.</p>\n<p>Well, what\
      \ the <i>heck</i> was I thinking?</p>\n<p>Obviously, instead of using a local\
      \ vector variable, I could have used a simple float; the function calculates\
      \ each component of the local vector, immediately uses it, and then never uses\
      \ it again. Plus, looking more closely at what's actually done there, it looks\
      \ as if I could simply have used the original vector's components instead of\
      \ (sloppily) translating it into a rotated coordinate system first.</p>\n<p>It\
      \ took me a while to get behind what I had thought several years ago. I should\
      \ comment more.</p>\n<p>Using a local vector instead of a float was halfway\
      \ between being an artifact of the way my mind had gone before arriving at this\
      \ code and being self-documenting code. (Sure enough the latter could have been\
      \ achieved just as well with less bytecode overhead by just adding a comment.)</p>\n\
      <p>Translating the input vector into a coordinate system rotated 45° away from\
      \ the main axes was done to make changes in the signum of the return value less\
      \ common. If there's any directional bias in a player's movement at all, it's\
      \ usually along the main axes, following a hallway a mapper will generally have\
      \ aligned along the coordinate system. Strafing left and right even just a bit\
      \ while moving along one of the coordinate axes (say, the Y axis), would change\
      \ the signum of one of the other coordinate components (the X component) frequently.</p>\n\
      <p>If the axes are rotated 45° about the vertical (Z) axis, chances are better\
      \ that you stay \"left\" or \"right\" of an axis while moving, leaving the signum\
      \ of the return value of this function unchanged. Any change in the signum needs\
      \ to be replicated to all clients (as the signum of the scalar player velocity\
      \ they use to extrapolate the player's position); so this coordinate rotation\
      \ reduces the frequency of updates required to send to the clients.</p>\n<p>Phew.</p>\n\
      <p>I remember experimenting with different replication and extrapolation mechanisms,\
      \ using some of UT2003's more obscure logging parameters to get network traffic\
      \ detail into UT2003.log. This optimization actually <i>did</i> reduce the amount\
      \ of updates sent across the network for this detail. I never got around to\
      \ actually measuring whether it made any relevant difference in the <i>total</i>\
      \ amount of network traffic, though. I suppose this could be just one of the\
      \ cases where I indulged in premature optimization just for the fun of it.</p>\n\

      \nIncidentally I dug out the code I scratched in the first entry on this page\
      \ and used it for a related, but different purpose where it actually fits in.\
      \  (Good thing I never really delete something for good unless I'm ''absolutely''\
      \ sure it won't ever be of any use anymore.)\n\nThe code is part of Jailbreak's\
      \ bot support and is supposed to let bots make an educated guess where an enemy\
      \ player is currently located after the enemy gave his position away by triggering\
      \ a release switch.  Naturally, if there's only a single relase switch, all\
      \ that boils down to a single possible location.  Where it gets interesting\
      \ is if there are ''multiple'' release switches and the bots actually have to\
      \ ''guess'' which one the player triggered.\n\nMy code does that based on the\
      \ last known location of a player (directly after a round starts, or after a\
      \ spawn in freedom after winning an arena match, or after being released from\
      \ jail), the walking distance (using the path network) to all of the release\
      \ switches and the time that passed since the player's location was known last.\
      \  With that and a more or less arbitrarily chosen probability distribution\
      \ for a player's distance from his starting point after a given amount of time\
      \ (something based on half a Gaussian) bots take a random guess weighed by the\
      \ respective probability of the enemy being at any of the possible switches.\n\

      \n==January 24, 2003==\n\n[[Image:Legacy_speechmenuhack-ordermenu.jpeg|left|]]\n\
      \nApparently there ''is'' a way.  The \"Team tactics\" menu item here opens\
      \ a submenu where you can select one of a set of tactics for your team.  (All\
      \ other menu items open a list of players you can order.)\n\nGetting it to display\
      \ your own entries is the easy part, to be sure &ndash; being notified when\
      \ the player selects one of the entries requires some more code insight.  It\
      \ is possible though, and I'm just about to implement it.\n\nIf this works out,\
      \ I'll describe the hack in detail somewhere on the Wiki.\n\n==January 25, 2003==\n\
      \n[[Image:Legacy_speechmenuhack-tacticsmenu.jpeg|right|]]\n\nIt works.  When\
      \ you select one of the entries in the tactics menu displayed to the right,\
      \ SetOrders in [[Legacy:TeamAI|TeamAI]] is notified and gets a chance to intercept\
      \ the selection.  The default implementation of SetOrders puts the following\
      \ message into the log:\n\n  ScriptLog: Team New orders TacticsNormal JB-IronMan.xPlayer0\n\
      \nTacticsNormal is a label I assigned to that menu item; everything else in\
      \ that message is from Epic's own code.  Any unwanted cosmetic side effects\
      \ can be controlled by overwriting SetOrders with your own code.\n\nThere's\
      \ relatively little code involved in the whole hack:  One piece of code that's\
      \ executed in some actor's client-side Tick (I used Tick in our [[Legacy:HudBTeamDeathMatch|HudBTeamDeathMatch]]\
      \ subclass, but it could be anywhere) that modifies the speech menu's behavior;\
      \ and a piece of code that modifies some properties of [[Legacy:Bot|Bot]]s when\
      \ they're spawned.  And, of course, the code in SetOrders in [[Legacy:TeamAI|TeamAI]]\
      \ that does whatever you want your custom menu item to do.\n\nModifying the\
      \ speech menu that way has its limitations, of course.  There are only very\
      \ few \"slots\" left for custom notifications (exactly nine), and custom submenus\
      \ like my \"Team Tactics\" menu are only possible for menu items in the \"Orders\"\
      \ submenu.  Details to follow.\n\n==February 3, 2003==\n\nSo little time, and\

      \ down and sleeping\" and one for \"engage in jail fight (and stop when the\
      \ opponent opts out)\".  The latter two will probably require custom scripted\
      \ ''actions'' too:  \"start sleeping,\" \"wait and occasionally snore\" and\
      \ \"stand up\"; and whatever is required to make a bot attack an opponent with\

      \ hard way that even custom game types can't simply replace the game's [[Legacy:TeamInfo|TeamInfo]]\
      \ actors by subclassing [[Legacy:XTeamRoster|xTeamRoster]].  One of our bug\
      \ hunters reported that setting up a game with custom bots broke crucial parts\
      \ of the gameplay, and a look into the log revealed that UT2003 didn't use Jailbreak's\
      \ custom TeamInfo subclass as configured in the the game type's DefaultEnemyRosterClass\
      \ variable but instances of [[Legacy:TeamBlueConfigured|TeamBlueConfigured]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:TeamRedConfigured|TeamRedConfigured]] instead.\n\nSo, once more,\
      \ I'm ending up ''attaching'' an actor of mine to a stock UT2003 actor instead\
      \ of replacing the stock actor's class by my own.  Jailbreak did so with several\
      \ other gameplay-relevant classes (not just TeamInfo) before already &ndash;\
      \ PlayerReplicationInfo, for one, instead of introducing a custom PlayerReplicationInfo\
      \ subclass.\n\nIn Unreal Tournament \"attaching\" an actor to another actor\
      \ was more or less limited to the possibility of setting the attached actor's\
      \ owner to the actor it was attached to and then using the ChildActors iterator\
      \ to retrieve the attached actor when requested.  (Or any variant of that, though\
      \ those that come into my mind are all equally inefficient.)\n\nIn UT2003 however\
      \ every actor can have its own inventory by means of the Inventory variable\
      \ which is declared in class [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]].  Traveling an actor's inventory\
      \ chain is fast and efficient compared to using an iterator, so I implemented\
      \ a generic abstract superclass for info actors that are \"attached\" to another\
      \ actor, including code that automatically sets up a linked list of all \"actor\
      \ tag\" actors of the same class and a mechanism that, if so desired, communicates\
      \ registration and unregistration of an \"actor tag\" to all clients even during\
      \ its lifetime.\n\nWell, anyway, the TeamInfo problem was quickly fixed thanks\
      \ to that mechanism.\n\n===Comments===\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Actually the inventory\
      \ chain was available to all actors in Unreal v205 already. (Yes, I really have\
      \ that code here... :D)\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Hmm.  I don't, but I do have the\
      \ Unreal Tournament sources and... behold, you're right.  Oh well.  :-)\n\n\
      ==March 17, 2003==\n\nWhen I was implementing a new feature yesterday I noticed\
      \ that I had to change a remotely related part of the code in order to avoid\
      \ some small lag in a visual effect &ndash; no big deal, but something that\
      \ deserved to be fixed.  So I opened the class responsible for the delay, found\
      \ the place where I had not anticipated the need for some direct connection\
      \ between two pieces of code in my original design, and added it.\n\nThen I\
      \ realized that this was the third or fourth time I had added a bit of code\
      \ at that place to accommodate a new requirement that had popped up since I\
      \ had initially designed that class.  Each time I had addressed a small particular\
      \ problem, each time I had added a bit of code to fix it; and while each of\
      \ those changes were small and simple, the whole code grew more complicated\
      \ and less elegant with every change I applied to it.\n\nTime to scratch that\
      \ part of the code and rethink its design with all old ''and'' new requirements\
      \ in mind.\n\nChanging, fixing and tweaking code a small part at a time inevitably\
      \ leads to bloated, unelegant, bug-prone constructions sooner or later.  That's\
      \ commonly called [http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/f/feature_creep.html\
      \ feature creep] &ndash; and after a time any software suffering from it becomes\
      \ so unmaintainable that adding, testing and debugging a new feature becomes\
      \ almost as much work as rewriting everything from scratch.  It's a developer's\
      \ nightmare.\n\nSo sometimes it really pays off to start redesigning parts of\
      \ a program before feature creep sets in.  The difficult part is to realize\
      \ that before it's too late; and even more so for people not directly involved\
      \ in the development process who can't relate to the idea of elegant, straightforward\
      \ and bug-resistant program design.  Coding for a mod whose development is being\
      \ slowly ground to a halt by somebody in charge adding more and more features\
      \ that were never part of the original design can be a pretty frustrating experience.\n\
      \n==May 4, 2003==\n\nElapsedTime and RemainingTime in [[Legacy:GameReplicationInfo|GameReplicationInfo]]\
      \ aren't replicated all the time in [[Legacy:UT|UT]] and [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]]\
      \ &ndash; that's for saving bandwidth, I suppose, and that must be a good thing.\n\
      \nBad thing is that it doesn't work too well.  The idea is that ElapsedTime\
      \ and RemainingTime are replicated ''once'' when the whole GameReplicationInfo\
      \ actor is initially replicated to the client, and then the client increases\
      \ ElapsedTime and decreases RemainingTime once per second all by itself.  Sounds\
      \ simple enough, but somehow the initial value replication doesn't seem to work\
      \ &ndash; and that's not just in Jailbreak, it's exactly the same in vanilla\
      \ Deathmatch.  Consequently, the time display in the scoreboard is out of sync\
      \ with the actual game time.\n\nThe programmer who thought that up at Digital\
      \ Extremes or Epic must have anticipated some of those problems though, because\
      \ it actually gets a bit more complicated than what I described above.  In addition\
      \ to ElapsedTime and RemainingTime there's a variable called RemainingMinute\
      \ that is replicated every time it is changed.  The Timer event in [[Legacy:DeathMatch|DeathMatch]]\
      \ sets it to the current value of RemainingTime every full minute.  GameReplicationInfo\
      \ in turn picks it up and copies the replicated value of RemainingMinute to\
      \ the client's local RemainingTime, thus re-syncronizing RemainingTime with\
      \ the game's actual time.\n\nSince I'd like Jailbreak's spiffy game time clock\
      \ in the scoreboard to show the right time at ''all'' times though I guess I'll\
      \ have to look for a fix.\n\n'''Update:'''  Two distinct problems there:  Firstly,\
      \ the initially replicated value of RemainingMinute always resets RemainingTime\
      \ to the last full minute on mid-game connect; secondly, there can be an almost\
      \ arbitrary delay for precaching textures and other content between PostNetBeginPlay\
      \ (when the values for ElapsedTime and RemainingTime have just been replicated)\
      \ and the first call of Timer (where they're updated client-side).\n\n==May\
      \ 7, 2003==\n\n...so in Jailbreak the client sends a replicated function call\
      \ to the server which directly responds by sending another replicated function\
      \ call back to the client along with the current server time.  The client calculates\
      \ a time offset between itself and the server; and if it also takes the time\
      \ into account it took the response function to be called on the client after\
      \ the synchronization request had been issued, it's possible to synchronize\
      \ client and server time to a precision of approximately a tenth of a second.\n\
      \nThat happens once a client has finished loading and precaching the game. \
      \ [[Legacy:GameReplicationInfo|GameReplicationInfo]] only replicates the server\
      \ time the match started, and determines ElapsedTime and RemainingTime based\
      \ on the current client time and its offset to the server time.\n\n===Comments===\n\
      \n'''Kuhal:''' I am interested in the replication behaviour you have discovered\
      \ here.  It may lead to an explanation of some behaviour I am getting during\
      \ a pause in a network game.  The client's countdown clock rapidly counts down\
      \ the seconds that have passed while the match was paused.  While I am certain\
      \ the remaining time on the server has indeed been paused, it seems that the\
      \ client thinks it knows better and catches up.  The weird thing is that the\
      \ game ends \"on time\" when the client ramaining time reaches 00:00.  Are there\
      \ any more references to how these attributes work in UT?\n\n==May 22, 2003==\n\
      \n\"All you can eat\" for 5 ? in the uni's cafeteria today.  Burp.\n\nJailbreak's\
      \ [http://www.planetjailbreak.com/misc/jailbreak2003-scores-5.jpg?link scoreboard]\
      \ displays a minimap showing the current locations of your teammates.  In network\
      \ games that means that those positions have to be replicated to all clients.\
      \  That leads to jerky movement of the dots on the minimap because the locations\
      \ are updated only every couple of frames, not every (client-side) frame.\n\n\
      That problem can be somewhat relieved by using the [[Legacy:Pawn|Pawn]]s' actual\
      \ positions when they happen to be present on the respective client; but the\
      \ other player positions still jerk.  Some sort of motion prediction or motion\
      \ interpolation should be built in; and preferably in a way that does not multiply\
      \ the bandwidth requirements of the whole separate location replication business\
      \ &ndash; my bandwidth conscience is striking already without that.  That rules\
      \ out simply replicating the player's velocity along with their position.\n\n\
      Since the minimap is by design mini, the updates usually don't go beyond a movement\
      \ of a couple of pixels each time; and it's more to show the players' rough\
      \ current whereabouts anyway, not their precise locations.  Maybe an algorithm\
      \ that \"learns\" about the frequency of the position updates and interpolates\
      \ between the ''last two'' replicated known points (and beyond if the next update\
      \ isn't received in time) might yield smooth and reasonably accurate results.\n\
      \nUnrelated to that I also wonder whether I should keep up the splines connecting\
      \ the player names to their location dots on the minimap.  I'm starting to think\
      \ that simply attaching a small tag with the player's name and possibly a health\
      \ bar would be nicer.\n\n==May 24, 2003==\n\nThe principle works, but the movement\
      \ is still jerky.  Motion prediction doesn't work well because the time that\
      \ passes between a replicated variable being set on server-side and its new\
      \ value being received client-side varies wildly:  So even when the player is\
      \ moving in a straight line at a constant velocity, the client-side predicted\
      \ location has to be corrected with every update.\n\nNow I'm pursuing a different\
      \ idea &ndash; adding the received location updates to a client-side list and\
      \ trying to have the client interpolate along that list of locations, choosing\
      \ its velocity independently as to keep up with the succession of new locations\
      \ that are added to the list.\n\nWhen the client-side interpolated location\
      \ information reaches the last known location in the list and the player is\
      \ not known to have stopped moving server-side, it extrapolates the player's\
      \ movement using the last known direction and velocity.  That can even be used\
      \ to save bandwidth:  The server only sends another update when it expects the\
      \ client-side extrapolation to have deviated from the player's actual location\
      \ too much.\n\n==May 25, 2003==\n\nTo my mild surprise what I've implemented\
      \ now works much better than I had dared to hope.\n\nThe server sends occasional\
      \ location updates to all clients; and in addition to that, the absolute value\
      \ of the player's movement velocity.  The ''direction'' of the player's movement\
      \ is derived from the succession of location updates; as described in the previous\
      \ entry it's impractical to derive the velocity as well from the location updates\
      \ because time differences can't be relied upon when network replication is\
      \ concerned.\n\nUsing the absolute value of the player's velocity instead of\
      \ the velocity vector itself saves some bandwidth &ndash; two thirds in the\
      \ size of the replicated data item alone (vector consists of three floats, its\
      \ absolute value of only one), and it's also much less likely to change (the\
      \ absolute value remains the same even when the player changes his movement\
      \ direction or strafes).\n\nStill, with every location update there's bound\
      \ to be a small deviation between the client-side extrapolated location and\
      \ the updated absolute location sent by the server.  Client-side, that deviation\
      \ is simply smoothed out on a short time scale &ndash; that way the client-side\
      \ motion simulation never suffers of any jerking motions, only small variations\
      \ in movement speed which are virtually impossible to notice.\n\nWhat I haven't\
      \ implemented yet is the aforementioned optimization of location updates when\
      \ a player keeps moving on a straight line for a while, thus making the client-side\
      \ linear extrapolation sufficiently accurate even for longer periods between\
      \ updates.  No actual player does that in a firefight, of course; but it's not\
      \ all that unlikely to happen in general, especially given that without that\
      \ optimization location updates would be sent with a frequency of about five\
      \ times per second.\n\n'''Update:'''  Reducing the number of location updates\
      \ that way works fine as well.  When moving on a straight line several seconds\
      \ may pass between two location updates while the client-side minimap location\
      \ indicator still accurately shows the moving player's constantly changing location,\
      \ smoothly picking up a later change in the player's movement direction.\n\n\
      ==May 26, 2003==\n\nWould it still be fun if there weren't always more problems\
      \ awaiting a solution?\n\nWhen reading my code again I realized that it wasn't\
      \ at all robust against server-side updates that never reached a particular\
      \ client.  While the mechanism doesn't rely on the time between two received\
      \ updates anymore, it still assumes that the client gets to see every update\
      \ the server sends &ndash; and that may not necessarily be the case.  If the\
      \ client misses one update, the client's idea of the player's movement direction\
      \ will be completely off, especially since the server already sends only the\
      \ minimum amount of updates that can be used to derive the direction.\n\nSo\
      \ I have to make sure that the engine itself takes care that all clients always\
      \ have a consistent set of information &ndash; the engine must know that if\
      \ a client misses one or several updates it is necessary to send the last ''two''\
      \ location updates to that client next time.  The easiest way to achieve that\
      \ is by having two replicated location variables that are alternatingly set\
      \ to the player's most current location &ndash; the other one then contains\
      \ the location one step earlier.\n\nHowever, the problem isn't completely solved\
      \ already by that.  Since those two variables (a two-element array, actually)\
      \ are set alternatingly server-side (so that on each step only one of the values\
      \ changes and has to be replicated), the client has no way to know which of\
      \ the two replicated locations is the most current one &ndash; and so it can\
      \ only derive the axis on which the player is moving, but not whether the player\
      \ is moving \"forward\" or \"backward\" on that axis.  The client needs one\
      \ bit of extra information to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nIt's not as trivial\
      \ as it may sound to derive a consistent notion of \"forward\" or \"backward\"\
      \ for any given non-zero vector.  Simply trying to define \"forward\" and \"\
      backward\" in respect to a certain fixed direction is ambiguous as soon as a\
      \ vector is lying in the plane perpendicular to the chosen direction; so that\
      \ won't work (or rather, it will, but only in ''almost'' all cases, which is\
      \ unfortunately not enough &ndash; Murphy knows).  So, the method I've chosen\
      \ to define \"forward\" and \"backward\" takes the signum of the first vector\
      \ component (X, Y, or Z, in that order) that is not zero &ndash; that's guaranteed\
      \ to be non-zero for any non-zero vector, and the resultant value changes its\
      \ own sign when the vector does.\n\nTo sum it up, the client now has ''two''\
      \ replicated location values without knowing which one is the most current one;\
      \ so it calculates the vector difference between those two and applies the notion\
      \ of \"forward\" or \"backward\" on it (described above), checks it against\
      \ the separately replicated bit of information sent by the server and changes\
      \ the vector's sign if necessary.  And Bob's your uncle.  (See what Terry Pratchett\
      \ does to one's vocabulary?)\n\nBut... wouldn't it have been much easier and\
      \ just as effective if I had simply replicated an extra bit of information telling\
      \ the client which of the two locations is the most current one, instead of\
      \ laboriously introducing weird notions of \"forward\" and \"backward\" vectors?\
      \ &ndash; Easier it would be but not as effective.  That bit would have to be\
      \ changed every single time the server does an update even if the player only\
      \ made a slight correction in his movement direction; the method I've chosen\
      \ only changes that bit when the player's movement direction changes from \"\
      forward\" to \"backward\" (in the special absolute sense described above), so\
      \ it only ''occasionally'' requires a change instead of ''always''.\n\n'''Addendum:'''\
      \  I actually have it implemented by replicating that extra bit of orientation\
      \ information as ''the velocity's signum'' &ndash; in an attempt to save bandwidth\
      \ when both velocity and orientation change at the same time (and it also wouldn't\
      \ take any more bandwidth when the velocity alone changes).  Upon writing about\
      \ it here it suddenly occurred to me that this maybe wasn't all that smart after\
      \ all &ndash; if ''only'' the orientation changes but the velocity doesn't,\
      \ the engine still has to replicate an entire float value even though only a\
      \ single bit changed.  Would it be more efficient to go the straightforward\
      \ way and use a separately replicated bool variable?  I'll keep a close eye\
      \ on which updates actually need to be sent by the server in a real-game situation\
      \ and decide then...\n\n(And that's also why writing in this \"developer journal\"\
      \ is worth the effort even if nobody's actually reading it &ndash; it makes\
      \ me critically review what I've coded.  It's a one-person code audit, so to\
      \ speak.)\n\n==May 30, 2003==\n\nSo, at last, the scoreboard is feature-complete.\
      \  Phew.  I dread writing the log for the CVS commit and getting JDN up to date...\
      \ but the sooner I start, the sooner I'll be finished.\n\nShowing the Jailbreak\
      \ scoreboard has a noticeable impact on framerate at the moment &ndash; I haven't\
      \ been able to spot a certain, single part of the code that's responsible for\
      \ the majority of the framerate hit.  Disabling certain scoreboard elements\
      \ one at the time shows that the clock takes as much performance as the dotted\
      \ splines do, and the code that updates the scoreboard's state with the game's\
      \ live information isn't far behind.  The performance hit seems to be evenly\
      \ spread over most the code.\n\nEspecially something like the clock could benefit\
      \ from some sort of graphics cache &ndash; it changes only once per second,\
      \ but has to be rendered every frame.  If I could draw the clock on a [[Legacy:ScriptedTexture|ScriptedTexture]]\
      \ and then on the screen, and update the ScriptedTexture only once per second,\
      \ that might save several milliseconds per frame... given that I'd manage to\
      \ get alpha transparency to work on a ScriptedTexture; I wouldn't like the clock\
      \ to be displayed on a rectangular black background, not even for performance's\
      \ sake.\n\nMaybe there is a way to use alpha transparency on a ScriptedTexture.\
      \  During my experiments around drawing a map screenshot on a ScriptedTexture\
      \ for the scoreboard minimap I noticed that the ScriptedTexture's DrawPortal\
      \ function did, somehow, alter the ScriptedTexture's alpha plane &ndash; it\
      \ seems that wherever DrawPortal renders a normal solid texture, the ScriptedTexture\
      \ will be completely transparent, but where an alpha-masked texture is drawn\
      \ on the ScriptedTexture by DrawPortal the ScriptedTexture adopts its alpha\
      \ mask there.  It's all pretty strange.\n\nI also remember that in Unreal Tournament\
      \ a ScriptedTexture could have a \"background texture\" that was used to initialize\
      \ the ScriptedTexture canvas every frame.  I haven't found a corresponding property\
      \ in UT2003's ScriptedTexture class, but maybe it's reusing an inherited property\
      \ for that purpose &ndash; FallbackMaterial maybe?  Gotta try that when I'm\
      \ home.\n\n==May 31, 2003==\n\nI've finally decided that the manual implementation\
      \ docs I had put on JDN have outlived their purpose &ndash; they originally\
      \ were the detailed specifications for the code before UT2003 was released,\
      \ but after the classes were actually created there's little point in still\
      \ keeping the specs around and manually up-to-date.\n\nI tried [[Legacy:UnCodeX|UnCodeX]]'s\
      \ HTML export, and while it works fine, it's information overflow.  I think\
      \ people interested in Jailbreak 2003 implementation details do better with\
      \ syntax-highlighted source code alone &ndash; I tried to document it well after\
      \ all.\n\nThe Wiki script running JDN now supports an extra parameter for the\
      \ <tt>&lt;uscript></tt> tag that directly takes the sources from the CVS repository\
      \ and renders them on the page.  It looks pretty neat and saves me lots of time\
      \ keeping the specs consistent with the code.  Maybe I'll later add a DHTML\
      \ feature for \"collapsing\" function bodys to keep only the comment headers\
      \ visible by default.\n\n'''Update:'''  Oh, and FallbackMaterial as a [[ScriptedTexture]]'s\
      \ background texture does not work.  Guess I'm out of luck.\n\n\n==June 4, 2003==\n\
      \nI want to keep players from using their translocator to get out of jail the\
      \ easy way, and I don't want them to be able to telefrag Bonus Pack monsters.\n\
      \nUnreal Tournament had a handy AllowTranslocation query function in [[DeathMatchPlus]]\
      \ for that.  Whenever anybody, player or bot, tried to translocate, this function\
      \ was called and had the opportunity to prevent the translocation attempt.\n\
      \nUnfortunately, there's nothing like that left in UT2003.  The only thing that\
      \ remains is a function in [[SquadAI]] that's queried for whether a bot will\
      \ try to translocate.  The code that prevents players from telefragging teammates\
      \ is buried in the Translocate function in class [[TransRecall]] -- it's basically\
      \ a hard-coded check whether two players' collision cylinders impinge.\n\n\n\
      The only ''possible'' way into this code is via the SameTeamAs function (class\
      \ [[Controller]]) used there that in turn calls IsOnTeam (class [[GameInfo]]).\
      \  The game could pretend that monsters are on the same team as any player trying\
      \ to telefrag them, but SameTeamAs is used by other parts of the game code as\
      \ well, which makes (ab)using it to prevent monster telefrags not straightforward.\n\
      \nAnd it still leaves me with the question how to prevent players from translocating\
      \ out of jail...\n\n'''Update:'''  I've ended up with removing the translocator\
      \ from jailed players' inventories.  It's not all that messy after all.\n\n\
      ===Comments===\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Maybe make an actor or volume that kills\
      \ the translocator beakon when you try to teleport out, killing the person.\n\
      \n'''ZedSquared''' (from a UT classic point of view, dunno if any of this is\
      \ feasable in 2003) Have a spawnnotify that catches transloctargets and modifies\
      \ their velocity to kick them back to the owner (or the middle of jail) if they're\
      \ in the jail zone perhaps ... or maybe subclass translocator, give the modified\
      \ one as default inv, and override the fire function to not work in jail ...\
      \ probably duff ideas, just thinking aloud late at night :)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ I'd rather try not to replace the normal translocator to achieve the effect\
      \ I'm looking for (plus, there's nothing like SpawnNotify in UT2003)... and\
      \ I'd also like not to require mappers to put in special zones or volumes. \
      \ (Right now jails work with any volume or zone a mapper places -- [[match these\
      \ tags|attaching]] them to a JBInfoJail actor makes them part of a jail.) --\
      \ I could simply take a player's translocator away when he enters jail and give\
      \ it back when he leaves jail, but that seems a bit messy.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ I don't see the problem - can't you just disallow translocator use in jail\
      \ like in Jailbreak for UT?\n\n'''Wormbo:''' That's exactly the problem, there\
      \ is no AllowTranslocation function like in UT which allows the gametype to\
      \ prevent translocation or add various other effects like flagdrop etc.\n\n\
      '''Foxpaw:''' Well, in that case why not allow translocation in jail, and just\
      \ have surfaces that make up the jail solid? That way the translocator beacon\
      \ would not be able to be launched out of the prison so a player couldn't escape\
      \ merely by translocating.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' That would be a mapper-based solution,\
      \ but the past (Jailbreak III) has shown that even in jails that were meant\
      \ to be airtight (and must have been in editor terms since there a jail was\
      \ defined by a distinct zone) occasionally had collision \"gaps\" in them that\
      \ allowed players to shoot or, possibly, throw a translocator target outside\
      \ (JB-Raid).  Even if a jail really is airtight it may be possible to place\
      \ the translocator target so that translocating to it will place the player\
      \ outside jail (JB-Antipody).  Besides, some jails are meant to have open windows\
      \ to the outside or escape routes that players should be able to walk, but not\
      \ translocate through.\n\n\n==June 6, 2003==\n\nThe Jailbreak core to-do list\
      \ has become pretty short.  Maybe, maybe, in a few weeks...\n\n\n==June 8, 2003==\n\
      \nBeyondUnreal's forum breakdown will leave Jailbreak's development forums completely\
      \ empty when they're back up.  Most of the hundreds of postings in there I'd\
      \ have liked to keep mainly to keep a history of Jailbreak 2003 development;\
      \ but some of them were ongoing discussions and long-term documentation.\n\n\
      Unrelated to that, early this afternoon my personal computer at home broke down\
      \ as well; that leaves the CVS server and Jailbreak Developer Network offline\
      \ too.  Fortunately the data itself wasn't lost; just my computer won't work.\
      \  If I'm lucky it's only either the power supply or the mainboard.  The bad\
      \ thing is that tomorrow is a holiday here, so I'll need to stick with this\
      \ notebook as a temporary measure till I have a chance to buy replacement parts.\n\
      \n===Comments===\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'll do my best to remember what's been going\
      \ on. [[Jailbreak rescue]]\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' That's a great idea.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\

      \ or me in chat to get access.\n\n\n==June 9, 2003==\n\nAfter finishing some\
      \ Perl coding work (which I'm actually getting paid for) I'll see that my computer\
      \ is restored to working order or that I at least find out which component exactly\
      \ needs to be replaced.\n\n'''Update:'''  The computer boots up with an old\
      \ PCI video card; but as soon as I replace it by a AGP video card (either my\
      \ current GeForce 4400 Ti or an older GeForce 2 MX), I only get either a strange\
      \ creaking sound from the PC speaker or nothing at all.  Only the fans work.\n\
      \nA friend of mine who's professionally dealing quite frequently with broken\
      \ PCs suggests that it might be either the power supply that doesn't manage\
      \ the AGP cards' load anymore, or the mainboard for some reason doesn't like\
      \ AGP cards anymore.  Unfortunately I don't have a spare ATX power supply at\
      \ hand, so I won't be able to test that theory until tomorrow at the earliest.\n\
      \nIn case it's the mainboard I'll at least use the opportunity to upgrade my\
      \ old Athlon 800 MHz to whatever it is you can currently still get in a regular\
      \ computer hardware shop -- apparently it's hard to find anything slower than\
      \ 2.0 GHz nowadays.\n\n\n==June 10, 2003==\n\nMy computer is up and working\
      \ again.  I was surprised that for not more than about 180 ? I got a new processor\
      \ (Athlon XP 2000+) along with a mainboard, silent cooler and memory (512 MB).\
      \  I could even keep my previous 235 W power supply.  By accident the processor\
      \ is currently underclocked to 1.25 GHz (its normal clock rate would be 1.67\
      \ GHz) -- I'm not even sure whether I can be bothered to open the case once\
      \ more and set the jumpers correctly.\n\nSo far the system seems to be stable.\
      \  Time will tell.\n\n\n==June 11, 2003==\n\nBots should simply try to avoid\
      \ being killed when \"evasive\" team tactics are selected.  (Useful when a team\
      \ has a narrow lead shortly before the time limit runs out.)\n\nI got that to\
      \ work reasonably well with relatively little effort, code-wise:  Set the bots'\
      \ aggressiveness to a really low value to ensure they don't feel inclined to\
      \ engage in fights; then overwrite PickRetreatDestination and make it react\
      \ in a suitably cowardly manner if the bot is seeing an enemy.  Right now they\
      \ simply pick the [[NavigationPoint]] among their current MoveTarget's [[ReachSpec]]s\
      \ that's farthest away from the enemy, or the closest one that provides cover.\
      \  Effectively that makes bots run away from an approaching enemy and make turns\
      \ in order to move out of the enemy's firing line.\n\nWhile it's fun (for a\
      \ while) to chase bots around in a test map, I've come across one or two situations\
      \ where bots are effectively stuck and too easy a prey to approaching enemies.\
      \  First I'll have to have bots detect this; then I'll have to have them react\
      \ to it suitably, for instance by either simply choosing another way out or\
      \ by acting like a cornered beast and falling back to normal dogfighting tactics\
      \ until they're either dead or the threat is gone.  (Tomorrow more -- I'm tired.)\n\
      \n\n==June 13, 2003==\n\nI found one reproducible situation in which bots are\
      \ stuck in a tight loop of pathnodes they visit:  A bot sees an enemy, turns\
      \ to flee, runs into cover; arrived there it wonders what to do next and decides\
      \ to go on an inventory hunt, which leads it back into the enemy's sight --\
      \ ad inf.\n\nThe bad thing is that bots (or rather the native function FindBestInventoryPath\
      \ in [[Controller]]) are not smart enough to check whether they even have the\
      \ chance to pick up the inventory when they've reached it -- otherwise they\
      \ wouldn't even try to reach it more than once in a row, and my problem would\
      \ be a non-issue.\n\n\n==June 14, 2003==\n\nA comment in [[Bot]] hints that\
      \ Epic meant to add a function called FindPathAwayFrom at some time -- alas,\
      \ they didn't yet.  That leaves me with either sticking to my simple escaping\
      \ algorithm from above (and its flaws) or creating a path finding function myself,\
      \ in UnrealScript.\n\nI've started giving the latter a try.  The idea is to\
      \ recursively search the path network for [[NavigationPoint]]s that provide\
      \ cover from the enemy, starting at the bot's current MoveTarget.  Some first\
      \ test runs seem to indicate that it works, and it seems to have negligible\
      \ impact on the performance so far.  (The Clock/UnClock mechanism described\
      \ on [[Code Optimization]] proves pretty useful for such profiling.)\n\n'''Update:'''\
      \  If a bot doesn't find cover nearby and realizes that the enemy must have\
      \ seen it (because it isn't looking the other way right now), the bot panics\
      \ and reverts to normal attack mode until the enemy is dead or out of sight.\
      \  I've put all that into CheckSquadObjectives now, and it seems to work pretty\
      \ well testing it with a single masterful bot.\n\n\n== June 16, 2003==\n\nHmm.\
      \  Why on earth does the game rules tab maintain its settings in separate config\
      \ variables instead of taking and storing them in the game type's own configuration?\n\
      \n\n== June 17, 2003==\n\nWhy does filling the mutator list box on the \"Mutators\"\
      \ tab involve two other separate classes?  Why is reading a list of available\
      \ mutators a native function?\n\n=== Comments===\n'''Wormbo:''' I guess it's\
      \ supposed to speed up loading of mutator classes, but it's not really that\
      \ much of a boost compared to the \"old\" GetNextInt(Desc) method because now\
      \ the mutators' code packages have to be loaded in order to find the mutators'\
      \ names, descriptions and groups.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I wonder whether that native\
      \ function (GetMutatorList in [[xUtil]]) does indeed load the mutator name to\
      \ get the mutator name and description -- a comment says it does ''not'' fill\
      \ in the MutClass element of the MutatorRecord structure, which would make little\
      \ sense if the class is loaded anyway.  (Unless GetMutatorList was internally\
      \ \"optimized\" only to look up the class's default properties without loading\
      \ the class; but I'd be a bit sceptical as to the wisdom of ''that'' optimization.\
      \  But maybe it has to do with cheat protection validating all loaded code...?\
      \  Gah.) -- There's an UnrealScript function LoadClasses in [[xMutatorList]]\
      \ that would load the mutator classes, but it doesn't seem to be actually used.\n\
      \n'''Wormbo:''' It's not the only questionable optimization. (Still remember\
      \ \"<code>// FIXME THIS SUCKS</code>\"?) [[GUIController]].GetWeaponList also\
      \ is a native function and it definately loads and returns weapon classes. I\
      \ can't see any real optimization over Unreal's or UT's code here.\n\n\n== June\
      \ 18, 2003==\n\nI'd like to intercept when somebody is clicking on a checkbox\
      \ -- not just the part with the check mark but its label.\n\nIt took a while\
      \ until I figured out that the bAcceptsInput flag must be set to True for any\
      \ of a [[GUIComponent]]'s delegates to be called.  (Mmph.)\n\n\n== June 23,\
      \ 2003==\n\nThe OnDraw delegate is called for custom [[GUIPanel]] subclasses\
      \ but not for direct subclasses of its parent class, [[GUIMultiComponent]].\

      \ the delegate in [[GUIMultiComponent]]'s native Draw implementation?\n\n'''Update:'''\
      \  Is it just me or does setting the TextFont property in [[GUILabel]] (and,\

      \  (Obsoleted by the introduction of [[GUIStyles]] maybe?)  All labels in the\
      \ game seem to have the same font, even those where Epic's own UnrealScript\
      \ code decrees otherwise by setting TextFont.\n\n\n== June 28, 2003==\n\nThis\
      \ one has me baffled (in a [[WebApplication]] subclass):\n\n<uscript>\nfunction\

      \  ResultTemplate = \"should be overwritten by the next statement\";\n  ResultTemplate\

      \ expect ResultTemplate to contain the result of parsing the file something.inc...\
      \ right?  And so it does, but '''appended to the previous value of the variable.'''\
      \  The resultant value of ResultTemplate is something like this:\n\n  should\
      \ be overwritten by the next statementContents of something.inc\n\nIs that an\
      \ engine bug?  Some arcane feature?  How can using LoadParsedUHTM on the right\
      \ side of an assignment change the way the assignment operator works (given\
      \ that the return value of LoadParsedUHTM is a mere string)?\n\nHowever, the\
      \ following workaround solves the problem:\n\n<uscript>\n  ResultTemplate =\
      \ \"\" $ WebResponse.LoadParsedUHTM(\"something.inc\");\n</uscript>\n\nTrying\
      \ to cast the right side to string in an attempt to do the same ironically yields\
      \ a \"No need to cast StrProperty to itself\" compiler error.\n\n==July 3, 2003==\n\
      \nWorking on an HTML parser and formatter in UnrealScript again.  This time\
      \ it'll be standalone and not part of [[Legacy:Screen|Screen]], even though\
      \ I intend to use it for that end as well; and this time it's possible to use\
      \ it on both [[Legacy:ScriptedTexture|ScriptedTexture]]s and a regular [[Legacy:Canvas|Canvas]].\n\
      \nI hope I'll get around to implementing tables and floating images as well\
      \ this time.  The base architecture I'm currently designing and coding takes\
      \ the requirements for those features into account already, so it should be\
      \ straightfoward to even follow W3C's specification of [http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.4.4\
      \ calculating the width of columns] according to the standard.\n\n==July 5,\
      \ 2003==\n\nThe native Split and Divide functions turn out to be extremely handy\
      \ for the kind of text parsing I'm doing at the moment.  (But I still want my\
      \ native regular expression support in UnrealScript... mmph.)\n\n===Comments===\n\
      \n'''El Muerte TDS:''' Nah, regular expression suck for text parsing, they are\
      \ only useful for match (and replace). Using a [[Legacy:Tokenizer|tokenizer]]\
      \ is much better for text parsing. It would be better if the native tokenizer\
      \ was available in uscript.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' I dare say that depends on how\
      \ you'd use regular expressions.  The _nextToken function in your tokenizer\
      \ could be formulated much more efficiently using regular expressions, for instance.\
      \  (Though I agree that the availability of regular expressions might lead some\
      \ people to creating terribly inefficient parsers.)\n\nFor that matter, my prime\
      \ concern about this HTML parser is its performance, so parsing through the\
      \ input stream character by character in UnrealScript is something I'm determined\
      \ to avoid.  (The first version of [[Legacy:Screen|Screen]]'s ScreenSlidePage\
      \ HTML parser did that, and it was slow as hell for anything exceeding ''very''\
      \ few kilobytes of input text.)\n\n==July 6, 2003==\n\nThe HTML parser works\
      \ like a charm since yesterday and nicely dumps the structure of a parsed HTML\
      \ file, though I haven't made any performance evaluations yet; but in any case\
      \ there's even some potential for optimization still (like identifying a tag's\
      \ handler class by something faster than the sequential search I've settled\
      \ for until the rest works, like binary search &ndash; did I mention that native\
      \ hash support would be a great addition to UnrealScript too?).\n\n===Comments===\n\
      \n'''El Muerte TDS:''' There is a type called map, but it's only native atm\
      \ (just like dynamic array used to be).\n\n==July 9, 2003==\n\nAs usual it's\
      \ not the ''normal'' case that makes implementing something a challenge; it's\
      \ the ''pathological'' cases that do.\n\nThe obvious step after implementing\
      \ an HTML parser is creating a formatter for the parsed HTML element tree. \
      \ The old one I made for [[Legacy:Screen|Screen]] (one of my first UnrealScript\
      \ projects altogether) has no concept of tables or floating boxes, but this\
      \ time I'm determined to add support for those and so I have to deal with the\
      \ conceptual odds and ends that come with it.\n\nA floating box is actually\
      \ a pretty straightforward concept:  It's a rectangle that's placed at the left\
      \ or right edge of the containing box starting at the vertical position of the\
      \ text line it's defined in.  That technique is most commonly used to have text\
      \ flow around an image on a website.\n\nNormally, a web designer adds floating\
      \ elements at the very start of a paragraph so the boxes are placed already\
      \ when the formatter starts wrapping lines between them.\n\nThe beginning of\
      \ a paragraph is, however, not the only valid place for floating boxes:  They\
      \ can just as well be defined in the middle of a line, and that's where the\
      \ trouble starts.  As long as the current line is short enough to fit next to\
      \ the box, everything is still fine; just add the floating box and shorten the\
      \ line box accordingly.\n\nBut what if the floating box is too wide to fit next\
      \ to the text line where it's defined in?  The HTML standards document says\
      \ that the box is then to start directly ''below'' the line it is defined in;\
      \ that's simple enough to implement... but subsequent text after the definition\
      \ of the floating box is still to be added to the very same line ''above'' the\
      \ box, and according to Murphy's law somebody is bound to have some item in\
      \ that line after the floating box definition that increases its line height.\
      \  That means, basically, that the absolute position of the floating box may\
      \ not be completely determined at the time it is added.  Consequently, it may\
      \ be necessary to shift the box down ''after'' it has been rendered.\n\n==July\

      \n==July 16, 2003==\n\nTrying to read a binary file in UnrealScript.\n\nThe\
      \ LoadParsedUHTM function in a freshly created [[Legacy:WebResponse|WebResponse]]\
      \ object does well enough for text files, but I ran against a fundamental problem\
      \ of UnrealScript's string data type here:  Obviously it's not as high-level\
      \ as it should be in a language like UnrealScript and doesn't handle embedded\
      \ null bytes (<code>Chr(0)</code>) well.  A null byte terminates a string for\
      \ all UnrealScript-related intents and purposes; so the content of the binary\
      \ file I read is clipped off after a few bytes when the first null byte appears.\n\
      \nThe only solution for that I can currently think of is briefly opening a TCP\
      \ link from the game to itself, serving the binary file using the IncludeBinaryFile\
      \ function in WebResponse and receiving it with a simultaneously spawned [[Legacy:TCPLink|TCPLink]]\
      \ in binary mode.  But that's not only quite cumbersome, there's also a chance\
      \ that some people's personal firewalls might complain about it (even though\
      \ it's nothing but a local intra-process connection)...\n\n===Comments===\n\n\

      \n==April 1, 2004==\n\nShort of a few rather small features and known bugs,\
      \ Jailbreak 2003 is finally feature-complete.  Yay!\n\nThe transition from UT2003\
      \ to UT2004 has put a big item on our to-do list again, though.  Epic has broken\
      \ source code compatibility on several places, and other problems seem to stem\
      \ from binary incompatibility (the <code>Ping</code> variable in [[Legacy:PlayerReplicationInfo|PlayerReplicationInfo]]\
      \ suddenly transmogrified from an int to a byte, which breaks the score display\
      \ in our scoreboard).\n\nIt's strange, yet interesting and somewhat impressive,\
      \ that UT2004 manages to load and run the game anyway.  At the surface, Jailbreak\
      \ 2003 runs well under UT2004 already, even though it ''looks'' like Jailbreak\
      \ 2003, at least HUD-wise.  Of course we're going to make Jailbreak 2004 blend\
      \ in with UT2004 as well as Jailbreak 2003 does with UT2003.\n\nIf possible\
      \ without too much pain I'd very much like to release Jailbreak 200x as a combined\
      \ UT2003/UT2004 release.  The changes are small enough that it would be a shame\
      \ to abandon all UT2003 users who didn't have the chance or the money to upgrade\
      \ to UT2004 yet.\n\nI'm looking into the details of [[Legacy:CVS|CVS]] branching\
      \ right now.  Our \"main line of development\" will become UT2004, but we'll\
      \ keep a UT2003 branch and take care to merge any generic changes into it. \
      \ ...if that works the way I hope it does.\n\n==April 23, 2004==\n\nThe Jailbreak\

      \nI'm practically out of ideas what else could be added to Jailbreak &ndash;\
      \ almost time to release now...\n\nLast thing we implemented were custom loading\
      \ screens &ndash; it's actually pretty straightforward to replace the default\
      \ images displayed while a map loads by custom ones at runtime.\n\nWe've even\
      \ managed to create one loading screen per bundled map and have the corresponding\
      \ screen shown when the map loads &ndash; and I've added a means for mappers\
      \ to [http://www.planetjailbreak.com/jdn/Loading_Screen embed a custom loading\
      \ screens into their map] which is displayed when that map loads.  Given that\
      \ the necessary information is all there and is just being ignored by UT2004\

      \ idea how glad I am that we're making a UT2003/UT2004 release of Jailbreak\
      \ &ndash; if only for the reason that on both my desktop computer and my notebook\
      \ with their measly 512 MB of RAM starting UT2004 (or even UT2004 server and\
      \ client at the same time) takes ''ages'' while the system swaps like crazy\
      \ &ndash; and loading UT2003, even server and client, works without any swapping\
      \ at all.  UT2004 is a monster...\n\n===Comments===\n\n'''El Muerte:''' I don't\
      \ have any swap issues when running UT2004 on my laptop (512MB ram). Haven't\

      \ we'll win something.\n\n==May 29, 2004==\n\nThere's a known issue in UT2004\
      \ which prevents anybody who ever selected a third-party gametype in the server\
      \ browser from joining any other game of a different gametype.\n\nThis happens\
      \ since, when a gametype is selected, its [[Legacy:GameInfo|GameInfo]] class\
      \ is loaded and its static FillPlayInfo function is called.  After adding its\
      \ settings to the [[Legacy:PlayInfo|PlayInfo]] object, the GameInfo class remains\
      \ loaded in memory (probably because it's somehow still referenced by the PlayInfo\
      \ object and thus cannot be garbage-collected), and when the player tries joining\
      \ a server running a different gametype, that'll fail because the third-party\
      \ gametype's package is still loaded.\n\nI haven't been able yet to find out\
      \ ''why'' exactly FillPlayInfo is called at this point by the server browser\
      \ and which part of the code does anything with the data saved in the PlayInfo\
      \ object referenced by the <code>FilterInfo</code> variable.  However, simply\
      \ avoiding to actually add anything to the PlayInfo object seems to solve the\
      \ problem without any noticable side effect, so the following chunk of code\
      \ makes everything work as it should:\n\n<uscript>\nstatic function FillPlayInfo(PlayInfo\
      \ PlayInfo)\n{\n  local UT2K4ServerBrowser UT2K4ServerBrowser;\n\n  // check\
      \ whether we are called from a server browser\n  foreach Default.Class.AllObjects(Class'UT2K4ServerBrowser',\
      \ UT2K4ServerBrowser)\n    if (UT2K4ServerBrowser.FilterInfo == PlayInfo)\n\
      \      return;  // ignore because called from server browser\n\n  // now do\
      \ the usual stuff\n  Super.FillPlayInfo(PlayInfo);\n\n  PlayInfo.AddSetting(Default.GameGroup,\
      \ ...);\n  PlayInfo.AddSetting(Default.GameGroup, ...);\n}\n</uscript>\n\n==May\
      \ 31, 2004==\n\nWhile fixing some netcode I found out that in one of my classes\
      \ a certain variable was constantly, over and over again, replicated to all\
      \ clients &ndash; several times per second; that class had <code>bNetNotify</code>\
      \ activated, and PostNetReceive was called every other tick.\n\nWhat baffled\
      \ me was that this variable wasn't even changed server-side; nor did it change\
      \ on client side.\n\nIt took me a while to find out what was happening:  This\
      \ variable which was replicated over and over again was a [[Legacy:Pawn|Pawn]]\
      \ reference.  As soon as the Pawn it pointed to was destroyed, the variable\
      \ was duly set to <code>None</code> on both server and client &ndash; but the\
      \ server kept replicating its value to the clients.  And at the end of the day,\
      \ the follwing slightly weird piece of code fixed it all:\n\n<uscript>\n// fixes\
      \ replicating over and over when referenced actor has been destroyed\nif (PawnObjectiveGuessed\
      \ == None)\n  PawnObjectiveGuessed = None;\n</uscript>\n\nThe Unreal engine\
      \ is full of mysteries...\n\n===Comments===\n\n'''Mysterial:''' That works because\
      \ UnrealScript returns <code>None</code> when accessing a property pointing\
      \ to an [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]] with bDeleteMe == true. Internally, the [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]]\

      \ is truly deleted. It getting continually replicated might be a bug in the\
      \ engine. Can you try to create a small reproduction case and send it to me?\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Will do.  :-)\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Hrmph... making a simple\
      \ test case is not as straightforward as I thought.  Then again, if it was an\
      \ obvious bug, it probably wouldn't be in there...  ;-)\n\n==May 31, 2004==\n\
      \nArgh!  People report server crashes, and every single crash log has the following\
      \ lines at its end:\n\n<pre>\n  Critical: UObject::ProcessEvent\n  Critical:\
      \ (JBCameraArena JB-Heights.JBCameraArena, Function Jailbreak.JBCameraArena.Tick)\n\
      \  Critical: AActor::Tick\n  Critical: TickAllActors\n  Critical: ULevel::Tick\n\
      \  Critical: (NetMode=1)\n  Critical: TickLevel\n  Critical: UGameEngine::Tick\n\
      \  Critical: Level Abandoned Heights\n  Critical: UpdateWorld\n  Critical: UServerCommandlet::Main\n\
      \  Exit: Executing UObject::StaticShutdownAfterError\n  Exit: Exiting.</pre>\n\
      \nThat Tick event in question doesn't do anything special that I'd be aware\
      \ of &ndash; it certainly doesn't destroy the actor or anything like that. \
      \ And I cannot reproduce it at all in a local client/server testing environment,\
      \ and it only happens infrequently on other servers anyway.\n\nThere may be\
      \ one thing:  The Tick event calls a function within an [[Legacy:Editinline|editinline]]\
      \ object (which was created along with the JBCamera actor as a [[Legacy:Subobject|subobject]]).\
      \  Perhaps, when JBCameraArena.Destroy() is called, that subobject reference\
      \ somehow becomes invalid and crash-prone under certain circumstances?\n\n:\
      \ '''Update:'''  I just found out that all my JBCameraArena actors '''share\
      \ the same subobject''' &ndash; unlike what I expected, seeing that spawning\
      \ [[Legacy:Emitter|Emitter]] subclasses creates ''distinct'' instances of their\
      \ [[Legacy:ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitter]] subobjects.  While I'm not sure\
      \ whether that's responsible for the crashes, it's definitely not what I had\
      \ in mind and it's a bug when more than one JBCameraArena is active at the same\
      \ time.\n\nTo make it worse, those error messages don't really indicate what\
      \ ''kind'' of error happened (the lines preceding them are different and nothing\
      \ out of the usual in every case &ndash; such as players joining or leaving;\
      \ unfortunately I have no indication whether there's a temporal relationship\
      \ between the events logged before the error and the error, but I believe there's\
      \ not).\n\nIs there anyone out there with Unreal-engine insight who might be\
      \ able to tell me which kinds of errors would trigger those server log messages?\n\
      \n==June 2, 2004==\n\nPhew.  The Jailbreak server crashes are '''fixed''' (and\
      \ stress-tested successfully on MyUnreal's ever-full server), and so are the\
      \ \"web admin does not come up again after level change\" and \"server does\
      \ not react to UDP requests after a while\" bugs.  Those were the toughest ones\
      \ to crack, mostly because I was fixing in the dark; the others were, while\
      \ partly annoying, peanuts.\n\nIn retrospect it seems that the latter two bugs\
      \ stemmed from the engine not fully cleaning up the previous level; and that,\
      \ in turn, was apparently due to my storing some actor references in the ''class\
      \ default'' values of a class &ndash; I did that only to compare the stored\
      \ references to given ones for caching a function's return value over subsequent\
      \ calls.  Even if the actors were destroyed between two calls, I'd expect a\
      \ comparison simply to fail.\n\nAfter I worked around that problem (by storing\
      \ the actors' locations in the cache &ndash; in this case that worked just as\
      \ well), suddenly those both bugs (web server not coming up again, UdpGameSpyQuery\
      \ failing to bind its port after a while) were gone all by themselves.  So,\
      \ note for the future:  '''Never store actor references in default properties!'''\n\
      \n===Comments===\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' That's interesting. I've stored actor references\
      \ in default properties lots. (For instance, any actor can get a reference to\
      \ the level's backdrop in my case by accessing class'Base.Backdrop'.default.Reference.\
      \ Perhaps this behaviour is limited to certain classes?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Perhaps,\
      \ but I don't think so.  The effect of doing that is hardly noticable in local\
      \ testing conditions, in any case (otherwise I'd have seen it a lot earlier)\
      \ &ndash; as I wrote, the most noticable effect was that the web admin [[Legacy:WebServer|WebServer]]\
      \ didn't get cleaned up on level change and that &ndash; after many level changes\
      \ &ndash; a server just didn't respond to UDP requests anymore.  Otherwise,\
      \ everything worked great.\n\n'''Mysterial:''' Since classes are non-Actor objects,\
      \ the usual issues with storing [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]] references in them apply.\
      \ I'm somewhat surprised it didn't crash. Perhaps because the engine doesn't\
      \ actually destroy the class objects as it would most other objects you'd store\
      \ references in, since you're playing another Jailbreak game so it wouldn't\
      \ ever unload the resources.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Frankly, I wasn't ever aware\
      \ of \"the usual issues\" with storing Actor references in non-Actor objects\
      \ &ndash; Jailbreak code still does that on several occasions ([[Legacy:LevelInfo|LevelInfo]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:TeamInfo|TeamInfo]] references in the non-Actor objects which\
      \ represent the small player icons on the HUD, and in at least one other place\
      \ too).  Are you saying that referencing an Actor from a non-Actor object is\
      \ always crash-prone and not supported by the engine?\n\n'''Mysterial:''' [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]]\
      \ references in non-Actor subclasses don't get automatically cleaned up by the\
      \ engine, so they work just like C++ pointers in that accessing them after they've\
      \ been deleted has horrible, unpredictable effects (generally crashing). Additionally,\
      \ since part of garbage collection is traversing every object reference property\
      \ that exists, you need to clean up any such references before a level change\
      \ or you'll either get frequent serialization crashes or prevent the previous\
      \ level from unloading, creating huge memory leaks, as you unfortunately found\
      \ out.\n\n==June 8, 2004==\n\nWith the stress of releasing Jailbreak over, I'm\
      \ free to look into some of my old mutator ideas again.  One of them is '''SprayPaint'''\
      \ &ndash; a simple idea actually, borrowed from Half Life where the ability\
      \ to spray-paint your clan logo on walls was built-in functionality.  I want\
      \ to port that idea to UT2004.\n\nThis would be pretty straight-forward and\
      \ quite uninteresting if I hadn't put it into my mind that it should be possible\
      \ to customize the spray-painted images by simply dropping a BMP file (1-bit,\
      \ 64x64 pixels) into a directory; and, if that's done by a client in a network\
      \ game, all other clients should be able to see the same image too.  The latter\
      \ is just some replication acrobatics; the former is where I saw my challenge.\n\
      \nReading arbitrary files in UnrealScript isn't really supported, but if you\
      \ need to do it for text files, instantiating a [[Legacy:WebResponse|WebResponse]]\
      \ object and using its LoadParsedUHTM function works quite well.  However, UnrealScript\
      \ strings aren't binary safe &ndash; null bytes act as end-of-string tokens\
      \ and thus cannot be included in a string.  Attempting to load a binary file\
      \ such as a BMP image with LoadParsedUHTM results in a byte string truncated\
      \ at the first null byte.\n\nI've worked around that problem now by spawning\
      \ a local [[Legacy:WebServer|WebServer]] listening on a random free port, delivering\
      \ files as \"application/octet-stream\" with WebResponse's function IncludeBinaryFile,\
      \ and a [[Legacy:TcpLink|TcpLink]] operating in MODE_Binary to receive the binary\
      \ data from the local web server.  In theory this setup is able to read the\
      \ contents of any binary file within the UT2004 directory hierarchy into an\
      \ UnrealScript byte array, and it's working great for my purposes.\n\n===Comments===\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:''' Can you see outside of the UT2004 directory structure with\
      \ that technique?  Cunning solution btw\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Frighteningly enough,\
      \ I can read ''any'' file that way.  (I had actually &ndash; and perhaps naively\
      \ &ndash; assumed that the IncludePath in WebResponse would not allow UnrealScript\

      \ best to let Epic know about this and to remove this last \"Developer Journal\"\

      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Without having a way to generically get full directory listings,\

      \n==September 5, 2004==\n\nPicking up my old SprayPaint mutator idea again.\
      \  To reiterate, it's about being able to spray logos on walls &ndash; the logos\
      \ must be provided as monochrome bitmaps (i.e. bitmaps with 1-bit color depth)\
      \ in a certain UT2004 subdirectory, and you can spray them on walls in a color\
      \ of your choice; and the best thing is that other players on the server would\
      \ see the exact same thing even though they don't have the source bitmap on\
      \ their system.  On the long run I even want the sprayed images to persist across\
      \ matches.\n\nThere's a bit of replication acrobatics involved in making that\
      \ work, but so far it works nicely &ndash; the data is loaded client-side, transmitted\
      \ to the server via a replicated function in \"bunches\" of no more than 64\
      \ bytes a tick, and then left to the engine to be replicated back to all (non-bNetOwner)\
      \ clients.\n\nTwo things I noticed doing that were that, firstly, the engine\
      \ only replicates the first 256 bytes of an array of 512 byte values (where\
      \ I don't know exactly whether it's the number of elements or their total size\
      \ which is limited by the engine); and secondly, that passing a byte array via\
      \ a replicated function call will only actually replicate the first value of\
      \ that array, not the entire array.  However, if the array is part of a struct\
      \ which is passed through the replicated function, everything works fine (hence\
      \ my \"bunches\" of data).\n\nThe user interface for that thing is keeping me\
      \ thinking.  Right now I figure that pressing your usual \"talk\" key (\"T\"\
      , for instance) quickly twice in a row (like a double-click) would pop up a\
      \ window where you could select which image to spray (using the mouse or arrow/movement\
      \ keys), but that idea is subject to change.  For now, the \"mutate SprayImage\
      \ <filename> <color>\" console command does the trick.\n\n==November 17, 2004==\n\
      \nI've moved into my new apartment last Sunday, and today I got ISDN and DSL\
      \ activated.  Thus, JDN is up again &ndash; whatever caused my computer to break\
      \ down two weeks ago is mysterious to me.  Maybe my video card overheated after\
      \ all after having been running non-stop for months without a monitor attached\
      \ to it... still, not really a satisfactory explanation.\n\nNow that my home\
      \ computer has been hosting CVS, an Apache webserver with JDN and other services\
      \ and an ISDN calling machine and fax server for quite a while and across several\
      \ hardware updates, I've been thinking &ndash; it's getting harder and harder\
      \ to keep the noise level coming from this machine at a level I'm willing to\
      \ bear in my living room.  Plus, most of the time the computer is merely converting\
      \ electric power into noise and heat via a video card and processor which are\
      \ ridiculously overpowered for something acting as a web/fax/CVS server most\
      \ of the time.\n\n...so &ndash; *drumroll* &ndash; I've got that fabulous idea\
      \ of building a small machine out of spare parts mostly left over from hardware\
      \ upgrades of my main PC over the years.  I've got two mainboards/processors\
      \ to choose from (a Pentium 200 MHz and an Athlon 800 MHz which I could underclock\
      \ to 500 MHz), some left-over RAM, an ethernet card (my latest mainboard had\
      \ that on-board) and a simple video card (an ATI XPert@Work sporting a 3D chipset\
      \ with the staggering amount of 8 MB VRAM).  I also have a midi-tower computer\
      \ case somewhere.  What I need is a silent power supply and &ndash; probably\
      \ &ndash; a new harddisk (especially if this thing is to act as a file server\
      \ as well) unless I find a suitable one in my pile of used hardware.\n\nI figure\
      \ I'll install Debian Linux on it &ndash; with that awesome 3 MBit/s downstream\
      \ I've got I can even download it without much hassle.\n\n'''Update:'''  Wow.\
      \  Silent 80 GB harddisks come for less than 60 EUR these days?  o_O\n\n==March\

      \ Tournament?  Probably not, because I never actually released it, and the BuF\
      \ mess-up two years ago ate all remaining evidence for it.\n\nBasically, it\
      \ allowed the user to see stereo 3D by displaying two versions of the current\

      \ to see the effect, just like for [http://www.brossco.fi/janne/eclipse99/budapest/bu_3d.html\
      \ these photos].\n\nI tried to implement the same thing for UT2004 on Sunday.\
      \  To the degree that two viewports were rendered on the screen next to each\
      \ other, it was a piece of cake; but, having the HUD render within one of those\
      \ viewports prove to be impossible.  In Unreal Tournament, it was basically\
      \ just a matter of setting [[Legacy:Canvas|Canvas]].OrgX/OrgY and ClipX/ClipY\
      \ right &ndash; but UT2004's HUD makes heavy use of the native DrawSpriteWidget\
      \ function which, while honoring OrgX/OrgY and ClipX/ClipY, doesn't take the\
      \ reduced size of a viewport defined through those properties into account when\
      \ positioning and scaling the widgets.\n\nSo, no way.  Well, it was just an\
      \ experiment anyway.  The 3D effect itself is pretty cool, though, even if it\
      \ strains the eyes to squint that way for an extended period of time...\n\n\

      \ followed [http://www.planetjailbreak.com/?news=275 PlanetJailbreak news] are\
      \ aware of what I've been working on recently: the visuals of freezing and shattering\
      \ a player model.  Part of the problem is to overlay the player model and the\
      \ weapon it holds with an \"ice\" texture that gradually fades in.\n\nMy first\
      \ idea was creating a [[Legacy:Shader|Shader]], setting its <code>Diffuse</code>\
      \ material to the player's skin texture, the <code>Specular</code> material\
      \ to my alpha-blended \"ice\" texture and use a [[Legacy:ConstantColor|ConstantColor]]\
      \ as its <code>SpecularityMask</code> material to control the fading.  That\
      \ works fine for the player model, but utterly fails for the weapon &ndash;\
      \ the weapon's textures are implicitly defined through the mesh, and there's\
      \ no way UnrealScript code can get hold of them (not even anything similar to\
      \ [[Legacy:Dynamicly Accessing Original Static Mesh Textures|this method]]).\n\
      \nSo, that approach fell somewhat short of what I had envisioned.\n\nBut there's\
      \ <code>OverlayMaterial</code> defined in [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]], along with\
      \ a <code>SetOverlayMaterial</code> method, which is used (among others) by\
      \ the UDamage to produce that \"energy\" overlay effect on players and weapons.\
      \  I had previously found out already that using a plain texture as <code>OverlayMaterial</code>\
      \ will simply replace the model's skin by that texture (instead of overlaying\
      \ it) &ndash; not what I intended, so I had put that approach aside.  Now, I\
      \ picked it up again.\n\nAfter some lucky experimentation, I found that I was\
      \ able to use a [[Legacy:Shader|Shader]] as an <code>OverlayMaterial</code>\
      \ whose <code>Specular</code> material was set to my \"ice\" texture.  Funnily,\
      \ I noted that:\n\n* The <code>Diffuse</code> material I tried to set was automatically\
      \ overwritten with a reference to the overlaid actor's skin (the skin part with\
      \ the highest ordinal number in the meshmap, I guess).  So, here's a way to\
      \ find the original skins of a non-static mesh if you need to.\n\n* The <code>A</code>\
      \ (alpha) member of the <code>Color</code> property of a [[Legacy:ConstantColor|ConstantColor]]\
      \ material I tried to use as the shader's <code>SpecularityMask</code> was immediately\
      \ reset to zero whenever I attempted to set it to something different.  Why\
      \ would the engine do such a thing...?\n\nSo, that didn't work the way I had\
      \ it intended to.  Neither did any attempts to replace the plain \"ice\" texture\
      \ in the <code>Specular</code> slot by a [[Legacy:Modifier|Modifier]] of any\
      \ kind.\n\nThen, in a last futile attempt, I tried using a [[Legacy:FadeColor|FadeColor]]\
      \ in the <code>SpecularityMask</code> slot (instead of a [[Legacy:ConstantColor|ConstantColor]]\
      \ as before), and lo!, when I set its <code>FadePeriod</code> to something other\
      \ than the default, zero, it worked!  Well, of course I had a pulsing overlay\
      \ now, but setting both <code>Color1</code> and <code>Color2</code> to the same\
      \ color fixed that.\n\nSo, now I've got a texture overlay on both player and\
      \ weapon which I can smoothly fade in (and out, if there was any need) and which\
      \ still lets the original textures shine through.\n\n===Comments===\n\n'''Wormbo:'''\
      \ Interesting hack. :) The engine uses the ConstantColor in the SpecularityMask\
      \ slot to fade out the overlay effect when the actor's overlay timer drops below\
      \ 1 or so.\n\n==May 1, 2005==\n\nMicrosoft has a pretty good reputation on IDEs,\

      \ enough to cause replication though, whether anything actually changed or not.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Yes, I also realized that the detour over a temporary local\
      \ variable probably wasn't necessary at all &ndash; I was still under the influence\
      \ of the <code>SwapElements</code> function which actually ''needed'' one. \
      \ I've occasionally replicated (individual instances of) structs without problems,\
      \ though &ndash; you only have to be aware that changing any struct element\
      \ will cause the entire struct to be replicated.  (Actually, I've used that\
      \ as a feature occasionally.)\n\n==July 15, 2006==\n\nI found the following\
      \ function in [http://mychaeel.no-ip.com/source/Jailbreak/Jailbreak/Classes/JBTagPlayer.uc?rev=1.58&view=auto\
      \ some source code] I had written years ago:\n\n<uscript>\n// ============================================================================\n\
      // CalcOrientation\n//\n// Calculates and returns an artificial value representing\
      \ the orientation of\n// a vector. The returned value has the following properties:\n\
      //\n//   * Non-zero for any non-zero vector. Zero for the zero vector.\n// \
      \  * Negating the argument yields the negative result.\n//\n// Those properties\
      \ allow to use this function to make any difference between\n// two given points\
      \ in space unambiguous by passing a single additional binary\n// bit of information.\n\
      // ============================================================================\n\
      \nsimulated function float CalcOrientation(vector VectorInput)\n{\n  local vector\
      \ VectorTranslated;\n\n  VectorTranslated.X = VectorInput dot vect(1, 1, 0);\
      \  if (VectorTranslated.X != 0.0) return VectorTranslated.X;\n  VectorTranslated.Y\
      \ = VectorInput dot vect(1,-1, 0);  if (VectorTranslated.Y != 0.0) return VectorTranslated.Y;\n\
      \  VectorTranslated.Z = VectorInput dot vect(0, 0, 1);  if (VectorTranslated.Z\
      \ != 0.0) return VectorTranslated.Z;\n\n  return 0.0;\n}\n</uscript>\n\nIt's\
      \ part of Jailbreak's player movement extrapolation code which is designed to\
      \ provide a smooth client-side representation of a player's position with as\
      \ little network traffic as possible.  The extrapolated player position is used\
      \ by the [http://mychaeel.no-ip.com/jailbreak/JBPanorama scoreboard minimap]\
      \ and [http://mychaeel.no-ip.com/jailbreak/JBScreen JBScreen].\n\nWell, what\
      \ the ''heck'' was I thinking?\n\nObviously, instead of using a local vector\
      \ variable, I could have used a simple float; the function calculates each component\
      \ of the local vector, immediately uses it, and then never uses it again.  Plus,\
      \ looking more closely at what's actually done there, it looks as if I could\
      \ simply have used the original vector's components instead of (sloppily) translating\
      \ it into a rotated coordinate system first.\n\nIt took me a while to get behind\
      \ what I had thought several years ago.  I should comment more.\n\nUsing a local\
      \ vector instead of a float was halfway between being an artifact of the way\
      \ my mind had gone before arriving at this code and being self-documenting code.\
      \  (Sure enough the latter could have been achieved just as well with less bytecode\
      \ overhead by just adding a comment.)\n\nTranslating the input vector into a\
      \ coordinate system rotated 45° away from the main axes was done to make changes\
      \ in the signum of the return value less common.  If there's any directional\
      \ bias in a player's movement at all, it's usually along the main axes, following\
      \ a hallway a mapper will generally have aligned along the coordinate system.\
      \  Strafing left and right even just a bit while moving along one of the coordinate\
      \ axes (say, the Y axis), would change the signum of one of the other coordinate\
      \ components (the X component) frequently.\n\nIf the axes are rotated 45° about\
      \ the vertical (Z) axis, chances are better that you stay \"left\" or \"right\"\
      \ of an axis while moving, leaving the signum of the return value of this function\
      \ unchanged.  Any change in the signum needs to be replicated to all clients\
      \ (as the signum of the scalar player velocity they use to extrapolate the player's\
      \ position); so this coordinate rotation reduces the frequency of updates required\
      \ to send to the clients.\n\nPhew.\n\nI remember experimenting with different\
      \ replication and extrapolation mechanisms, using some of UT2003's more obscure\
      \ logging parameters to get network traffic detail into UT2003.log.  This optimization\
      \ actually ''did'' reduce the amount of updates sent across the network for\
      \ this detail.  I never got around to actually measuring whether it made any\
      \ relevant difference in the ''total'' amount of network traffic, though.  I\
      \ suppose this could be just one of the cases where I indulged in premature\
      \ optimization just for the fun of it.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Journal|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
