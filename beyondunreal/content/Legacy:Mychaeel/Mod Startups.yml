      \ don't make a mod; you need skilled people for that. Of course everybody who\
      \ calls for a mod team realizes that. Only few people realize what such a call\
      \ takes to be attractive though. Ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Why should\
      \ anybody be interested in joining your team?</b> Don't presume that anybody\
      \ will be awestruck by your idea. Everybody is an idea man; rarely a mod fails\
      \ because the people making it ran out of ideas. Good coders, mappers, modellers,\
      \ animators, skinners wouldn't be that way if they hadn't a whole bunch of ideas\
      \ of their own. Especially if your idea just marginally improves on an existing\
      \ idea (like the n-th Counter Strike clone, or what appears as one to the casual\
      \ reader), it's hard to communicate the point of your venture to the people\
      \ who might be able to realize it. Besides, people that are good at their respective\
      \ trade are notoriously busy with either their own projects or other team projects\
      \ they're in.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>What do you add to the project yourself?</b>\
      \ Why would anybody want to sacrifice their independence to work with you? If\
      \ it's just your mod idea, it'd better be a damn good one. Wanting to make a\
      \ website and PR work won't do. I'm by no means underestimating the value of\
      \ an attractive website and great PR work, but on the priority list of things\
      \ crucial to creating a good mod those items are still ranking below technical\
      \ skills like modelling, skinning, coding and mapping. On the other hand, if\
      \ you sort that list by how easy it is to find someone who fills those positions,\
      \ it's exactly upside-down: If you <i>have</i> a mod, it's not a big deal to\
      \ do the PR work and a website for it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Isn't there\
      \ already another team that does the same?</b> Certainly not <i>exactly</i>\
      \ the same, but close enough. Be realistic: You'll have a better chance to end\
      \ up with a finished thing to be proud of if you're working together with other\
      \ people rather than splitting the (usually small) community that's interested\
      \ in ideas like yours into very small fractions each of which hardly has a chance\
      \ to ever get something with the scope of your (and their) ideas done. You don't\
      \ have to abandon your own ideas by joining another project. If your ideas are\
      \ good (and the team you're joining is good), they'll be open to what you're\
      \ saying, if you do it in nice way. Keep in mind: You won't get any recognition\
      \ at all if you're the leader of a team of one and your mod never goes beyond\
      \ the state of a flashy website.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>What kind of working\
      \ relationship do you offer?</b> People (especially those that know that you\
      \ need their help) are hardly inclined to join a team as a mere subject to a\
      \ leader's every whim. The people you're looking for expect to be treated as\
      \ equals in a team where everybody's opinions are valued. (Besides, a good team\
      \ doesn't need an official \"lead\" position at all.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last,\
      \ but by no means least: <b>Respect the rules of the community you're approaching.</b>\
      \ Yeah, it's obvious, but experience tells that it's unfortunately not obvious\
      \ to everyone. If you're posting in a forum system with many individual forums\
      \ on different topics, don't spam your posting into more than one of those forums.\
      \ All you'll achieve is that people get mad at you before they've even read\
      \ your posting. It's hard to get somebody to help you who's mad at you to start\
      \ with. For that matter (if common courtesy isn't enough reason already), don't\
      \ belittle other people or projects in the process of advertising your mod.</p>\n\

      \ something along the lines of \"I have a great idea, send me a message if you\
      \ want to know more\" is completely ineffective. Forum regulars have seen dozens\
      \ of idea people already, and reading your forum posting is the peak of what\

      \ time, or you'll lose them forever.</p>\n<p>Your concept doesn't need to be\
      \ finished to the last detail, but it should show that you understand the scope\
      \ of what you're venturing. Be realistic, not overly enthusiastic.</p>\n<p>Don't\
      \ waste your time with designing an intricate internal hierarchy of team members;\
      \ I've seen mod concepts where that part took as much room as the technical\
      \ concept of the mod itself. Assign a lead coder or lead mapper when you <i>have</i>\
      \ those people already and find that you need them to efficiently channel your\
      \ team's organization. Many teams work very well without an internal hierarchy.\
      \ In fact, teams frequently work <i>better</i> if everybody feels that they're\
      \ on an equal footing with the rest of the people they work with, and with nobody\
      \ to scratch their ideas and objections with just a shrug and a decree. (Then\
      \ again, that really only works with the right people; but wait until you find\
      \ out what kind of internal organization works best for your team before you\
      \ attempt to design one artificially.)</p>\n<p>You can't <i>decree</i> that\
      \ your mod is going to be quality; stating so in your concept is just a display\
      \ of hubris (don't you think every mod team tries to make a quality mod?). Making\
      \ a quality mod is a lot of work, some of which is far from being outright fun.\

      \ project in forums in a way that will hardly yield any positive result. Any\
      \ thoughts on the content?</p>\n<p><b>Luggage:</b> Interesting read.&#160;:)\
      \ I'm just working on a concept paper myself, so it was really interesting.\
      \ This seems to be aimed at community outsiders though, I think that only applies\
      \ to maybe 20-30% of mod makers. Still it was pretty interesting to me.&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Incidentally, it appears that most people posting a request\
      \ for team members for their new mod <i>are</i> indeed community outsiders.\
      \ In any case, they're mostly <i>modding</i> community outsiders, and many of\
      \ them make the same mistakes: Thinking that the fact alone that they've got\
      \ an idea will spark everybody's interest, and that technically skilled modders\
      \ are just sitting idly and waiting for an opportunity to join somebody with\
      \ a mod idea (but, in too many cases, hardly any mod making skills) because\
      \ they're out of ideas themselves.</p>\n<p><b>Luggage:</b> Hehe, true. With\
      \ the concept I spoke of, I'm now trying to get a playable <i>interesting</i>\
      \ core version done of what will hopefully evolve into a UT2k3 TC. I have the\
      \ whole project in my head and I'm in the process of writing it all up in a\
      \ concept paper, but I'm starting out with the core element of gameplay. The\
      \ other stuff that is planned enhances this further and adds more to the gameplay.\
      \ Damn, this could really work out&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>BesigedB:</b> The unrealed\
      \ goblin is coming to get you</p>\n<p><b>Jb:</b> I agree with your thoughts\
      \ Mychaeel. Its nice to see that the people out there have ideas. Speaking of\
      \ that, with all the new features that engine in UT2003 will support I can see\
      \ a lot more creative ideas coming...How about a Tribe2 UT version that works&#160;:)\
      \ heheh j/k</p>\n<p><b>Will:</b> interesting read, Mychaeel, it seems many people\
      \ who post on forums asking for a mod team should really read this first.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Mych takes (almost) sadistic delight in posting a link to\
      \ this page on such threads. (though if he didn't, I would. And I'd enjoy it\
      \ more... bwahaha!)&#160;;)</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> That's what I wrote it\
      \ for, after all. Much more efficient than ranting anew each and every time.\
      \ &#160;;-) Sadly enough, posting the link frequently doesn't cause people to\
      \ read this text, let alone understand it.</p>\n<p><b>autocol:</b> As someone\
      \ just beginning to take an interest in modifying games (coming from a 3DS animation\
      \ background) I think the best advice for 99% of the people that really need\
      \ to read this is: if you haven't got the skills, don't even bother! The number\
      \ of people that entertain thoughts of being a professional footballer would\
      \ make the mind boggle, but how many make it? As a percentage, close enough\
      \ to zero. I think the number of people who entertain thoughts of creating a\
      \ sweet mod, when compared to the number of people with the talent, vision,\
      \ skills and tenacity to actually create a playable mod, when expressed as a\
      \ percentage, is again, basically zero. I've got an awesome idea for a mod,\
      \ but I think I'll start by creating the SIMPLEST mutator I can think of...\
      \ I think most of the guys that post these \"team requests\" should do the same.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Kuhal:</b> <b>reply to autocol</b> Your analogy is flawed IMO. The fact\
      \ that very few people achieve something is not good grounds for not trying\
      \ in the first place. If everyone stopped trying, then there would never be\
      \ any successes right? And if people without the technical ability don't try...they\
      \ will never get the techincal ability. If you meant people without <i><b>potential</b></i>\
      \ then that's even worse because who can judge someone's potential without having\
      \ spent alot of time with them? 10 years ago it was unheard of for people in\
      \ their own homes to be modelling 3D animations. It was unheard of for coders\
      \ to be writing a few lines of code and effecting such huge changes to a complex\
      \ game like UT. Yet today, we have topics dedicated to helping new entrants\
      \ to the modding community to rationalise their chances of success or failure.\
      \ I think this is great progress. Success of an industry can be measured by\
      \ it's failures as well as it's triumphs. The more people that try, fail and\
      \ try again the better IMO. It all adds to a richer community. I applaud this\
      \ Wiki for attempting to help the majority of would be modders who do not <i>yet</i>\
      \ have the technical ability but want to try. BTW, there is absolutely no ill\
      \ intent in this message. Just my rant on Mych's rant triggerd by your comments&#160;:)\
      \ Cheers</p>\n<p><b>autocol:</b> Fair enough... Strangely, I think we actually\
      \ agree with each other but perhaps I expressed myself poorly. As a relative\
      \ newbie to the idea of modifying games, I've found the Wiki - and various other\
      \ tutorial sites - absolutely invaluable resources in starting to consider creating\
      \ my own game content. Without these resources there's not a snowballs chance\
      \ in hades I would have figured it out. I'm certainly not saying that people\
      \ should just give up and take up knitting, which is perhaps how my original\
      \ comment may have read. What I <b>am</b> saying is that these people that make\
      \ requests should <b>TRY</b> some simple mutators, practise some coding/mapping/skinning/whatever-ing\
      \ BEFORE they make these open requests for loads of experienced coders/mappers/skinners/whatever-ers\
      \ to join their mod and make them the gaming equivalent of Bill Gates. I agree\
      \ that \"the more people that try, fail and try again the better.\" (Myself,\
      \ I'm doing a lot of the \"failing\" at this point&#160;:)) My rant was really\
      \ directed at those people that can't be bothered with the \"try\" part...</p>\n\
      <p><b>Kuhal:</b> Yep we do agree then.</p>\n<p><b>Githianki:</b> Good advice,\
      \ though a tad \"discouraging\" in the intro. I understand the frustration you\
      \ are trying to prevent but since this is mostly a problem with those new to\
      \ the scene, the advice needs to come in a tone less preachy at the start or\
      \ people won't read the (rather lengthy) entire article. I know you probably\
      \ didn't mean it to be preachy but context is going to vary with the reader's\
      \ experience level. Those who are familiar with the mod scene will have patience\
      \ and see the wisdom in the advice you have laid out. On the other hand, those\
      \ new to the scene might say \"He says he isn't talking about me but then he\
      \ says to me 'You are here because I or someone else think I do need to talk\
      \ to you'\". There is a conflicted message to the reader there. If new modders\
      \ are impatient (and needing the advice the most), will they bother to continue\
      \ reading after that intro? Maybe. The article is good but it could be improved\
      \ with regards to its intended audience. Go for greatness! You are quite clearly\
      \ capable of it as evidenced by your words across this wiki. BTW -its Reinhart\

      <p><b>Mosquito:</b> Very nice read Mych, but I think there's a couple things\
      \ you need to add. People need to know how realistic making a mod is and getting\
      \ a team together. It's like finding a job. You have to put previous work on\
      \ your resume to get a better chance of getting the job. You should add in that\
      \ the best way to get team members, is to already have worked on either a REALLY\
      \ nice mod where your work was top notch, or you've done important work for\
      \ 3 or 4 other mods. That way people can not only see that there's proof that\
      \ you're capable, they can also see the quality of your work. Mod developers\
      \ look for competent leaders that can take the brunt of the work. It's important\
      \ that you know how to do more then just 1 thing for the mod, however coders\
      \ seem to get the interest these days. Your right that there is a skill ladder,\
      \ where webpage design is at the bottom and everything else above it. But what\
      \ if your only skill is mapping? or design map textures? Where's the mod going\
      \ to go with those skills? Anyways, that's my comments.</p>\n<p><b>Sordith:</b>\
      \ Nice read. Something every new mod developer/indy game developer should read.\
      \ Another thing you might want to add is an example of a design doc. Some tutorials\
      \ can be found here:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"\

      <p><b>Pendulum:</b> I've read this entire document. I guess you could call me\
      \ one of those outsiders. I'm however not going to try and recruit anyone until\
      \ I absolutely need some help. I'm going to try and do everything I can on my\
      \ own. I'm not worried about getting my mod done in some specified amount of\
      \ time (even though having the chance to win some of the money in the new contest\
      \ would be nice), so I'm going to learn everything I can and do everything I\
      \ possibly can on my own. I believe this is the way for me to get the experience\
      \ I need, learn anything and everything. I'm no artist so that is my weak point,\
      \ but good quality textures and skins aren't the most important thing in my\
      \ opinion, they can wait till closer to the end. I'm sure everyone else has\
      \ different ideas on this.</p>\n<p><b>Swift Viper:</b> That page that Wormbo\
      \ linked to was funny! I don't know what is worse, that page or saying New Mod,\
      \ e-mail me for more information. I hate when people do that and they get upset\
      \ when people ask what the mod is (I'm allow to link to threads in the main\
      \ UT2k3 fourms right?). Those are the kind of mod team I would not join. I'm\
      \ confused about one thing, how much do you need to know (besides Programming)\
      \ before asking for help? I don't want to miss up someday.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ It's not a question of how much you need to know .. it's more a question of\
      \ what you've done already. For example if you've made a really cool looking\
      \ weapon, modelled, animated, and skinned it - and can't code up the weapon\
      \ code yourself - then asking for a coder's help about the time you are animating\
      \ the weapon would be good.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I agree, you don't have to\
      \ know how to program or anything, but you do need to have done enough to demonstrate\
      \ that you don't expect everyone else to do it for you. If, in Entropic's example\
      \ above, you ask a coder to join you right when you start, then he/she/it is\
      \ ready to start testing and your model is not ready, the programmer may become\
      \ frustrated and unmotivated. Likewise, if you are the programmer, and you ask\
      \ someone to model the weapon for you, they may be disappointed when they are\
      \ finished and can't see their model in the game because you aren't finished\
      \ yet.</p>\n<p><b>Swift Viper:</b> So in other words I could program the whole\
      \ weapon and have it working and everything? Is that good enough, so they will\
      \ only have to make the model and import it, then everything is in place? What\
      \ about the maps? As for the model, do I have to make a basic low poly model\
      \ so someone else can get the idea of what it should look like and finish it\
      \ up and skin it? I'm trying to make sure I get it right for when the time comes\
      \ and not mess up and look dumb, but that won't be anytime soon. BTW I might\
      \ become a programmer, so having working code and the ideas done will be enough\
      \ right? Sorry if anything has already been answered or if any questions have\
      \ been repeated, want to make sure I get it right the FIRST time (and reading\
      \ the page a good few times).</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Firstly, don't worry\
      \ about getting the balance right the first few times. People make mistakes\
      \ - the trick is to learn from them. Secondly - all people really want is for\
      \ you to demonstrate some ability in terms of actually doing the work to create\
      \ the mod. It doesn't matter how much (or little) you get done before asking\
      \ for help - the fact that you have done something towards the effort needed\
      \ to create the mod is enough to at least overcome people's initial wariness.</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd>There are plenty of people who come up with a mod idea, throw a web-site\
      \ together and expect other people to actually do the work (making the models,\
      \ cutting the code, doing the maps). Those type of people are the ones to avoid\
      \ - they have no knowledge or ability in the work of creating the mod. And often\
      \ they don't want to be involved at all - apart from as an overseer.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<p><b>Swift Viper:</b> Thanks for the help, I already got a lot of ideas/plans\
      \ in a text file and keep adding more and more ideas. Soon I should learn programming\
      \ (hopefully). Is this good enough to say:</p>\n<p>\"I'm making a new mod called\
      \ (name) and information can be found (website). The ideas and some of the programming\
      \ is already done, I'll need # 2D artists, # of 3D artists, # mappers and maybe\
      \ another programmer. If you would like to help e-mail me at (address).\"</p>\n\
      <p>Is that good enough? Again, I won't have to worry about this for awhile as\
      \ I have very little skills in those areas anyway. I don't want to be one of\
      \ those people that \"Can you make this mod for me?\", but one of the ones that\
      \ \"I'm working on this mod and I got some stuff done and would anyone be willing\
      \ to help me please?\". I really want to make my dreams come true, because if\
      \ someone else did it (as in me doing nothing, not team help), it would not\
      \ feel right. I think the best thing to do now is the planning till I get any\
      \ skills in anything.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I'd include a little bit about\
      \ it in the message, like a good novel you'll need to catch the person's interest\
      \ in the beginning if you want them to read more. Due to the frequency of people\
      \ looking for a team, I don't think everyone will go to the website to read\
      \ about it. You certainately don't have to put the whole design document in\
      \ the message, but enough to catch their interest. I'd think so anyway.</p>\n\

      \ Hey sup every1 i hade been thinking bout trying to make a new modd for ut2004\
      \ where every1 could beable to use it and have some fun with it i hope maybe\
      \ ya and so i guess you could say it kindda would be like those really old megaman\
      \ games that came out for the nes system over 14 years ago now and it would\
      \ have some other newer stuff and things added to it also that would make it\
      \ i hope look really kool to play all the time and one of the maps or levels\
      \ would be called ULTRA-WARZ. so i am not really sure how long it would take\
      \ me to try and finish everything since i am just a beginner and just starting\
      \ out with all this modding stuff here, so every1 just let me wat you all think\
      \ bout this idea i hade here ok and thanks every1 bye....</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\

      \ are a few common misunderstandings about this page I'd like to avoid.\n\n\
      * I'm not talking about ''your'' mod or mod concept in particular here, and\
      \ some parts of this article might not even apply to you.\n\n* Neither I nor\
      \ the person posting a link to this article are trying to offend you.\n\n* It\
      \ is not sufficient to read the parts in boldface to understand this article.\
      \  (If it was, I wouldn't have bothered with writing the parts in-between.)\
      \  Especially if you think you don't need this advice, please at least read\
      \ the ''entire'' article and ponder it in order to make that an educated decision,\
      \ not just an offended retort.\n\n...and a '''request to people linking to this\
      \ page:'''  Please be polite and constructive.  Your advice, although probably\
      \ well-meant, is unrequested and most likely unasked for.  If you really want\
      \ to help, be kind.\n\n==Mod Startups ==\n\nI'm writing this in anticipation\
      \ of a surge of calls for new mod teams as soon as [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]]\
      \ is released to the public.  Already now, a couple of weeks before the release\
      \ and still before the demo is officially available, many people are posting\
      \ in forums with their mod ideas in search for a team to make them reality.\n\
      \nUnfortunately, many of those calls are doomed to start with.  Why?  Read on.\n\
      \n===Mod Ideas ===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_userfriendly-modstartups-ideas.gif|center|]]\n\
      \n{{innerbox| Everyone is an idea man. Everybody thinks they have a revolutionary\
      \ new game concept that no one else has ever thought of. Having cool ideas will\
      \ rarely get you anywhere in the games industry. You have to be able to implement\
      \ your ideas or provide some useful skill. This also applies to mod authoring.\
      \ If you become a skilled or notable mod author, you will find people propositioning\
      \ you to implement their ideas.\n<br>\nNever join a project whose idea man or\
      \ leader has no obvious development skills. Never join a project that only has\
      \ a web designer. You have your own ideas. Focus on them carefully and in small\
      \ chunks and you will be able to develop cool projects.\n<br>\n: ''Brandon Reinhart,\
      \ [[Legacy:Mod Authoring/Some Advice To Start With|Mod Authoring]]''}}\n\nThere's\
      \ nothing wrong with enthusiasm or having great ideas that go beyond things\
      \ that already exist.  But enthusiasm and ideas alone don't make a mod; you\
      \ need skilled people for that.  Of course everybody who calls for a mod team\
      \ realizes that.  Only few people realize what such a call takes to be attractive\
      \ though.  Ask yourself:\n\n* '''Why should anybody be interested in joining\
      \ your team?'''  Don't presume that anybody will be awestruck by your idea.\
      \  Everybody is an idea man; rarely a mod fails because the people making it\
      \ ran out of ideas.  Good coders, mappers, modellers, animators, skinners wouldn't\
      \ be that way if they hadn't a whole bunch of ideas of their own.  Especially\
      \ if your idea just marginally improves on an existing idea (like the n-th Counter\
      \ Strike clone, or what appears as one to the casual reader), it's hard to communicate\
      \ the point of your venture to the people who might be able to realize it. \
      \ Besides, people that are good at their respective trade are notoriously busy\
      \ with either their own projects or other team projects they're in.\n\n* '''What\
      \ do you add to the project yourself?'''  Why would anybody want to sacrifice\
      \ their independence to work with you?  If it's just your mod idea, it'd better\
      \ be a damn good one.  Wanting to make a website and PR work won't do.  I'm\
      \ by no means underestimating the value of an attractive website and great PR\
      \ work, but on the priority list of things crucial to creating a good mod those\
      \ items are still ranking below technical skills like modelling, skinning, coding\
      \ and mapping.  On the other hand, if you sort that list by how easy it is to\
      \ find someone who fills those positions, it's exactly upside-down:  If you\
      \ ''have'' a mod, it's not a big deal to do the PR work and a website for it.\n\
      \n* '''Isn't there already another team that does the same?'''  Certainly not\
      \ ''exactly'' the same, but close enough.  Be realistic:  You'll have a better\
      \ chance to end up with a finished thing to be proud of if you're working together\
      \ with other people rather than splitting the (usually small) community that's\
      \ interested in ideas like yours into very small fractions each of which hardly\
      \ has a chance to ever get something with the scope of your (and their) ideas\
      \ done.  You don't have to abandon your own ideas by joining another project.\
      \  If your ideas are good (and the team you're joining is good), they'll be\
      \ open to what you're saying, if you do it in nice way.  Keep in mind:  You\
      \ won't get any recognition at all if you're the leader of a team of one and\
      \ your mod never goes beyond the state of a flashy website.\n\n* '''What kind\
      \ of working relationship do you offer?'''  People (especially those that know\
      \ that you need their help) are hardly inclined to join a team as a mere subject\
      \ to a leader's every whim.  The people you're looking for expect to be treated\
      \ as equals in a team where everybody's opinions are valued.  (Besides, a good\
      \ team doesn't need an official \"lead\" position at all.)\n\nLast, but by no\
      \ means least:  '''Respect the rules of the community you're approaching.'''\
      \  Yeah, it's obvious, but experience tells that it's unfortunately not obvious\
      \ to everyone.  If you're posting in a forum system with many individual forums\
      \ on different topics, don't spam your posting into more than one of those forums.\
      \  All you'll achieve is that people get mad at you before they've even read\
      \ your posting.  It's hard to get somebody to help you who's mad at you to start\
      \ with.  For that matter (if common courtesy isn't enough reason already), don't\
      \ belittle other people or projects in the process of advertising your mod.\n\
      \nIf you don't believe ''me'' on that, read what Pxtl has to say on [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?postid=1423141#post1423141\
      \ Team Fortress mods].\n\n===Concept ===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_userfriendly-modstartups-concept.gif|center|]]\n\
      \nIf you're still confident that there's a good chance that somebody might be\
      \ interested in your mod when you advertise it in a forum posting, '''make a\
      \ concept.'''  Your concept is your mod idea's advertisement; you're about to\
      \ sell your mod idea to other people, so posting something along the lines of\
      \ \"I have a great idea, send me a message if you want to know more\" is completely\
      \ ineffective.  Forum regulars have seen dozens of idea people already, and\
      \ reading your forum posting is the peak of what you'll get of their attention\
      \ at this time.  You have to grab them at this time, or you'll lose them forever.\n\
      \nYour concept doesn't need to be finished to the last detail, but it should\
      \ show that you understand the scope of what you're venturing.  Be realistic,\
      \ not overly enthusiastic.\n\nDon't waste your time with designing an intricate\
      \ internal hierarchy of team members; I've seen mod concepts where that part\
      \ took as much room as the technical concept of the mod itself.  Assign a lead\
      \ coder or lead mapper when you ''have'' those people already and find that\
      \ you need them to efficiently channel your team's organization.  Many teams\
      \ work very well without an internal hierarchy.  In fact, teams frequently work\
      \ ''better'' if everybody feels that they're on an equal footing with the rest\
      \ of the people they work with, and with nobody to scratch their ideas and objections\
      \ with just a shrug and a decree.  (Then again, that really only works with\
      \ the right people; but wait until you find out what kind of internal organization\
      \ works best for your team before you attempt to design one artificially.)\n\
      \nYou can't ''decree'' that your mod is going to be quality; stating so in your\
      \ concept is just a display of hubris (don't you think every mod team tries\
      \ to make a quality mod?).  Making a quality mod is a lot of work, some of which\
      \ is far from being outright fun.  See the [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Modding\
      \ Etiquette|Modding Etiquette]] for a glimpse of it.\n\n==Comments ==\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \  I'm tired of ranting the same over and over again, each time somebody posts\
      \ about his/her ideas for a cool new project in forums in a way that will hardly\
      \ yield any positive result.  Any thoughts on the content?\n\n'''Luggage:'''\
      \ Interesting read. :) I'm just working on a concept paper myself, so it was\
      \ really interesting. This seems to be aimed at community outsiders though,\
      \ I think that only applies to maybe 20-30% of mod makers. Still it was pretty\
      \ interesting to me. :)\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Incidentally, it appears that most\
      \ people posting a request for team members for their new mod ''are'' indeed\
      \ community outsiders.  In any case, they're mostly ''modding'' community outsiders,\
      \ and many of them make the same mistakes:  Thinking that the fact alone that\
      \ they've got an idea will spark everybody's interest, and that technically\
      \ skilled modders are just sitting idly and waiting for an opportunity to join\
      \ somebody with a mod idea (but, in too many cases, hardly any mod making skills)\
      \ because they're out of ideas themselves.\n\n'''Luggage:''' Hehe, true. With\
      \ the concept I spoke of, I'm now trying to get a playable ''interesting'' core\
      \ version done of what will hopefully evolve into a UT2k3 TC. I have the whole\
      \ project in my head and I'm in the process of writing it all up in a concept\
      \ paper, but I'm starting out with the core element of gameplay. The other stuff\
      \ that is planned enhances this further and adds more to the gameplay. Damn,\
      \ this could really work out :)\n\n'''BesigedB:''' The unrealed goblin is coming\
      \ to get you\n\n'''Jb:''' I agree with your thoughts Mychaeel. Its nice to see\
      \ that the people out there have ideas. Speaking of that, with all the new features\
      \ that engine in UT2003 will support I can see a lot more creative ideas coming...How\
      \ about a Tribe2 UT version that works :) heheh j/k\n\n'''Will:''' interesting\
      \ read, Mychaeel, it seems many people who post on forums asking for a mod team\
      \ should really read this first.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Mych takes (almost) sadistic\
      \ delight in posting a link to this page on such threads. (though if he didn't,\
      \ I would. And I'd enjoy it more... bwahaha!) ;)\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' That's what\
      \ I wrote it for, after all.  Much more efficient than ranting anew each and\
      \ every time.  ;-)  Sadly enough, posting the link frequently doesn't cause\
      \ people to read this text, let alone understand it.\n\n'''autocol:''' As someone\
      \ just beginning to take an interest in modifying games (coming from a 3DS animation\
      \ background) I think the best advice for 99% of the people that really need\
      \ to read this is: if you haven't got the skills, don't even bother! The number\
      \ of people that entertain thoughts of being a professional footballer would\
      \ make the mind boggle, but how many make it? As a percentage, close enough\
      \ to zero. I think the number of people who entertain thoughts of creating a\
      \ sweet mod, when compared to the number of people with the talent, vision,\
      \ skills and tenacity to actually create a playable mod, when expressed as a\
      \ percentage, is again, basically zero. I've got an awesome idea for a mod,\
      \ but I think I'll start by creating the SIMPLEST mutator I can think of...\
      \ I think most of the guys that post these \"team requests\" should do the same.\n\
      \n'''Kuhal:''' '''reply to autocol'''  Your analogy is flawed IMO.  The fact\
      \ that very few people achieve something is not good grounds for not trying\
      \ in the first place.  If everyone stopped trying, then there would never be\
      \ any successes right?  And if people without the technical ability don't try...they\
      \ will never get the techincal ability.  If you meant people without '''''potential'''''\
      \ then that's even worse because who can judge someone's potential without having\
      \ spent alot of time with them?  10 years ago it was unheard of for people in\
      \ their own homes to be modelling 3D animations.  It was unheard of for coders\
      \ to be writing a few lines of code and effecting such huge changes to a complex\
      \ game like UT.  Yet today, we have topics dedicated to helping new entrants\
      \ to the modding community to rationalise their chances of success or failure.\
      \  I think this is great progress.  Success of an industry can be measured by\
      \ it's failures as well as it's triumphs.  The more people that try, fail and\
      \ try again the better IMO.  It all adds to a richer community.  I applaud this\
      \ Wiki for attempting to help the majority of would be modders who do not ''yet''\
      \ have the technical ability but want to try.  BTW, there is absolutely no ill\
      \ intent in this message.  Just my rant on Mych's rant triggerd by your comments\
      \ :)  Cheers\n\n'''autocol:''' Fair enough... Strangely, I think we actually\
      \ agree with each other but perhaps I expressed myself poorly. As a relative\
      \ newbie to the idea of modifying games, I've found the Wiki - and various other\
      \ tutorial sites - absolutely invaluable resources in starting to consider creating\
      \ my own game content. Without these resources there's not a snowballs chance\
      \ in hades I would have figured it out. I'm certainly not saying that people\
      \ should just give up and take up knitting, which is perhaps how my original\
      \ comment may have read. What I '''am''' saying is that these people that make\
      \ requests should '''TRY''' some simple mutators, practise some coding/mapping/skinning/whatever-ing\
      \ BEFORE they make these open requests for loads of experienced coders/mappers/skinners/whatever-ers\
      \ to join their mod and make them the gaming equivalent of Bill Gates. I agree\
      \ that \"the more people that try, fail and try again the better.\" (Myself,\
      \ I'm doing a lot of the \"failing\" at this point :)) My rant was really directed\
      \ at those people that can't be bothered with the \"try\" part...\n\n'''Kuhal:'''\
      \ Yep we do agree then.  \n\n'''Githianki:''' Good advice, though a tad \"discouraging\"\
      \ in the intro.  I understand the frustration you are trying to prevent but\
      \ since this is mostly a problem with those new to the scene, the advice needs\
      \ to come in a tone less preachy at the start or people won't read the (rather\
      \ lengthy) entire article.  I know you probably didn't mean it to be preachy\
      \ but context is going to vary with the reader's experience level.  Those who\
      \ are familiar with the mod scene will have patience and see the wisdom in the\
      \ advice you have laid out.  On the other hand, those new to the scene might\
      \ say \"He says he isn't talking about me but then he says to me 'You are here\
      \ because I or someone else think I do need to talk to you'\".  There is a conflicted\
      \ message to the reader there.  If new modders are impatient (and needing the\
      \ advice the most), will they bother to continue reading after that intro? \
      \ Maybe.  The article is good but it could be improved with regards to its intended\
      \ audience. Go for greatness! You are quite clearly capable of it as evidenced\
      \ by your words across this wiki. BTW -its Reinhart not Reinhard, just edited\
      \ little typo away :) \n\n'''Wormbo:''' Does anyone think it's worth mentioning\
      \ the [http://mep.beyondunreal.com/mymod.html SUPER UBER COOL MOD]? ;)\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ yup!\n\n'''Legal:''' Damn you Wormbo, I was just about to!\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:'''\
      \ Tisk, Tisk, Tisk... Even i, a newbie to uscript, could make a better description\
      \ than them. Their mod is destined to SUFFER!!!\n\n'''Cookie:''' One thing this\
      \ page is lacking is a paragragh on copyright laws. It's kinda scary how many\
      \ mod startups think it's perfectly OK to unabashedly rip off another game.\
      \ Especially one that's still in production. People simply DO NOT UNDERSTAND\
      \ (or care about) Copyright Law. (But then they will complain violently about\
      \ people ripping off 'their' ideas.) I would write the article but frankly I\
      \ just don't have the time. Could someone please write something about this\
      \ issue for the benefit of all the new UT2k3 start ups?\n\n'''BM.Deathwind:'''\
      \ @Cookie ... having sorta \"been there done that\" before, I could write up\
      \ an article about copyrights, fair use, etc...  I'm not formally educated in\
      \ Copyright law, so if there's someone around here who is, it might be better\
      \ off in their hands.  But if nothing else, I could certainly create a basic\
      \ explaination, which would typically be enough for those in the mod community.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' I believe that copyright and \"fair use\" issues warrant an\
      \ article of their own (and I'll be happy to link to it from here).  When I\
      \ wrote this rant I didn't even think it'd be necessary to expressly tell people\
      \ to respect other people's intellectual property.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' move &\
      \ refactor tor  [[Legacy:Mod Copyright|Mod copyright]]?\n\n'''Cookie:''' Yeah,\
      \ you're probably right about the copyright issue needing its own discussion\
      \ Mychaeel. Especially when every other Mod-Startup asking for help over on\
      \ BuF is a straight rip-off of another movie or game. I think the biggest problem\
      \ is the oft-stated misconception that's its perfectly OK to steal intellectual\
      \ property, as long as its for \"non-commercial\" use.\n\n'''Legal:''' This\
      \ page should contain this, but where?: Do send emails signed [your mod] but\
      \ do not use [mod's name] as your forum account name.\n\nAnd something about\
      \ spelling, punctation and h4x0rz $p34k.\n\n'''Dante:''' I don't know if it\
      \ fits well in here, but there's a very good post on \"how to recruit a programmer\"\
      \ on http://www.ina-community.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=266017.\n\n\
      '''Mychaeel:''' See [[Legacy:How To Recruit A Programmer|How to Recruit a Programmer]].\n\
      \n'''Dante:''' Maybe I should've tried the \"search\" feature on this wiki...\
      \ ;)\n\n'''Mosquito:'''  Very nice read Mych, but I think there's a couple things\
      \ you need to add.  People need to know how realistic making a mod is and getting\
      \ a team together.  It's like finding a job.  You have to put previous work\
      \ on your resume to get a better chance of getting the job.  You should add\
      \ in that the best way to get team members, is to already have worked on either\
      \ a REALLY nice mod where your work was top notch, or you've done important\
      \ work for 3 or 4 other mods.  That way people can not only see that there's\
      \ proof that you're capable, they can also see the quality of your work.  Mod\
      \ developers look for competent leaders that can take the brunt of the work.\
      \  It's important that you know how to do more then just 1 thing for the mod,\
      \ however coders seem to get the interest these days.  Your right that there\
      \ is a skill ladder, where webpage design is at the bottom and everything else\
      \ above it.  But what if your only skill is mapping? or design map textures?\
      \  Where's the mod going to go with those skills?  Anyways, that's my comments.\n\
      \n'''Sordith:''' Nice read.  Something every new mod developer/indy game developer\
      \ should read.  Another thing you might want to add is an example of a design\
      \ doc.  Some tutorials can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.gamedev.net/reference/list.asp?categoryid=23\n\
      \n'''Pendulum:''' I've read this entire document.  I guess you could call me\
      \ one of those outsiders.  I'm however not going to try and recruit anyone until\
      \ I absolutely need some help.  I'm going to try and do everything I can on\
      \ my own.  I'm not worried about getting my mod done in some specified amount\
      \ of time (even though having the chance to win some of the money in the new\
      \ contest would be nice), so I'm going to learn everything I can and do everything\
      \ I possibly can on my own.  I believe this is the way for me to get the experience\
      \ I need, learn anything and everything.  I'm no artist so that is my weak point,\
      \ but good quality textures and skins aren't the most important thing in my\
      \ opinion, they can wait till closer to the end.  I'm sure everyone else has\
      \ different ideas on this.\n\n'''Swift Viper:''' That page that Wormbo linked\
      \ to was funny! I don't know what is worse, that page or saying New Mod, e-mail\
      \ me for more information. I hate when people do that and they get upset when\
      \ people ask what the mod is (I'm allow to link to threads in the main UT2k3\
      \ fourms right?). Those are the kind of mod team I would not join. I'm confused\
      \ about one thing, how much do you need to know (besides Programming) before\
      \ asking for help? I don't want to miss up someday.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' It's\
      \ not a question of how much you need to know .. it's more a question of what\
      \ you've done already.  For example if you've made a really cool looking weapon,\
      \ modelled, animated, and skinned it - and can't code up the weapon code yourself\
      \ - then asking for a coder's help about the time you are animating the weapon\
      \ would be good.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I agree, you don't have to know how to program\
      \ or anything, but you do need to have done enough to demonstrate that you don't\
      \ expect everyone else to do it for you. If, in Entropic's example above, you\
      \ ask a coder to join you right when you start, then he/she/it is ready to start\
      \ testing and your model is not ready, the programmer may become frustrated\
      \ and unmotivated. Likewise, if you are the programmer, and you ask someone\
      \ to model the weapon for you, they may be disappointed when they are finished\
      \ and can't see their model in the game because you aren't finished yet.\n\n\
      '''Swift Viper:''' So in other words I could program the whole weapon and have\
      \ it working and everything? Is that good enough, so they will only have to\
      \ make the model and import it, then everything is in place? What about the\
      \ maps? As for the model, do I have to make a basic low poly model so someone\
      \ else can get the idea of what it should look like and finish it up and skin\
      \ it? I'm trying to make sure I get it right for when the time comes and not\
      \ mess up and look dumb, but that won't be anytime soon. BTW I might become\
      \ a programmer, so having working code and the ideas done will be enough right?\
      \ Sorry if anything has already been answered or if any questions have been\
      \ repeated, want to make sure I get it right the FIRST time (and reading the\
      \ page a good few times).\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Firstly, don't worry about getting\
      \ the balance right the first few times.  People make mistakes - the trick is\
      \ to learn from them.  Secondly - all people really want is for you to demonstrate\
      \ some ability in terms of actually doing the work to create the mod.  It doesn't\
      \ matter how much (or little) you get done before asking for help - the fact\
      \ that you have done something towards the effort needed to create the mod is\
      \ enough to at least overcome people's initial wariness.\n: There are plenty\
      \ of people who come up with a mod idea, throw a web-site together and expect\
      \ other people to actually do the work (making the models, cutting the code,\
      \ doing the maps).  Those type of people are the ones to avoid - they have no\
      \ knowledge or ability in the work of creating the mod.  And often they don't\
      \ want to be involved at all - apart from as an overseer.\n\n'''Swift Viper:'''\
      \ Thanks for the help, I already got a lot of ideas/plans in a text file and\
      \ keep adding more and more ideas. Soon I should learn programming (hopefully).\
      \ Is this good enough to say:\n\n\"I'm making a new mod called (name) and information\
      \ can be found (website). The ideas and some of the programming is already done,\
      \ I'll need # 2D artists, # of 3D artists, # mappers and maybe another programmer.\
      \ If you would like to help e-mail me at (address).\"\n\nIs that good enough?\
      \ Again, I won't have to worry about this for awhile as I have very little skills\
      \ in those areas anyway. I don't want to be one of those people that \"Can you\
      \ make this mod for me?\", but one of the ones that \"I'm working on this mod\
      \ and I got some stuff done and would anyone be willing to help me please?\"\
      . I really want to make my dreams come true, because if someone else did it\
      \ (as in me doing nothing, not team help), it would not feel right. I think\
      \ the best thing to do now is the planning till I get any skills in anything.\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' I'd include a little bit about it in the message, like a good\
      \ novel you'll need to catch the person's interest in the beginning if you want\
      \ them to read more. Due to the frequency of people looking for a team, I don't\
      \ think everyone will go to the website to read about it. You certainately don't\
      \ have to put the whole design document in the message, but enough to catch\
      \ their interest. I'd think so anyway.\n\n*****UltraHyperCode***** Hey sup every1\
      \ i hade been thinking bout trying to make a new modd for ut2004 where every1\
      \ could beable to use it and have some fun with it i hope maybe ya and so i\
      \ guess you could say it kindda would be like those really old megaman games\
      \ that came out for the nes system over 14 years ago now and it would have some\
      \ other newer stuff and things added to it also that would make it i hope look\
      \ really kool to play all the time and one of the maps or levels would be called\
      \ ULTRA-WARZ. so i am not really sure how long it would take me to try and finish\
      \ everything since i am just a beginner and just starting out with all this\
      \ modding stuff here, so every1 just let me wat you all think bout this idea\
      \ i hade here ok and thanks every1 bye.... \n\n[[Category:Legacy Rant|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
