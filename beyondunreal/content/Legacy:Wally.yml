      <p><b>Jesco:</b> And, if I might add a comment, it wouldn't make much sense:\
      \ Unreal's packages usually contain much more than only textures and the format\
      \ is highly interdependent to a) objects inside themselves and b) other packages.\
      \ Maintaining this interdependency would require one to write a <i>complete</i>\

      \ or darkens the texture like the Lighten and Darken tools when it should add\
      \ a semi-translucent layer of a selected color. Is anyone else experiencing\
