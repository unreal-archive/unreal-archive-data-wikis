      \ probably look at a stock map in <a href=\"/Legacy:UT2003\" title=\"Legacy:UT2003\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\">UT2003</a> such as DM-Antalus or DOM-SepukkuGorge and\
      \ wonder, \"how the heck do you make that terrain like that?\" Well, hopefully\
      \ by the bottom of this page, the how-to part will be less alien to you. In\
      \ the top left <a href=\"/Legacy:Toolbox\" title=\"Legacy:Toolbox\">toolbox</a>\
      \ of UED which contains the tools such as actor scaling, actor rotation, and\
      \ face drag, you will see a shiny (if you're excited about this) button with\
      \ a mountain on it. this is the <b>Terrain Tool.</b> Say good bye to the BSP\
      \ Terrain button. Most of your work will be done in the perspective view, so\
      \ you may want to make it larger when working with terrain.</p>\n<p>The terrain\
      \ tool is actually a collection of several more tools. When clicked, the terrain\
      \ button opens a window containing all the functions you need to take an initially\
      \ flat parcel of land, and 'paint' mountains or valleys on it, flatten them,\
      \ create bumpy ground, paint textures on the surface, carve out holes to allow\
      \ for tunnels and whatnot to connect to it, and scale and rotate those textures.\
      \ The tool generates a heightmap as you edit, eliminating the need to import\
      \ a texture into UnrealEd to add terrain to your level.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ by (64 x Ysize). The default values of 256 x 256 will cause our terrain to\
      \ extend <b>way</b> beyond the dimensions of the cube you created. since our\

      Great! Now we have some nice, completely invisible terrain. Before you can work\
      \ on your terrain (or use the terrain generator) you need to define at least\
      \ a base layer. Open up the texture browser and find the texture you want the\
      \ majority of the terrain to look like. For our example, open the ArboreaTerrain\
      \ package, and find and select Sand01AR. This is a plain dirt texture that makes\
      \ a good base.</li>\n<li>In the Terrain Editing window, click on the Layers\
      \ tab, then click the New... button. This opens a window similar to the New\
      \ Terrain button. Use Mylevel for the Package, and call the layer Dirt_Base\
      \ or something similar so you know what it is. The other properties work as\

      \ component of the Texture or Font will be drawn darker. (or more translucent,\
      \ see <a href=\"/Legacy:Color_Blending\" title=\"Legacy:Color Blending\">color\
      \ blending</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UScale and VScale</td>\n<td>The initial\

      \ scaling with the Texture Scale terrain tool.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><br\
      \ /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hit OK and create the layer. At this point, you should set\

      <p>To change the textures of terrain instead of having the same boring texture\
      \ that doesn't look realistic for mountains or the like, open the terrain tool,\
      \ click on the <a href=\"/Legacy:TerrainInfo\" title=\"Legacy:TerrainInfo\"\
      >TerrainInfo</a> you want to edit, and then click on the 'Layers'</p>\n<p>tab.\
      \ Before you do anything else, open up the Texture Browser and select a texture\
      \ to be used as a new texture for (4 example) your new mountain you want to\
      \ look realistic. Once done that, go back to the 'Terrain Editing Tool' and\
      \ in the 'Layer' tab, click on the button called ' New '. A new window will\
      \ open.</p>\n<p>You'll see Package, Group, Name, Alpha Height, Alpha Width,\
      \ Alpha fill, Color Fill, UScale and VScale. For Package, type in MyLevel. (which\
      \ you should always type in if your doing Terrain or importing of textures or\
      \ w/e) For 'Group', you can either leave it blank, or type in something like\
      \ TerrainLayers. For Name, Type whatever you want, for example, Terrain1. If\
      \ you are a beginner, I would leave the Alpha height and Width , and Alpha Fill\
      \ alone. For color fill, I believe this is the color that will 'Fade' in to\
      \ the other layers when you paint the texture on. This must be a different color\
      \ for each layer. ( Ex- A layer's color fill cannot be the same as another layers\
      \ color fill. Ie. Red-Red is wrong and Red-Blue will work great&#160;;) )</p>\n\
      <p>U and VScale are how big the texture will be. I works exactly like the surface\

      \ with your new layer's settings, click 'Ok .' Now, there should be a new 'Layer'\
      \ called Terrain1 (or w/e you called it under 'Name' ) Now click on the layer\
      \ and then click on the 'Painting' tool under the 'Terrain Editing Tools' Menu.\
      \ Now, on your terrain in your level. Use the paint controls ( CTR+LMB to erase\
      \ the texture and CTR-RMB to add the texture, I believe ) on the area you want\

      \ a 4096*4096 terrain block as it says in the tutorial, it comes out fine. However,\
      \ if I try to make a terrain block that is 49152*49152 I get a GPF. Is there\
      \ some sort of maximum terrain block size? Can someone else try to make a terrain\
      \ block this big (x and y size 768 (768 * 64 = 49152))? I can't think of why\
      \ there would be some limitation on the size of terrain, but it's always possible.\
      \ Situations like this make you wish that UED would handle GPF's gracefully,\
      \ ending the editor seems about the worst possible choice for handling this&#160;:(.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tahngarth:</b> don't <b><i>most</i></b> programs terminate after a GPF?\
      \ A crash generally does end a program after all.</p>\n<p><b>Highlander:</b>\
      \ i have not used terrain quite that large, however with a 512x512 pixel terrain\
      \ map i get a GPF if i smooth over the edge of the map, so id say there is some\
      \ limit to how big the terrain can be. (keep in mind you can scale the terrain\
      \ so that each pixel in the terrain map is worth more than 64 units)</p>\n<p><b>AlphaOne:</b>\
      \ I tried some other tools over the edge of the map (moving away from the center)\
      \ and it always crashed on me. The size of the terrain was double the default\
      \ one. Also, I tried to decorate my map with trees. The static meshes displayed\
      \ strangely: I could only see the leaves. The wooden parts were completely transparent.\
      \ That happened with a couple different tree meshes.???!?!?!?!? Why?</p>\n<p><b>G-LiTe:</b>\
      \ AlphaOne: Some static meshes only have leaves while others are a complete\
      \ tree, they probably had a reason to do that. Look in the static mesh browser\
      \ to see which you can use. Also, you're probably better of placing the trees\
      \ seperately as terrain decolayers are non-solid, which means you'd walk right\
      \ through the tree. (unless that's what you want or it's just background)</p>\n\
      <p><b>AlphaOne:</b> I can see the whole tree. I want to use this methods just\
      \ cause it's easier, and it has a good way of hiding trees from far away.</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd><b>Mychaeel:</b> You can use the static mesh's CullDistance property\
      \ (in the <i>Display</i> section of the property sheet) to the same effect.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<p><b>Tahngarth:</b> the decorations tab is really meant for small things\
      \ like grass and such. In fact I think only flat things will work properly with\
      \ it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> We need screens in here!!</p>\n<hr\
      \ />\n<p><b>Bot 40:</b>Is there any way to rotate a terrain brush? Also, I can't\
      \ find an external paint prog that can read 16 bit grayscale .bmp files so I\
      \ can't rotate the heightmap outside UED and re-import.</p>\n<p><b>Aphex:</b>\

      \ Shadows become more unsharp when the heightmap gets smaller. Shadows are also\

  wikitext:
    text: "'''Tahngarth:''' Here i will try to post a fairly comprehensive guide to\
      \ the terrain tool, geared mostly to beginning mappers, but certainly useful\
      \ to anyone. I will walk through creating a sample peice of terrain and describe\
      \ how the tools are used to accomplish the task.\n\n==Terrain Building Features\
      \ in UED 3.0 ==\n\nA lot of people probably look at a stock map in [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]]\
      \ such as DM-Antalus or DOM-SepukkuGorge and wonder, \"how the heck do you make\
      \ that terrain like that?\" Well, hopefully by the bottom of this page, the\
      \ how-to part will be less alien to you. In the top left [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]]\
      \ of UED which contains the tools such as actor scaling, actor rotation, and\
      \ face drag, you will see a shiny (if you're excited about this) button with\
      \ a mountain on it. this is the '''Terrain Tool.''' Say good bye to the BSP\
      \ Terrain button. Most of your work will be done in the perspective view, so\
      \ you may want to make it larger when working with terrain.\n\nThe terrain tool\
      \ is actually a collection of several more tools. When clicked, the terrain\
      \ button opens a window containing all the functions you need to take an initially\
      \ flat parcel of land, and 'paint' mountains or valleys on it, flatten them,\
      \ create bumpy ground, paint textures on the surface, carve out holes to allow\
      \ for tunnels and whatnot to connect to it, and scale and rotate those textures.\
      \ The tool generates a heightmap as you edit, eliminating the need to import\
      \ a texture into UnrealEd to add terrain to your level.\n\n===Creating Terrain\
      \ and the TerrainInfo Actor ===\n\nSome Terms: \n; heightmap : a greyscale texture\
      \ used by Unrealed to generate terrain - black is low elevation, white is high\
      \ elevation. it should be 64x64 pixels.\n; [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]]\
      \ : this is the actor that makes the terrain exist. The terrain is projected\
      \ using this actor as the 3D origin. also contains the associated variables.\
      \ must be within a [[Legacy:Zone|zone]] that allows terrain to function (bTerrainZone=True)\n\
      \nUnrealed creates your terrain by generating a static mesh based on a heightmap\
      \ texture, centered around a [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]] actor. The TerrainInfo\
      \ actor will be the XYZ origin of your terrain (i.e. the center) so keep that\
      \ in mind when you place the terrain. You need to have empty space to put the\
      \ terrain in, and then create the actor. That said, lets try it:\n\n#Use the\
      \ CubeBuilder to build a cube with dimensions 4096x4096x4096. Center it over\
      \ the origin and subtract. Pick a light colored texture for it, this will make\
      \ the terrain editing easier. \n\n# [[Legacy:Add An Actor|Add an Actor]] >>\
      \ [[Legacy:Info|Info]] >> [[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]] and position it within\
      \ your new space.\n# [[Legacy:Set The Following Properties|Set the following\
      \ properties]] for the ZoneInfo:\n#* ZoneInfo -> bTerrainZone = True (otherwise\
      \ your terrain won't show up)\n#* ZoneLight  -> AmbientLight &ndash; You may\
      \ also want to temporairly set this to to 180 or so, so that you can see your\
      \ terrain when you work on it. Set it back to 0 when you want to put more elaborate\
      \ lighting on it.\n\n#Now click the Terrain Tool button in the top [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]].\
      \ it looks like this: [[Image:Legacy_TerrainIcon.gif|]] . This opens the [[Legacy:Terrain\
      \ Editing|Terrain Editing]] window. Youll want to position this window so the\
      \ perspective view and XY view are reasonably visible.\n\n#The bottom half of\
      \ the window has three tabs:\n\n*Terrains &ndash; shows a list of all of the\
      \ TerrainInfo actors in the level, and on the right side shows the heightmap\
      \ and other information for the currently selected TerrainInfo; and allows you\
      \ to add new TerrainInfos.\n*Layers &ndash; shows the list of layers for the\
      \ current Terrain selected on the Terrains tab. Layers contain the information\
      \ about all the textures that are being used in the terrain. the list is hierarchal,\
      \ with the base layer being shown first. the other layers are \"painted\" on\
      \ top of each other in the order listed.\n*Decorations- Allows you to add features\
      \ to your terrain. <font color=red>Note: </font>any decor you add here won't\
      \ have any collsion (i.e. you can walk through them.) Only use this for things\
      \ such as grass and such that shouldnt impede movement.\n\n\n#Click the New\
      \ button on the Terrains tab to create a new TerrainInfo. This will open up\
      \ the New Terrain window, where you set the following properties: (IMPORTANT-you\
      \ only have one chance to alter the options here, and the [[Legacy:UnrealEd\
      \ Goblin|UnrealEd Goblin]] can become upset when you delete TerrainInfo actors,\
      \ beacuse the heightmap remains in the terrain editor(and your level) list even\
      \ after deleting the actor, and there's no delete button in the Terrain Editing\
      \ window. having UED collect its garbage should fix that(i think), but Let's\
      \ keep the UED goblin happy. :) )\n\n\n{|\n\n|-\n|'''''Property'''''\n|'''''Usage'''''\n\
      |-\n|\n|\n|-\n|Package\n|Specify the name of the package to put the terrain\
      \ information in. For this guide (but also good in practice), put this in [[Legacy:MyLevel|MyLevel]].\n\
      |-\n|Group\n|You can specify a group within the package. Not required, for this\
      \ you can leave it blank.\n|-\n|Name\n|Name your Terrain. Giving it a descriptive\
      \ name will help you identify which is which if you have more than one terrain,\
      \ but for this guide, call it MyTerrain.\n|-\n|Xsize and Ysize\n|Control the\
      \ dimensions of the terrain. It is important to note that these are really scale\
      \ values. That is, the heightmap texture is 64x64 pixels, and the actual dimensions\
      \ of the terrain will be (64 x Xsize) by (64 x Ysize). The default values of\
      \ 256 x 256 will cause our terrain to extend '''way''' beyond the dimensions\
      \ of the cube you created. since our room is 4096 x 4096, set these values to\
      \ 64 (64x64=4096).\n|-\n|Height\n|Self explanitory. Your hills and valleys cant\
      \ stretch outside of this height. You dont need to change this unless you need\
      \ it to be bigger (unlikely). \n|}\n\n When you're satisfied with the values,\
      \ click OK.\n\n#Now position the HeightInfo actor that appears in the level,\
      \ and position it in the center of your cube. <br /><br />Great! Now we have\
      \ some nice, completely invisible terrain. Before you can work on your terrain\
      \ (or use the terrain generator) you need to define at least a base layer. Open\
      \ up the texture browser and find the texture you want the majority of the terrain\
      \ to look like. For our example, open the ArboreaTerrain package, and find and\
      \ select Sand01AR. This is a plain dirt texture that makes a good base.\n#In\
      \ the Terrain Editing window, click on the Layers tab, then click the New...\
      \ button. This opens a window similar to the New Terrain button. Use Mylevel\
      \ for the Package, and call the layer Dirt_Base or something similar so you\
      \ know what it is. The other properties work as follows: \n\n\n{|\n\n|-\n|'''''Property'''''\n\
      |'''''Usage'''''\n|-\n|\n|-\n|AlphaHeight and AlphaWidth\n|These directly affect\
      \ the size of the texture on the landscape. You want these values to match the\
      \ dimensions of the heightmap, which is 64x64 here. Set these accordingly. \n\
      |-\n|AlphaFill\n|Sets the tint and opacity (alpha channel in image editing terms)\
      \ of the layer. This property has four values: A (alpha) and the RGB color channels.\
      \ The base layer should be completely opaque, so set A=0 and R G and B = 255;\
      \ the color box should show white.\n|-\n|ColorFill\n|Color to use for drawing.\
      \ White (R=255,G=255,B=255) means draw everything in its default colors. If\
      \ any color component is lower than 255 the specific color component of the\
      \ Texture or Font will be drawn darker. (or more translucent, see [[Legacy:Color\
      \ Blending|color blending]])\n|-\n|UScale and VScale\n|The initial scaling factors\
      \ of the texture. Leave these at 1, it is easier to adjust the scaling with\
      \ the Texture Scale terrain tool.\n|}\n\n\n\n# Hit OK and create the layer.\
      \ At this point, you should set Realtime Preview on by clicking the little joystick\
      \ in the perspective view. Base layer defined, rebuilding the map should cause\
      \ your terrain's surface to appear. Do a full rebuild of the map.\n\nTa-Da!\
      \ You now have a brand new, tottaly flat and barren parcel of dirt! Now, we\
      \ will discuss how to turn this featureless plane into something more interesting\
      \ first by using the terrain generator, and then by manually editing the surface\
      \ with the terain editor's tools.\n\n===The Terrain Generator ===\n\nCan't think\
      \ of how you want your terrain to look? Want UnrealEd to give you something\
      \ more interesting to start with? Use the terrain generator.\n\nTo use the terrain\
      \ generator, click the Terrain Tool, and in the terrain editing box, select\
      \ your terraininfo. Then look at the top of the terrain editing window, and\
      \ you will see two tabs. The terrain generator is on the tab labled Misc. Just\
      \ supply some parameters, and click Build. Instant mountains. The settings are\
      \ as follows:\n\n{|\n\n|-\n|'''''Setting'''''\n|'''''Function''''' \n|-\n|\n\
      |-\n|Steps\n|Controls how many passes the generator makes over the terrain.\
      \ more steps mean more hills.\n|-\n|Strength\n|Controls the magnitude of the\
      \ hills being generated. Max value 255. High values mean steep, craggy peaks\
      \ that leave almost no place to walk, and low values mean gentle rolling hills\
      \ that are pretty flat overall.\n|-\n|Use entire Heightmap?\n|Tick this to have\
      \ the generated surface use all of the terrain space. Unticked, only uses what\
      \ is currently selected with the Select tool in the terrain editor.\n|}\n\n\
      ===More on Layers ===\n\nIn order to vary the look of your terrain, you must\
      \ add additional layers. Select any additonal textures you want, and when creating\
      \ the layers, set the color settings to the exact opposite of the base layer,\
      \ otherwise the base layer will show over all of the others rendering other\
      \ layers invisible. Say you made some craggy peaks in the terrain you created\
      \ above, and you want them to have a rocky surface different from the dirt texture\
      \ used for the base layer. All you have to do is make a layer with the rocky\
      \ texture, and then use the terrain tools to apply it to the surface. Let's\
      \ look at these tools now.\n\n===The Paint Tool ===\n\nThis tool allows you\
      \ to \"paint\" mountains and valleys on your terrain. This and all of the tools\
      \ in the terrain editor have two functions, controlled by the left mouse button\
      \ and the right. For the paint tool, using cntrl-left mouse button combination\
      \ (hereafter LMB) raises the terrain height where you click in drag in the [3-D\
      \ view], and using the cntrl-right mouse button combination (RMB) lowers it.\
      \ If you find that a huge pillar skyrockets out of the ground where you click,\
      \ just drag the Strength slider to the left to reduce the magnitude of the change.\
      \  \n\n'''Roland:''' But don't select a layer with a texture...if you do this,\
      \ you paint the texture, not the height of the terrain...\n\n===Layering ===\n\
      \nTo change the textures of terrain instead of having the same boring texture\
      \ that doesn't look realistic for mountains or the like,  open the terrain tool,\
      \ click on the [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]] you want to edit, and then\
      \ click on the 'Layers'\n\ntab.  Before you do anything else, open up the Texture\
      \ Browser and select a texture to be used as a new texture for (4 example) your\
      \ new mountain you want to look realistic.  Once done that, go back to the 'Terrain\
      \ Editing Tool' and in the 'Layer' tab, click on the button called ' New '.\
      \  A new window will open.  \n\nYou'll see Package, Group, Name, Alpha Height,\
      \ Alpha Width,  Alpha fill, Color Fill,  UScale and VScale.  For Package, type\
      \ in MyLevel. (which you should always type in if your doing Terrain or importing\
      \ of textures or w/e) For 'Group', you can either leave it blank, or type in\
      \ something like TerrainLayers.  For Name, Type whatever you want, for example,\
      \ Terrain1.  If you are a beginner, I would leave the Alpha height and Width\
      \ , and Alpha Fill alone.  For color fill, I believe this is the color that\
      \ will 'Fade' in to the other layers when you paint the texture on.  This must\
      \ be a different color for each layer. ( Ex- A layer's color fill cannot be\
      \ the same as another layers color fill. Ie. Red-Red is wrong and Red-Blue will\
      \ work great ;) )\n\nU and VScale are how big the texture will be.  I works\
      \ exactly like the surface properties under the tab Pan/Rot/Scale.\n\nFinally,\
      \ when you are satisfied with your new layer's settings, click 'Ok .'  Now,\
      \ there should be a new 'Layer' called Terrain1 (or w/e you called it under\
      \ 'Name' ) Now click on the layer and then click on the 'Painting' tool under\
      \ the 'Terrain Editing Tools' Menu.  Now, on your terrain in your level.  Use\
      \ the paint controls ( CTR+LMB to erase the texture and CTR-RMB to add the texture,\
      \ I believe ) on the area you want to change the texture to.  depending on the\
      \ 'Strength' you set, the texture will 'fade' in covering the older texture.\n\
      \n[[Image:Legacy_myth_terrain_layer1.jpeg|center|Before Layering.]]\n\n[[Image:Legacy_myth_terrain_layer2.jpeg|center|After\
      \ Layering (Three layers : Grass, Mountain Side, Rocky Top.)]]\n\n===Vertex\
      \ Edit Tool ===\n\n===Visibility Tool ===\n\nAt first look at this tool, I thought,\
      \ \"this is a useless tool, a tool that nobody will ever use.\"  I've just found\
      \ out what people use it for.  However, I will just explain this tool and leave\
      \ the implementation up to you, for now at least.  What this tool does is change\
      \ the area that you have used it on, from a solid surface, to a non-solid/invisible\
      \ surface.  CTRL-RMB makes it Invisible/Non-Solid and CTRL-LMB makes it Visible/Solid.\
      \   \n\n===Pitfalls of Terrain Creation in Unreal 2's UnrealEd ===\n\nFor some\
      \ reason, the creation of terrain has been made somewhat tricky, because the\
      \ Terrain Editing palette is missing the ability to create TerrainInfo Actors\
      \ by itself, and of course, a blank heightmap. My guess is that Legend fell\
      \ behind on their updates! The UT2003 editor seems to be in better shape. Honestly\
      \ :rolleyes:\n\nThis means that you have to manually create the TerrainInfo\
      \ actor, and then set the heightmap in the TerrainInfo's properties (e.g. MyLevel.heightmaps.map1).\
      \ The heightmap texture has to already exist, or you'll crash UnrealEd. Then\
      \ you can make use of the Terrain Editing tools in the palette, as above.\n\n\
      ==Discussion ==\n\n'''Birelli:''' When I do this exact procedure with a 4096*4096\
      \ terrain block as it says in the tutorial, it comes out fine. However, if I\
      \ try to make a terrain block that is 49152*49152 I get a GPF. Is there some\
      \ sort of maximum terrain block size? Can someone else try to make a terrain\
      \ block this big (x and y size 768 (768 * 64 = 49152))? I can't think of why\
      \ there would be some limitation on the size of terrain, but it's always possible.\
      \ Situations like this make you wish that UED would handle GPF's gracefully,\
      \ ending the editor seems about the worst possible choice for handling this\
      \ :(.\n\n'''Tahngarth:''' don't '''<i>most</i>''' programs terminate after a\
      \ GPF? A crash generally does end a program after all.\n\n'''Highlander:'''\
      \ i have not used terrain quite that large, however with a 512x512 pixel terrain\
      \ map i get a GPF if i smooth over the edge of the map, so id say there is some\
      \ limit to how big the terrain can be. (keep in mind you can scale the terrain\
      \ so that each pixel in the terrain map is worth more than 64 units)\n\n'''AlphaOne:'''\
      \ I tried some other tools over the edge of the map (moving away from the center)\
      \ and it always crashed on me. The size of the terrain was double the default\
      \ one. Also, I tried to decorate my map with trees. The static meshes displayed\
      \ strangely: I could only see the leaves. The wooden parts were completely transparent.\
      \ That happened with a couple different tree meshes.???!?!?!?!? Why?\n\n'''G-LiTe:'''\
      \ AlphaOne: Some static meshes only have leaves while others are a complete\
      \ tree, they probably had a reason to do that. Look in the static mesh browser\
      \ to see which you can use. Also, you're probably better of placing the trees\
      \ seperately as terrain decolayers are non-solid, which means you'd walk right\
      \ through the tree. (unless that's what you want or it's just background)\n\n\
      '''AlphaOne:''' I can see the whole tree. I want to use this methods just cause\
      \ it's easier, and it has a good way of hiding trees from far away.\n\n:'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ You can use the static mesh's CullDistance property (in the ''Display'' section\
      \ of the property sheet) to the same effect. \n\n'''Tahngarth:''' the decorations\
      \ tab is really meant for small things like grass and such. In fact I think\
      \ only flat things will work properly with it.\n\n----\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:'''\
      \ We need screens in here!!\n\n----\n\n'''Bot 40:'''Is there any way to rotate\
      \ a terrain brush? Also, I can't find an external paint prog that can read 16\
      \ bit grayscale .bmp files so I can't rotate the heightmap outside UED and re-import.\n\
      \n'''Aphex:''' Sure is bot, try here: http://homepage.ntlworld.com/martingbell/ut2003/\n\
      \n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' I have a tutorial on the [[Legacy:Manipulating Terrain|Manipulating\
      \ Terrain]] Page. Have a look!\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I added info on how to  'paint'\
      \ different textures on the same TerrainInfo. (layering)\n\n----\n\n'''Original9:'''\
      \ Shadows become more unsharp when the heightmap gets smaller. Shadows are also\
      \ affected by how big the scale of the terrian is. For example: Lets say that\
      \ the heightmap is 128x128 and has a scale of 196x196x32. If the object is smaller\
      \ the in the quad of the the terrian the shadow will not appear. Taller objects,\
      \ however, will make a blurred shadow.\n\n----\n\n'''MinisterFish:''' For some\
      \ reason, the terrain editor seems broke in UED 3.0 for Unreal 2. I was trying\
      \ different ways in getting it to work but never can get it set up. This tutorial\
      \ can get confusing too, compared to some like the one on leveldesigner.com.\
      \ This page may need to be fused with some other terrain pages.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Much of this is getting refactored into:\n* [[Legacy:Terrain Mode|Terrain\
      \ Mode]] &ndash; overview\n* [[Legacy:Terrain Texture Layer|Terrain Texture\
      \ Layer]] &ndash; adding and editing texture layers\n* [[Legacy:Terrain Decoration\
      \ Layer|Terrain Decoration Layer]] &ndash; adding and editing deco layers (in\
      \ progress!)\n\n----\n\n'''Kerlin:''' Ugh. Maybe [[Legacy:Creating A Terrain|Creating\
      \ A Terrain]] should be pulled into this page. The more I look, the more I find\
      \ stuff that needs reorg. ;) Like I said, if I'm jackin stuff up, let me know...otherwise\
      \ I'm gonna try to help out however I can.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Ah. This page is\
      \ old and I think was up for deletion. I ''was'' cleaning up the terain area\
      \ but I didn't make it all the way through\n\n'''Kerlin:''' Then I guess this\
      \ is a \"Delete Me page\"? Are you sure, though? Seems like some good info here.\
      \ Just want to make sure we don't get rid of it unless it exists elsewhere.\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' It's not yet \"Delete me\". [[Legacy:Terrain|Terrain]] is the\
      \ starting point. there's a few tutorial pages and I've not yet worked out what\
      \ this page does. I'll give it some thought. \n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
