      <p>The only prerequisite for this tutorial is <a href=\"/Legacy:Setting_Up_UnrealScript\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Setting Up UnrealScript\">Setting Up UnrealScript</a>. This\
      \ tutorial assumes you have <a href=\"/Legacy:UMake\" title=\"Legacy:UMake\"\
      >UMake</a> along with a basic <a href=\"/Legacy:Text_Editor\" title=\"Legacy:Text\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>First, <a href=\"/Legacy:Set_Up_Package_Folders\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Set Up Package Folders\">Set Up Package Folders</a> for the\
      \ project. For the purposes of this tutorial I will use the project I am working\
      \ on, \"Shockmanta\": this describes the weapon (shock balls) and the base vehicle\
      \ (manta) and therefore is suitable.</p>\n<p>e.g:</p>\n<pre>c:\\UT2004&gt; mkdir\
      \ MyPackage\nc:\\UT2004&gt; mkdir MyPackage\\Classes\nc:\\UT2004&gt; cd MyPackage\\\
      Classes\n</pre>\n<p>Note: this is not a tutorial on creating a new vehicle.\
      \ We are simply taking a base vehicle and substituting its weapons for others\
      \ that already exist in the game. Choose your vehicle and get the class file\
      \ for it,</p>\n<p>Read <a href=\"/Legacy:Setting_Up_UnrealScript\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Setting Up UnrealScript\">Setting Up UnrealScript</a> for more information</p>\n\
      <p>A few points on where to find them</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The .uc files are within\
      \ classes directories of the root folders</li>\n<li>A cheat sheet is a good\
      \ place to start as the cheat goes</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>summon.(foldername).(classfile)\n\
      </pre>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<pre>summon.onslaught.onshoverbike\n</pre>\n<p>...summons\
      \ a manta</p>\n<p>So copy the class file for the vehicle into the new folder</p>\n\
      <p>e.g:</p>\n<pre>c:\\UT2004\\MyPackage\\Classes&gt; copy C:\\UT2004\\Onslaught\\\
      Classes\\ONSHoverBike.uc .\\ShockManta.uc\n</pre>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Modifying the vehicle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This is really just a case working it out yourself\
      \ but i will give you a few guide lines to get you on your way</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change\
      \ the file name of the Vehicle you want to modify</li>\n</ul>\n<p>eg.</p>\n\
      <p>ONSHoverBike.uc to ShockManta.uc</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the top in the file there\
      \ is a line that says:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>class ONSHoverBike extends ONSHoverCraft</p>\n\
      <p>change it to:</p>\n<p>class ShockManta extends ONSHoverBike</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You\
      \ must set the class to the name of the .uc file otherwise it will not compile</li>\n\
      <li>If you are only modifying the weapon it is probably best to extend the original\
      \ vehicle (ONSHoverBike) but if you are going to do some serious modification\
      \ you are best subclassing the <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Vehicle_Class?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Vehicle Class (page does not exist)\">vehicle\
      \ class</a> and copying the code from a vehicle within it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>eg.</p>\n\
      <p>class ShockManta extends ONSHoverCraft</p>\n<p>Code from ONSHoverBike (which\
      \ you can then modify)</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modifying_the_vehicle_weapon\"\

      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>For weapons it is probably\
      \ best to start with the <i>default properties</i> section (near the bottom)</p>\n\
      <p>You will find a line that starts with DriverWeapons(0)=</p>\n<p>The Weaponclass\
      \ is the code for the bit that fires (I will go on to this later) and the weaponbone\
      \ is the bone in the sceletal mesh that the firing bit is attached to (don't\
      \ change it unless you've make your own vehicle and know the bone names)</p>\n\
      <p>You could change it to something like this:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"\
      mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n\
      <pre class=\"de1\">DriverWeapons<span class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"nu0\"\

      sy0\">=</span>PlasmaGunAttachment<span class=\"br0\">)</span>;</pre></div>\n\
      </div>\n<p>You're best off getting the WeaponClass from another vehicle (open\
      \ the class and paste it into the new vehicle)</p>\n<p>This is the primary weapons\
      \ control for just about all vehicles (driver) and as you can probably see all\
      \ I have done is replaced the manta weapon with the same bit in the ONSShocktank\
      \ .uc file (OnslaughtBP folder if you are interested)</p>\n<p>Passenger weapons\
      \ are similar</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\"\

      \ to find the problem in the code (the red text may give a hint) and try to\

      \ an ONSFactory (it doesn't matter which one [I used ONSArtilleryFactory completely\

      \ i.e. you want to change the power/speed etc. of the weapon so...</p>\n<p>You\
      \ do basically the same thing as you did with the first script. What you need\
      \ to look for is in your first script (see above) for something that looks like\
      \ the extention of the weapon, this will be found in the default properties\
      \ under something like projectileclass etc.</p>\n<p>You then find the script\
      \ file for this (referred to as [rta] old file) and similar to above you change\
      \ the file name and the internal class name at the top, save it ([rta]new file)\
      \ and go back to your first script(the one above). Then change the place where\
      \ you found the file name to your new file (don't forget to put the rootfolderofyourmod.thenewfilename\
      \ in correctly), also make sure that all of the references of the old file are\
      \ replaced with you new file. Wow it's complicated when you try to explain it\
      \ (this probably means its hard to understand).</p>\n<p>Again you either have\
      \ the knack or you don't in which case I suggest getting someone to do it for\

      \ Up UnrealScript|Setting Up UnrealScript]]. This tutorial assumes you have\
      \ [[Legacy:UMake|UMake]] along with a basic [[Legacy:Text Editor|text editor]].\n\
      \n==Copying your vehicle==\n\nFirst, [[Legacy:Set Up Package Folders|Set Up\
      \ Package Folders]] for the project. For the purposes of this tutorial I will\
      \ use the project I am working on, \"Shockmanta\": this describes the weapon\
      \ (shock balls) and the base vehicle (manta) and therefore is suitable. \n\n\
      e.g:\n c:\\UT2004> mkdir MyPackage\n c:\\UT2004> mkdir MyPackage\\Classes\n\
      \ c:\\UT2004> cd MyPackage\\Classes\n\nNote: this is not a tutorial on creating\
      \ a new vehicle.  We are simply taking a base vehicle and substituting its weapons\
      \ for others that already exist in the game.  Choose your vehicle and get the\
      \ class file for it, \n\nRead [[Legacy:Setting Up UnrealScript|Setting Up UnrealScript]]\
      \ for more information\n\nA few points on where to find them\n* The .uc files\
      \ are within classes directories of the root folders\n* A cheat sheet is a good\
      \ place to start as the cheat goes \n summon.(foldername).(classfile)\n\ne.g.\n\
      \ summon.onslaught.onshoverbike\n\n...summons a manta\n\nSo copy the class file\
      \ for the vehicle into the new folder\n\ne.g: \n c:\\UT2004\\MyPackage\\Classes>\
      \ copy C:\\UT2004\\Onslaught\\Classes\\ONSHoverBike.uc .\\ShockManta.uc\n\n\
      ==Modifying the vehicle==\n\nThis is really just a case working it out yourself\
      \ but i will give you a few guide lines to get you on your way\n\n* Change the\
      \ file name of the Vehicle you want to modify\n\neg.\n\nONSHoverBike.uc to ShockManta.uc\n\
      \n* At the top in the file there is a line that says:\n\nclass ONSHoverBike\
      \ extends ONSHoverCraft\n\nchange it to:\n\nclass ShockManta extends ONSHoverBike\n\
      \n* You must set the class to the name of the .uc file otherwise it will not\
      \ compile\n* If you are only modifying the weapon it is probably best to extend\
      \ the original vehicle (ONSHoverBike) but if you are going to do some serious\
      \ modification you are best subclassing the [[Legacy:Vehicle Class|vehicle class]]\
      \ and copying the code from a vehicle within it\n\neg.\n\nclass ShockManta extends\
      \ ONSHoverCraft\n\nCode from ONSHoverBike (which you can then modify)\n\n==Modifying\
      \ the vehicle weapon==\n\nFor weapons it is probably best to start with the\
      \ ''default properties'' section (near the bottom)\n\nYou will find a line that\
      \ starts with DriverWeapons(0)=\n\nThe Weaponclass is the code for the bit that\
      \ fires (I will go on to this later) and the weaponbone is the bone in the sceletal\
      \ mesh that the firing bit is attached to (don't change it unless you've make\
      \ your own vehicle and know the bone names)\n\nYou could change it to something\
      \ like this:\n\n<uscript>DriverWeapons(0)=(WeaponClass=class'OnslaughtBP.ONSShockTankCannon',WeaponBone=PlasmaGunAttachment);</uscript>\n\
      \nYou're best off getting the WeaponClass from another vehicle (open the class\
      \ and paste it into the new vehicle)\n\nThis is the primary weapons control\
      \ for just about all vehicles (driver) and as you can probably see all I have\
      \ done is replaced the manta weapon with the same bit in the ONSShocktank .uc\
      \ file (OnslaughtBP folder if you are interested)\n\nPassenger weapons are similar\n\
      \n<uscript>PassengerWeapons(0)=(WeaponPawnClass=class'ONSTankSecondaryTurretPawn',WeaponBone=MachineGunTurret)</uscript>\n\
      \nI have used the Goliath mini gun as an example.\n\nMultiple passengers have\
      \ the similar properties e.g. the Leviathan\n\n<uscript>\n    DriverWeapons(0)=(WeaponClass=class'OnslaughtFull.ONSMASRocketPack',WeaponBone=RocketPackAttach);\n\
      \    DriverWeapons(1)=(WeaponClass=class'OnslaughtFull.ONSMASCannon',WeaponBone=MainGunPostBase);\n\
      \tPassengerWeapons(0)=(WeaponPawnClass=class'OnslaughtFull.ONSMASSideGunPawn',WeaponBone=RightFrontGunAttach);\n\
      \tPassengerWeapons(1)=(WeaponPawnClass=class'OnslaughtFull.ONSMASSideGunPawn',WeaponBone=LeftFrontGunAttach);\n\
      \tPassengerWeapons(2)=(WeaponPawnClass=class'OnslaughtFull.ONSMASSideGunPawn',WeaponBone=RightRearGunAttach);\n\
      \tPassengerWeapons(3)=(WeaponPawnClass=class'OnslaughtFull.ONSMASSideGunPawn',WeaponBone=LeftRearGunAttach);\n\
      </uscript>\n\nNote that passenger weapons classes are a subclass of WeaponPawn\
      \ whereas the main weapon is subclass of Weapon.\n\nThe driver's alt fire is\
      \ different from vehicle to vehicle.  The manta crushes, the goliath zooms,\
      \ the leviathan deploys.  Maybe the raptor is the place to start if you want\
      \ the driver to be able to fire multiple weapons.  You are looking for something\
      \ like:\n\n<uscript>function AltFire</uscript>\n\nAnd again just copy the bits\
      \ you need\n\n* Don't forget the name of your .uc must match the classname of\
      \ your modified vehicle.  NEVER EDIT THE ORIGINAL FILES or you will break network\
      \ play.\n\n==Compiling the scripts==\n\n#Open UMake\n#Put in C:\\UT2004\\(your\
      \ folder name)\n#Click 'compile'\n#It will go through a list of packages\n#If\
      \ it fails, go up the list (in details) and find the bits in red (if you can't\
      \ find any then it has probably compiled OK [please tell me if I'm wrong]) try\
      \ to find the problem in the code (the red text may give a hint) and try to\
      \ compile again - if the problem reoccurs try rewriting the code all over -\
      \ you can also try the Atari forums (programming section) and PM me if you are\
      \ really desperate (blip2)\n#Once you're compiled go into UEd and in the actor\
      \ browser open the .u file in the system directory with your modified vehicle's\
      \ name in it you should then be able to get the vehicle by placing an ONSFactory\
      \ (it doesn't matter which one [I used ONSArtilleryFactory completely at random]\
      \ and changed the SVehicleFactory >> VehicleClass property to your vehicle (it\
      \ should show up in the list if you did everything properly)\n\n==Extending\
      \ the changes==\n\nOften just changing the basic weapon is not enough i.e. you\
      \ want to change the power/speed etc. of the weapon so...\n\nYou do basically\
      \ the same thing as you did with the first script. What you need to look for\
      \ is in your first script (see above) for something that looks like the extention\
      \ of the weapon, this will be found in the default properties under something\
      \ like projectileclass etc.\n\nYou then find the script file for this (referred\
      \ to as [rta] old file) and similar to above you change the file name and the\
      \ internal class name at the top, save it ([rta]new file) and go back to your\
      \ first script(the one above). Then change the place where you found the file\
      \ name to your new file (don't forget to put the rootfolderofyourmod.thenewfilename\
      \ in correctly), also make sure that all of the references of the old file are\
      \ replaced with you new file. Wow it's complicated when you try to explain it\
      \ (this probably means its hard to understand).\n\nAgain you either have the\
      \ knack or you don't in which case I suggest getting someone to do it for you\
      \ (I wish you luck :-D)\n\n&ndash;Turrets (ToDo)&ndash;\n\n==See also==\n* [[Legacy:Vehicle\
