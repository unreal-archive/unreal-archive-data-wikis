      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Sounds like this page should actually be named \"Static\
      \ Mesh Ideas.\" – When <a href=\"/Legacy:Mod_Ideas\" title=\"Legacy:Mod Ideas\"\
      >Mod Ideas</a> started, it was a subpage of <a href=\"/Legacy:EntropicLqd\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:EntropicLqd\">EntropicLqd</a>'s personal page. People picked\
      \ it up and added more and more ideas, and <b>then</b> that page was moved to\
      \ a page of its own and <b>then</b> it was put on the main page and <b>then</b>\
      \ we did some PR around it.</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> Yeah, I know, I thought that\
      \ n00bs would find it more easily&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> My point\
      \ is that usually inventions like <a href=\"/Legacy:Mod_Ideas\" title=\"Legacy:Mod\
      \ Ideas\">Mod Ideas</a> follow a need, not vice-versa.</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b>\
      \ Ok, delete it if nobody posts here within a week&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Oxygen:</b>\
