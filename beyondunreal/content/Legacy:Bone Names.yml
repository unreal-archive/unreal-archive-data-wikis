      <p>Bones cause a lot of confusion among Unreal Engine modders (and possibly\
      \ licensees too). Part of this is the naming scheme. There are 2 types of bones,\
      \ which do not share names and are in no way related. The names of some coincide,\
      \ but that does not indicate that they are the same bone, thus adding to the\
      \ confusion. The two type of bones are <a href=\"/Legacy:Skeletal_Mesh\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Skeletal Mesh\">skeletal mesh</a> animation bones and <a href=\"/Legacy:Karma\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Karma\">Karma</a> ragdoll bones. Ragdoll bones exist only in\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:UT2003\" title=\"Legacy:UT2003\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UT2003</a>.</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>Skeletal Animation Bones</dt>\n<dd>These are the bones used when creating\
      \ skeletal animation to import via UnrealEd. These are the bones affected by\
      \ PlayAnim and LoopAnim. These names can be viewed through the UnreadEd <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Animation_Browser\" title=\"Legacy:Animation Browser\">Animation Browser</a>\
      \ by clicking View -&gt; Bonenames.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Karma Ragdoll Bones</dt>\n\
      <dd>These are the \"bone\" definitions used by the <a href=\"/Legacy:Karma_Ragdoll\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Karma Ragdoll\">Karma Ragdoll</a> physics. They do not interact\
      \ in any way with Skeletal Animation bones, however, they can interact to a\
      \ limited extent with script bones. You can find the information on these bones\
      \ in the .ka files in the KarmaData subdirectory of the directory in which UT2003\
      \ was installed. These files have some formatting but can be deciphered with\
      \ relative ease.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Skeletal_Animation_Bones\"\

      \ etc.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Well that just sucks! I was all pumped up to\
      \ attach emitters to them after I saw that they sub-classed xPawn... so how\
      \ can I attach an emitter to a monster without attaching it to a specific bone\
      \ and have it follow it around?</p>\n<p><b>Ass2iN:</b> Yea, Wormbo was right\
      \ SVehicles do have bones. Mythopus I have no idea how you could attatch an\
      \ emitter to a monster without bones. Sry&#160;:(</p>\n<p><b>Lilguy:</b> You\
      \ could always use SetBase() but that won't let you attach it to something like\
      \ a foot that moves around very much; It will always have the same relative\
      \ offset. That might be good enough, but it'll look funny if you tried to do\
      \ something like attach a piece of armor or something, since the attachment\
      \ won't keep up with the animation.</p>\n<p><b>LionsPhil:</b> Which are the\
      \ karma bones? The .ka files are (invalid – multiple duplicate IDs) XML, and\
      \ each asset entity has 'geometry', 'model', 'part' (I suspect it's this one,\
      \ after poking KAT), 'no_collision' (ok, it isn't this one&#160;;) ) and 'joint'\
      \ (nor this) entities. Annoyingly, all have IDs containing spaces, yet actors\
      \ which use these bone names such as <a href=\"/Legacy:KConstraint\" title=\"\
      Legacy:KConstraint\">KConstraint</a> define the type of arguments such as <code>KConstraintBone1</code>\
      \ as <code>name</code>, and UnrealEd refuses to keep spaces in these values\
      \ (or any characters after the first space).</p>\n<p><b>Switch`:</b> Names with\
      \ spaces need double quotes.</p>\n<p><b>LionsPhil:</b> *slaps forehead* Thanks...I\
      \ <i>really</i> should have thought of that...</p>\n<p><b>Guest:</b>(TurkeyFromHell)\
      \ Would it be possible to determine the nearest bone that a projectile would\
      \ hit on impact? ok so that wasnt a good way to word that, here's a better way\
      \ to put it: projectile hits the player -&gt; how would i figure out which bone(s)\
      \ of the mesh it would hit? is there a way to determine the nearest bone to\
      \ the vector HitLocation?</p>\n<p><b>EricBlade:</b> UT04 has a function \"GetNearestBone\"\
      \ or something similar. '03 may have had it, but it doesn't appear to be a part\
      \ of the stock engine in 2226, as my game is missing it, and has to calculate\

  wikitext:
    text: "==Types of Bones==\n\nBones cause a lot of confusion among Unreal Engine\
      \ modders (and possibly licensees too). Part of this is the naming scheme. There\
      \ are 2 types of bones, which do not share names and are in no way related.\
      \ The names of some coincide, but that does not indicate that they are the same\
      \ bone, thus adding to the confusion. The two type of bones are [[Legacy:Skeletal\
      \ Mesh|skeletal mesh]] animation bones and [[Legacy:Karma|Karma]] ragdoll bones.\
      \ Ragdoll bones exist only in [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]]. \n\n; Skeletal Animation\
      \ Bones: These are the bones used when creating skeletal animation to import\
      \ via UnrealEd. These are the bones affected by PlayAnim and LoopAnim. These\
      \ names can be viewed through the UnreadEd [[Legacy:Animation Browser|Animation\
      \ Browser]] by clicking View -> Bonenames.\n\n; Karma Ragdoll Bones: These are\
      \ the \"bone\" definitions used by the [[Legacy:Karma Ragdoll|Karma Ragdoll]]\
      \ physics. They do not interact in any way with Skeletal Animation bones, however,\
      \ they can interact to a limited extent with script bones. You can find the\
      \ information on these bones in the .ka files in the KarmaData subdirectory\
      \ of the directory in which UT2003 was installed. These files have some formatting\
      \ but can be deciphered with relative ease.\n\n==Skeletal Animation Bones==\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' I vote that we break this into subpages - one subpage for each\
      \ model, and it would include that model's Skeletal Animation Bones, Karma Ragdoll\
      \ Bones, and known script bones.\n\n====Jugg====\n\n Bip01\n  +- Bip01 Pelvis\n\

      \n'''Foxpaw:''' Someone feel free to fill this in, or follow my suggestion above.\n\
      \n==Bones in UnrealScript==\n\nFollowing section should be moved somewhere,\
      \ eg [[Legacy:Attaching To Bones|Attaching To Bones]].\n\nYou can refer to individual\
      \ bones using some native functions in UnrealScript. When referring to these\
      \ bones, you can use the full name of the bone, though this works only for bones\
      \ set up in the defaultproperties if the bone name has a space in it, in my\
      \ experience. As an alternative, you can refer to a bone using it's '''attachalias.'''\
      \ If the bone name does not have a space in it, you can just use the full name\
      \ of the bone.\n\nAttachAliases can be set up in the Animations browser in UnrealEd.\
      \ Select the '''Mesh''' tab in the animation properties box to the right of\
      \ the 3D pane of the animations browser. From there, expand '''attach''', and\
      \ then expand '''sockets'''. This reveals a dynamic array of attachment information,\
      \ including the attachaliases and some options for the facing of actor attached\
      \ to that bone.\n\nHere is an example of how to refer to bones in Unrealscript:\n\
      \n<uscript>\n  // Substitite Actor for the actor you want to attach, and lfarm\
      \ for the\n  // attachalias or name of the bone you want to use.\n  AttachToBone(\
      \ Actor, 'lfarm' );\n\n  // Use this to detach it from that bone. You do not\
      \ need to specify what bone\n  // it is attached to.\n  DetachFromBone( Actor\
      \ );\n</uscript>\n\n==Comments==\n\n'''Holim''' Then what about weapon bones?\
      \ I've seen the bones used in the weapon animations except when you play the\
      \ animations the links seem to be able to scale and move!? Is there any rigged\
      \ weapon models out there in MAX format?\n\n'''FrozenCow''' Bone_L_shoulder\
      \ and Bone_R_shoulder of the Bot need to be Bone_Lshoulder and Bone_Rshoulder\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' if you're suggesting a correction, go ahead and make it in\
      \ the page :)\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Can anyone get the MONSTER bone names?\n\n\
      '''Wormbo:''' Those are no skeletal meshes, so they don't have any bone names.\n\
      \n'''Newbie:''' Yes, vehicles and monsters have no bones. Only players. (Kinda\
      \ makes sense dont it :P) I also fixed Bone_L_shoulder and Bone_R_shoulder to\
      \ Bone_Lshoulder and Bone_Rshoulder.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Actually, [[Legacy:SVehicle|SVehicle]]s\
      \ do have bones for wheels, turrets etc.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Well that just sucks!\
      \  I was all pumped up to attach emitters to them after I saw that they sub-classed\
      \ xPawn... so how can I attach an emitter to a monster without attaching it\
      \ to a specific bone and have it follow it around?\n\n'''Ass2iN:''' Yea, Wormbo\
      \ was right SVehicles do have bones. Mythopus I have no idea how you could attatch\
      \ an emitter to a monster without bones. Sry :(\n\n'''Lilguy:''' You could always\
      \ use SetBase() but that won't let you attach it to something like a foot that\
      \ moves around very much; It will always have the same relative offset. That\
      \ might be good enough, but it'll look funny if you tried to do something like\
      \ attach a piece of armor or something, since the attachment won't keep up with\
      \ the animation.\n\n'''LionsPhil:''' Which are the karma bones? The .ka files\
      \ are (invalid &ndash; multiple duplicate IDs) XML, and each asset entity has\
      \ 'geometry', 'model', 'part' (I suspect it's this one, after poking KAT), 'no_collision'\
      \ (ok, it isn't this one ;) ) and 'joint' (nor this) entities. Annoyingly, all\
      \ have IDs containing spaces, yet actors which use these bone names such as\
      \ [[Legacy:KConstraint|KConstraint]] define the type of arguments such as <code>KConstraintBone1</code>\
      \ as <code>name</code>, and UnrealEd refuses to keep spaces in these values\
      \ (or any characters after the first space).\n\n'''Switch`:''' Names with spaces\
      \ need double quotes.\n\n'''LionsPhil:''' *slaps forehead* Thanks...I ''really''\
      \ should have thought of that...\n\n'''Guest:'''(TurkeyFromHell) Would it be\
      \ possible to determine the nearest bone that a projectile would hit on impact?\
      \ ok so that wasnt a good way to word that, here's a better way to put it: projectile\
      \ hits the player -> how would i figure out which bone(s) of the mesh it would\
      \ hit? is there a way to determine the nearest bone to the vector HitLocation?\n\
      \n'''EricBlade:''' UT04 has a function \"GetNearestBone\" or something similar.\
      \  '03 may have had it, but it doesn't appear to be a part of the stock engine\
      \ in 2226, as my game is missing it, and has to calculate it on it's own. :("
