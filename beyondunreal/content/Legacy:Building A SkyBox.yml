      <p>The <a href=\"/Legacy:SkyBox\" title=\"Legacy:SkyBox\">SkyBox</a> is a method\
      \ of adding a continuous sky above a map.</p>\n<p>A nice skybox adds greatly\
      \ to the realism of an outdoor map or an indoor map with windows. It also adds\
      \ to the realistic effect of moving from one point to another one in a map.</p>\n\
      <p>A skybox is much better than adding a small box containing sky <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Texture_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Texture (UT)\">Texture (UT)s</a> just\
      \ outside of each individual window.</p>\n<p>A skybox can be almost any shape\
      \ but a box is usually used because it is easier to align the textures than\
      \ a cylinder, trapezoid, or sphere. A sphere should be avoided because of texture\
      \ alignment problems.</p>\n<p>Probably the best way to get to understand the\
      \ design of the skybox is just open a map in UnrealEd that has sky that you\
      \ like. They are generally simple; just a cube with size selected to fit the\
      \ textures used, lighting, and one or two transparent sheets on top for the\
      \ actual sky texture. I would suggest the CTF-EpicBoy skybox as an optimal design.\
      \ They can be quite complex, however, with multiple movers and decorations,\
      \ and numerous textures with different surface properties set.</p>\n<p><a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Sunlight\" title=\"Legacy:Sunlight\">Sunlights</a> are a special kind\
      \ of light, casting parallel shadows. They had to be placed in a skybox and\
      \ pointed at the SkyZoneInfo actor to be effective.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\
      mw-headline\" id=\"A_Simple_SkyBox\">A Simple SkyBox</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: A Simple SkyBox\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Subtract a box some distance away from your\
      \ level (If it is too close, it may cast a shadow!) The size depends on the\
      \ backdrop textures you plan to use. Say you're using a texture set consisting\
      \ of 8 panels and each is 512x512. A skybox that is 1024x1024x512 high should\
      \ suffice. A typical skybox is 128*1024*1024.</li>\n<li>Make sure your textures\
      \ are aligned. You may have to select <i>No Smooth</i> in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Properties\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Surface Properties\" class=\"mw-redirect\">surface properties</a>\
      \ to prevent seams at the edges of the sky box itself.</li>\n<li>You can also\
      \ throw in a sheet with a moon texture in the sky or some clouds for extra foggy\
      \ effect.</li>\n<li>Do your lighting to get it looking the way you want it.</li>\n\
      <li>Add a <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\">Actor</a> &gt;&gt;\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Info_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Info (UT)\">Info (UT)</a> &gt;&gt;\

      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:SkyZoneInfo\" title=\"Legacy:SkyZoneInfo\">SkyZoneInfo</a>\
      \ actor in the middle of the skybox.</li>\n<li>Back on your level, select the\
      \ surfaces on which you want the sky depicted. Open the <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Properties_Window\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Surface Properties Window\">Surface Properties Window</a> and\
      \ in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Flags_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Surface Flags\
      \ (UT)\">Surface Flags (UT)</a> tab check <i>Fake Backdrop</i> and <i>Unlit</i>.\
      \ If you don't make it unlit than your level's lighting might spoil the nice\
      \ lighting in your skybox. Experiment with this aspect if you'd like.</li>\n\
      <li>Rebuild your level.</li>\n<li>To see the skybox projected on surfaces in\
      \ the editor, make sure <a href=\"/Legacy:Realtime_Preview\" title=\"Legacy:Realtime\

      <p>This is another way of creating a nice skybox. Im using Devastation for the\
      \ basic tutorial, but im sure the procedure for other editors should be roughly\
      \ the same.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Needs rewriting so it DOESN'T use Devastation</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>subtract a box a little bit away from your level. Make it 1024x1024x1024.\
      \ The size does'nt really matter that much, but its better to be too big rather\
      \ than too small.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Go into the Embarcadero package and\
      \ look for the sky static mesh. Many of the static mesh packages in devastation\
      \ have a suitable mesh in them, so feel free to use another one.</li>\n</ol>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>Place the static mesh inside the box, roughly in the middle. Add a\
      \ SkyZone Info actor right in the middle of the static mesh sky.</li>\n</ol>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>The fake backdrop procedure remains the same using this method so\
      \ refer to the previous section for information on how to get the skybox to\
      \ work.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Re<a href=\"/Legacy:Build\" title=\"Legacy:Build\"\
      >build</a> your level. To view the sky, right click on a 3d Viewport and select\
      \ View-&gt;Show backdrop.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note: you can add another static mesh\
      \ around the skyzone info too for added effect, although this is not vital.</p>\n\

      \ title=\"Edit section: UT3 Skydome\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>UT3 no longer uses sky boxes. Instead of setting a\
      \ fake backdrop surface property, maps with outdoor view now need to be crated\
      \ with additive geometry and a sky dome static mesh. Open any retail map to\
      \ see how that works.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"UT3_Fake_Skybox\"\

      \ UT3 Fake Skybox\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>While UT3 no longer has SkyZoneInfos and dedicated sky boxes, it is still\
      \ possible to fake the effect with a cube map material. This cube map can either\
      \ be created from a set of textures or you can use the <a href=\"/UE3:SceneCaptureCubeMapActor_(UT3)\"\
      \ title=\"UE3:SceneCaptureCubeMapActor (UT3)\">SceneCaptureCubeMapActor</a>\
      \ to capture a live view of an actual sky box like it was done in earlier generations\
      \ of the Unreal Engine.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> A fake sky box like this will only\
      \ provide visuals. Unlike in earlier engine generations, lights in the sky box\
      \ will <i>not</i> affect anything in the main area!</p>\n<p>Here's how a sky\
      \ box with the SceneCaptureCubeMapActor should be set up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create\
      \ your map and sky box area as usual</li>\n<li><a href=\"/Legacy:Add_An_Actor\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Add An Actor\">Add an actor</a> &gt;&gt; SceneCaptureActor\
      \ &gt;&gt; SceneCaptureCubeMapActor to your sky box as if it was a SkyZonInfo.\
      \ SceneCaptureActors are not static, so you could even animate it using <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Kismet\" title=\"Legacy:Kismet\">Kismet</a>/<a href=\"/Legacy:Matinee\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Matinee\">Matinee</a>.</li>\n<li>Now you need to set up the\
      \ properties of the <a href=\"/UE3:SceneCaptureCubeMapComponent_(UT3)\" title=\"\
      UE3:SceneCaptureCubeMapComponent (UT3)\">SceneCaptureCubeMapComponent</a> in\
      \ the SceneCaptureCubeMapActor's SceneCaptureActor -&gt; SceneCapture property.<br\
      \ />\nIn its Capture group, <a href=\"/Legacy:Set_The_Following_Properties\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Set The Following Properties\">set the following properties</a>:\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>bEnableFog&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Set this to True if your sky box uses fog,\
      \ otherwise keep it false.</dd>\n<dt>ClearColor&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Set this to\
      \ your sky box fog color.</dd>\n<dt>FarPlane&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Set this high enough\
      \ so all visible parts of the skybox are closer than this value.</dd>\n<dt>NearPlane&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Set this to a value low enough that objects close to the SceneCaptureCubeMapActor\
      \ are not clipped.</dd>\n<dt>ViewMode&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Make sure this is set\
      \ to SceneCapView_Lit, otherwise lights and/or shadows in your sky box will\
      \ be ignored.</dd>\n<dt>FrameRate&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Set this to 0 for a still-image\
      \ sky box and otherwise to a reasonably high value so your skybox animation\
      \ doesn't look choppy. This property has a huge impact on the performance of\
      \ your map and higher values may cause the player's frame rate to drop due to\
      \ the additional rendering work.</dd>\n<dt>TextureTarget&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This\
      \ is where the actual magic happens. Use the Generic Browser's File -&gt; New...\
      \ menu to create a new \"RenderToTextureCube\" and assign that texture to this\
      \ property. Tweak the texture's size to an acceptable value so it won't blur\
      \ out when a player gets close to the window in your map's main area, but don't\
      \ make it too larger either because that will affect performance similar to\
      \ increasing your in-game screen resolution.</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now\
      \ that you have a static TextureCube or a dynamic TextureRenderTargetCube. Note\
      \ that the above procedure is very similar to setting up a surveillance camera,\
      \ except that you use <a href=\"/UE3:SceneCapture2DActor_(UT3)\" title=\"UE3:SceneCapture2DActor\
      \ (UT3)\">SceneCapture2DActor</a> instead of SceneCaptureCubeMapActor and RenderToTexture\
      \ instead of RenderToTextureCube.</p>\n<p>Now you only need to create a material\
      \ that you can apply to the surfaces where your sky box should be visible:</p>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>In the Generic Browser do File -&gt; New... to create a new Material,\
      \ which will translate the cube map into the backdrop effect.</li>\n<li>Open\
      \ the new material in the Material Editor.</li>\n<li>Add a new Texture Sample,\
      \ set its Texture property to the cube map of your sky box and connect its RGB\
      \ output (black) to the material's Emissive input.</li>\n<li>Add a new Multiply\
      \ and connect its output to the Texture Sample's UV input.</li>\n<li>Add a new\
      \ Vector Transform.</li>\n<li>Add a new Constant3Vector, entering the RGB values\
      \ as 1, 1, -1 respectively.</li>\n<li>Connect the Constant3Vector and the Vector\
      \ Transform to the Multiply</li>\n<li>Add a new Camera Vector and connect its\
      \ output to the Vector Transform's input.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you're done,\
      \ your material setup should be similar to the one shown below.</p>\n<div class=\"\
      center\">\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_fakeSkyBoxMaterial.jpeg\"\

      Material setup for the sky box cube map\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_fakeSkyBoxMaterial.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"978\" height=\"412\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<p>The material can now\
      \ be applied to the window surface (or the sides of a subtracted cube) through\
      \ which the sky box should be visible from within the main area of your map.</p>\n\
      <p>Note: For anyone interested, the Multiply is used here to flip the Z because\
      \ otherwise the material would display the captured area inverted in the Z axis.\
      \ Additionally, Multiply can be replaced with Divide (with the same RGB values)\
      \ if Vector Transform links to the A input and the Constant3Vector links to\
      \ the B input (A / B).</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Experiment\"\

    text: "==Introduction==\n\nThe [[Legacy:SkyBox|SkyBox]] is a method of adding\
      \ a continuous sky above a map.\n\nA nice skybox adds greatly to the realism\
      \ of an outdoor map or an indoor map with windows.  It also adds to the realistic\
      \ effect of moving from one point to another one in a map.\n\nA skybox is much\
      \ better than adding a small box containing sky [[Legacy:Texture (UT)|Texture\
      \ (UT)]]s just outside of each individual window.\n\nA skybox can be almost\
      \ any shape but a box is usually used because it is easier to align the textures\
      \ than a cylinder, trapezoid, or sphere.  A sphere should be avoided because\
      \ of texture alignment problems.\n\nProbably the best way to get to understand\
      \ the design of the skybox is just open a map in UnrealEd that has sky that\
      \ you like. They are generally simple; just a cube with size selected to fit\
      \ the textures used, lighting, and one or two transparent sheets on top for\
      \ the actual sky texture. I would suggest the CTF-EpicBoy skybox as an optimal\
      \ design. They can be quite complex, however, with multiple movers and decorations,\
      \ and numerous textures with different surface properties set.  \n\n[[Legacy:Sunlight|Sunlight]]s\
      \ are a special kind of light, casting parallel shadows. They had to be placed\
      \ in a skybox and pointed at the SkyZoneInfo actor to be effective.\n\n==A Simple\
      \ SkyBox==\n* Subtract a box some distance away from your level (If it is too\
      \ close, it may cast a shadow!)  The size depends on the backdrop textures you\
      \ plan to use.  Say you're using a texture set consisting of 8 panels and each\
      \ is 512x512.  A skybox that is 1024x1024x512 high should suffice. A typical\
      \ skybox is 128*1024*1024.\n* Make sure your textures are aligned.  You may\
      \ have to select ''No Smooth'' in the [[Legacy:Surface Properties|surface properties]]\
      \ to prevent seams at the edges of the sky box itself.\n* You can also throw\
      \ in a sheet with a moon texture in the sky or some clouds for extra foggy effect.\n\
      * Do your lighting to get it looking the way you want it.\n* Add a [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]]\
      \ >> [[Legacy:Info (UT)|Info (UT)]] >> [[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]] >> [[Legacy:SkyZoneInfo|SkyZoneInfo]]\
      \ actor in the middle of the skybox.\n* Back on your level, select the surfaces\
      \ on which you want the sky depicted. Open the [[Legacy:Surface Properties Window|Surface\
      \ Properties Window]] and in the [[Legacy:Surface Flags (UT)|Surface Flags (UT)]]\
      \ tab check ''Fake Backdrop'' and ''Unlit''. If you don't make it unlit than\
      \ your level's lighting might spoil the nice lighting in your skybox. Experiment\
      \ with this aspect if you'd like.\n* Rebuild your level.\n* To see the skybox\
      \ projected on surfaces in the editor, make sure [[Legacy:Realtime Preview|realtime\
      \ preview]] mode is turned on in the 3D [[Legacy:UnrealEd Viewport|UnrealEd\
      \ Viewport]].\n\n==Advanced Skyboxes==\n\n* [[Legacy:MultiSkyBox|MultiSkyBox]]\n\
      * [[Legacy:Rotating Skybox|Rotating skybox]]\n* [[Legacy:RockingSkyZoneInfo|Moving\
      \ skybox]]\n\n==Static Mesh Skyboxes==\n\nThis is another way of creating a\
      \ nice skybox. Im using Devastation for the basic tutorial, but im sure the\
      \ procedure for other editors should be roughly the same. \n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Needs rewriting so it DOESN'T use Devastation \n\n# subtract a box a little\
      \ bit away from your level. Make it 1024x1024x1024. The size does'nt really\
      \ matter that much, but its better to be too big rather than too small.\n\n\
      # Go into the Embarcadero package and look for the sky static mesh. Many of\
      \ the static mesh packages in devastation have a suitable mesh in them, so feel\
      \ free to use another one.\n\n# Place the static mesh inside the box, roughly\
      \ in the middle. Add a SkyZone Info actor right in the middle of the static\
      \ mesh sky.\n\n# The fake backdrop procedure remains the same using this method\
      \ so refer to the previous section for information on how to get the skybox\
      \ to work.\n\n# Re[[Legacy:Build|build]] your level. To view the sky, right\
      \ click on a 3d Viewport and select View->Show backdrop.\n\nNote: you can add\
      \ another static mesh around the skyzone info too for added effect, although\
      \ this is not vital.\n\n==UT3 Skydome==\n\nUT3 no longer uses sky boxes. Instead\
      \ of setting a fake backdrop surface property, maps with outdoor view now need\
      \ to be crated with additive geometry and a sky dome static mesh. Open any retail\
      \ map to see how that works.\n\n==UT3 Fake Skybox==\n\nWhile UT3 no longer has\
      \ SkyZoneInfos and dedicated sky boxes, it is still possible to fake the effect\
      \ with a cube map material. This cube map can either be created from a set of\
      \ textures or you can use the [[UE3:SceneCaptureCubeMapActor (UT3)|SceneCaptureCubeMapActor]]\
      \ to capture a live view of an actual sky box like it was done in earlier generations\
      \ of the Unreal Engine.\n\n'''Note:''' A fake sky box like this will only provide\
      \ visuals. Unlike in earlier engine generations, lights in the sky box will\
      \ ''not'' affect anything in the main area!\n\nHere's how a sky box with the\
      \ SceneCaptureCubeMapActor should be set up:\n\n# Create your map and sky box\
      \ area as usual\n# [[Legacy:Add An Actor|Add an actor]] >> SceneCaptureActor\
      \ >> SceneCaptureCubeMapActor to your sky box as if it was a SkyZonInfo. SceneCaptureActors\
      \ are not static, so you could even animate it using [[Legacy:Kismet|Kismet]]/[[Legacy:Matinee|Matinee]].\n\
      # Now you need to set up the properties of the [[UE3:SceneCaptureCubeMapComponent\
      \ (UT3)|SceneCaptureCubeMapComponent]] in the SceneCaptureCubeMapActor's SceneCaptureActor\
      \ -> SceneCapture property.<br />In its Capture group, [[Legacy:Set The Following\
      \ Properties|set the following properties]]:\n#; bEnableFog : Set this to True\
      \ if your sky box uses fog, otherwise keep it false.\n#; ClearColor : Set this\
      \ to your sky box fog color.\n#; FarPlane : Set this high enough so all visible\
      \ parts of the skybox are closer than this value.\n#; NearPlane : Set this to\
      \ a value low enough that objects close to the SceneCaptureCubeMapActor are\
      \ not clipped.\n#; ViewMode : Make sure this is set to SceneCapView_Lit, otherwise\
      \ lights and/or shadows in your sky box will be ignored.\n#; FrameRate : Set\
      \ this to 0 for a still-image sky box and otherwise to a reasonably high value\
      \ so your skybox animation doesn't look choppy. This property has a huge impact\
      \ on the performance of your map and higher values may cause the player's frame\
      \ rate to drop due to the additional rendering work.\n#; TextureTarget : This\
      \ is where the actual magic happens. Use the Generic Browser's File -> New...\
      \ menu to create a new \"RenderToTextureCube\" and assign that texture to this\
      \ property. Tweak the texture's size to an acceptable value so it won't blur\
      \ out when a player gets close to the window in your map's main area, but don't\
      \ make it too larger either because that will affect performance similar to\
      \ increasing your in-game screen resolution.\n\nNow that you have a static TextureCube\
      \ or a dynamic TextureRenderTargetCube. Note that the above procedure is very\
      \ similar to setting up a surveillance camera, except that you use [[UE3:SceneCapture2DActor\
      \ (UT3)|SceneCapture2DActor]] instead of SceneCaptureCubeMapActor and RenderToTexture\
      \ instead of RenderToTextureCube.\n\nNow you only need to create a material\
      \ that you can apply to the surfaces where your sky box should be visible:\n\
      \n# In the Generic Browser do File -> New... to create a new Material, which\
      \ will translate the cube map into the backdrop effect.\n# Open the new material\
      \ in the Material Editor.\n# Add a new Texture Sample, set its Texture property\
      \ to the cube map of your sky box and connect its RGB output (black) to the\
      \ material's Emissive input.\n# Add a new Multiply and connect its output to\
      \ the Texture Sample's UV input.\n# Add a new Vector Transform.\n# Add a new\
      \ Constant3Vector, entering the RGB values as 1, 1, -1 respectively.\n# Connect\
      \ the Constant3Vector and the Vector Transform to the Multiply \n# Add a new\
      \ Camera Vector and connect its output to the Vector Transform's input.\n\n\
      Once you're done, your material setup should be similar to the one shown below.\n\
      \n[[Image:Legacy_fakeSkyBoxMaterial.jpeg|center|Material setup for the sky box\
      \ cube map]]\n\nThe material can now be applied to the window surface (or the\
      \ sides of a subtracted cube) through which the sky box should be visible from\
      \ within the main area of your map.\n\nNote: For anyone interested, the Multiply\
      \ is used here to flip the Z because otherwise the material would display the\
      \ captured area inverted in the Z axis. Additionally, Multiply can be replaced\
      \ with Divide (with the same RGB values) if  Vector Transform links to the A\
      \ input and the Constant3Vector links to the B input (A / B).\n\n==Experiment==\n\
      :...with colored lighting, various textures and translucency effects.  [[Legacy:Colors|Colors]]\n\
      :...with moving the skybox info actor around in your skybox and see what happens\
