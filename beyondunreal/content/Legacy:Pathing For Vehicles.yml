      <p>Vehicles are large and difficult to navigate in tight spaces. Vehicles too\
      \ close to obstacles like map layout elements, decorative objects, or other\
      \ vehicles will be hard for bots to get into and navigate with. When placing\
      \ paths nodes that vehicles might use, make sure there is a lot of room to leave\
      \ each spawn spot and be aware of areas (like PowerNodes) where bots and players\
      \ will want to exit the vehicle, do something and get back in. Often gridlock\
      \ can occur if RoadPaths are too close together near such areas. Nodes used\
      \ to find and enter larger vehicles (like HellBenders or larger) should be away\
      \ from the center of the vehicle (like towards the driver's side door), otherwise\
      \ bots will get stuck trying to enter.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ here is the K.I.S.S. principle...Keep It Simple Stupid! The more complex and\
      \ meandering you make the <a href=\"/Legacy:RoadPathNode\" title=\"Legacy:RoadPathNode\"\
      >RoadPathNode</a> routing, the worse the bots will drive and the less likely\
      \ it is that they will directly attack the other base.</p>\n<p>In normal <i>pedestrian</i>\
      \ gametypes, sometimes more is better with PathNodes to ensure that the bots\
      \ can get everywhere on the level. Not so with vehicles. Just lay down the RoadPathNodes\
      \ where you need the bots to drive the vehicles and nowhere else. The simpler\
      \ and the more straight-forward the layout of the nodes, the better.</p>\n<p>One\
      \ huge problem with this is that the default range setting on a RoadPathNode\
      \ is 10,000 <a href=\"/Legacy:UU\" title=\"Legacy:UU\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      >UU</a> (Unreal Units). If you put them down without adjusting this property,\
      \ they will connect all over the level and the bots will go nuts and likely\
      \ never reach the objective. I don't know any shortcuts for doing this other\
      \ than to place 4 or 5 RPNs and then set their range and build the paths. If\
      \ you get two-way pathing for all the Nodes, then you are in good shape. If\
      \ they make connections you did not intend for them to make, then reduce the\
      \ distance until they drop the connection. If they do not connect as a two-way\
      \ point, then shorten it up a bit until they do. Sound tedious? Yeah it is,\
      \ but the end result is well worth the trouble.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here's a screenie\
      \ of the editor to show you what it should look like:</p>\n<div class=\"center\"\
      >\n<div class=\"floatnone\"><a href=\"/File:Legacy_VehiclePathing.jpeg\" class=\"\
      image\" title=\"Road Pathing on VCTF-Strip Mine\"><img alt=\"Road Pathing on\
      \ VCTF-Strip Mine\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_VehiclePathing.jpeg\" width=\"767\"\
      \ height=\"598\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<p>Here's is Steve Polge's summation\
      \ of the rest of it:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>\"The larger\
      \ vehicles require white (or forced vehicle) paths connected to the objective\
      \ (flag base) and all assault paths. If the vehicle can't get all the way to\
      \ the objective, make sure they can get to the assault paths for the objective,\
      \ and then they'll continue on foot.</p>\n<p>Also, objectives have a VehiclePathName\
      \ property. If you can't get a vehicle path all the way to the objective, set\
      \ the VehiclePathName to the name (under the object tab) of the nearest NavigationPoint\
      \ that vehicles can reach.</p>\n<p>If you need to force paths for vehicles,\
      \ you'll need to check bVehicleDestination in the destination NavigationPoint\
      \ properties, and then add a forced path in the normal manner.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n\
      </blockquote>\n<p>The bottom line is that if you do not have an all white path\
      \ between the objectives, the bots will not play the game properly. As Steve\
      \ states above, if the bots can't reach the objective in the vehicle, then you'll\
      \ have to use an assault Path to get them there. His instructions are spot-on.\
      \ Follow them carefully and it will work for you.</p>\n<p>The other instructive\
      \ thing I learned from this lengthy exercise is that very few existing CTF levels\
      \ will make for really good VCTF maps if you plan to use bots. I suppose you\
      \ can jack an ONS map and convert it, but remember that the main deal in VCTF\
      \ is they have to do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get in a vehicle and drive\
      \ as close as possible to the objective.</li>\n<li>Exit the vehicle and grab\
      \ the objective.</li>\n<li>Make their way back to the vehicle with the objective\
      \ and get into it.</li>\n<li>Drive back to their own base with the objective.</li>\n\
      <li>Get out of the vehicle and make the capture.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That is not\
      \ what happens in ONS and the A.I. in the maps is not set-up to facilitate it\
      \ happening. If you use a base ONS map, dump the existing A.I. and start building\
      \ it from scratch. I haven't even begun to mess with the FlyingPathNodes, but\
      \ as you can't carry the flag in either a Raptor or a Manta, who cares? I put\
      \ some into a level and they connected and it seemed to work okay as long they\
      \ covered the map with their connections...Here's another tip, though, wait\
      \ to do the FlyingPathNodes until you're just about 100% done with the RoadPathNodes.\
      \ Once they are in place, with View Paths enabled, the map looks like an explosion\
      \ in an orange spaggetti factory...i.e. - You can't see a thing after that.</p>\n\

      <p>I have discovered a few additional key points to note in the construction\
      \ of a VCTF level:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using an <a href=\"/Legacy:AssaultPath\" title=\"\
      Legacy:AssaultPath\">AssaultPath</a> after the last RoadPathNode that vehicles\
      \ can reach works, and works well, but introduces new and even more complex\
      \ issues into the equation. Someone else mentioned it in another thread, but\
      \ what good is it to have your bot grab the flag and then not have a vehicle\
      \ available when it returns to the RoadPathed area of the map? The best bet\
      \ is to have the flag in an area where it can make a double (bi-directional)\
      \ white connection to one or more RoadPathNodes.</li>\n<li>Think vertical and\
      \ you can have your cake and eat it too. I have created a second elevated level\
      \ that is pathed just for foot use and it also connects to both flags and, even\
      \ though the bots use it, it does not preclude them from using the vehicles\
      \ as well. In fact, combos are very possible as I have seen them use the overhead\
      \ route to get the flag and then jump into a Tank or a Hell Bender that one\
      \ of their team-mates is using and hitch a ride home...</li>\n<li>The Teleporter\
      \ definitely needs to be in the game-type. The bots commonly chase a team-mate's\
      \ vehicle with it and will jump on-board in mid-toss...It is extremely cool\
      \ to watch them do this...</li>\n<li>When the flag is in a vehicle accessible\
      \ area, elevate it above the floor on some type of base that the bots can climb\
      \ on foot, but not in a vehicle. I am using an octagonal base that is about\
      \ 256 units in diameter and about 40 units high. It has 4 narrow stairwells\
      \ cut into it (one on every other side) that the bots can use. It is high enough\
      \ to stop a vehicle (except for the Leviathan), but not so high that the nearby\
      \ RoadPathNodes cannot make a good path connection. (<i>Why do you need this?\
      \ Because the bots playing defense will pile into a Goliath and camp the flag\
      \ if they can get on top of it...and I mean literally ON TOP of it. An enemy\
      \ bot cannot get to it to take the flag if they are there. This is a workaround\
      \ of sorts, but it is an effective one as even if they are using a Tank, if\
      \ the attacker engages them, another bot can come up form behind and take the\
      \ flag...I've watched it a dozen times.</i>)</li>\n<li>As I said above, the\
      \ 40 unit high barrier will not stop a Leviathan...Hence, tip #5 is do not path\
      \ the Leviathans if you have them in your level. If a Masterful bot gets into\
      \ one of them with a couple of his pals, the other team is in big trouble. It's\
      \ better to keep them out the Leviathans unless a human is driving it. (<b>GreatEmerald</b>:\
      \ If you need a Leviathan, though, you can set some RoadPathNodes' properties,\
      \ under Navigation Point, bNoSuperSize to True to keep Leviathans out of some\
      \ trouble. This way you can also make a defensive Leviathan by setting bNoSuperSize\
      \ properties only to those nodes that are close to flags, although bots might\
      \ not want to go in. You might also path everything normally, add an AssaultPath\
      \ somewhat away from the flag and make all next PathNodes/RoadPathNodes bNoSuperSize\
      \ to make bots use Leviathans, but not spam with them.)</li>\n<li>RoadPathNodes\
      \ can be further cleaned up by changing the MaxRoadDistance value in the properties.\
      \ The default distance is ten thousand. This can create ALL KINDS of unwanted\
      \ clutter. In the top orthographic view measure between the nodes that you want\
      \ to connect using SHIFT+MIDDLEMOUSE to bring up the ruler and adjust the nodes\
      \ accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"External_Links\"\

      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> This is a common pathing problem, akin to bots getting \"\

      \ the paths from the vehicle (spawn point) all the way to the enemy flag are\
      \ not <u>all</u> white (the widest) paths. Added Blit'z Pathing Tut in External\

    text: "The common use of vehicles in [[Legacy:UT2004|UT2004]] prompts mappers\
      \ to take precautions and add special navigation paths for maps that include\
      \ vehicles.  Once properly connected to the network, bots will use the vehicles\
      \ to travel on the special paths for road and sky navigation.  Proper connection\
      \ to the botpath network includes a complete path connection (one where each\
      \ path is white, indicating the widest path) from vehicle spawn point to game\
      \ objective.\n\n'''Note:''' The main focus on this page began with Vehicle CTF,\
      \ but these concepts apply to pathing for all vehicle gametypes.\n\n===Parking\
      \ Spots===\n\nVehicles are large and difficult to navigate in tight spaces.\
      \  Vehicles too close to obstacles like map layout elements, decorative objects,\
      \ or other vehicles will be hard for bots to get into and navigate with.  When\
      \ placing paths nodes that vehicles might use, make sure there is a lot of room\
      \ to leave each spawn spot and be aware of areas (like PowerNodes) where bots\
      \ and players will want to exit the vehicle, do something and get back in. \
      \ Often gridlock can occur if RoadPaths are too close together near such areas.\
      \  Nodes used to find and enter larger vehicles (like HellBenders or larger)\
      \ should be away from the center of the vehicle (like towards the driver's side\
      \ door), otherwise bots will get stuck trying to enter.\n\n===RoadPathNodes===\n\
      \nRoadPathNodes define safe and easy places for ground-based vehicles to navigate.\
      \  Because vehicles take up much more space than players, RoadPathNodes could\
      \ always be connected by WHITE path nodes; detnoting the widest path available.\
      \  It should be noted, however, that driving bots will use normal PathNodes\
      \ as well, as long as they are wide enough.  See also [[Legacy:RoadPathNode|RoadPathNode]]s.\n\
      \n===FlyingPathNodes===\n\nFlyingPathNodes indicate clear paths through the\
      \ sky for flying vehicles.  See also [[Legacy:Pathing 2k4 Flying_Vehicles|Pathing\
      \ 2k4 Flying_Vehicles]] and [[Legacy:FlyingPathNode|FlyingPathNode]]s.\n\n==Vehicle\
      \ (VCTF) Pathing Info by Toonces T. Cat\t==\n\nThe prime directive here is the\
      \ K.I.S.S. principle...Keep It Simple Stupid! The more complex and meandering\
      \ you make the [[Legacy:RoadPathNode|RoadPathNode]] routing, the worse the bots\
      \ will drive and the less likely it is that they will directly attack the other\
      \ base. \n\nIn normal ''pedestrian'' gametypes, sometimes more is better with\
      \ PathNodes to ensure that the bots can get everywhere on the level.  Not so\
      \ with vehicles.  Just lay down the RoadPathNodes where you need the bots to\
      \ drive the vehicles and nowhere else. The simpler and the more straight-forward\
      \ the layout of the nodes, the better.\n\nOne huge problem with this is that\
      \ the default range setting on a RoadPathNode is 10,000 [[Legacy:UU|UU]] (Unreal\
      \ Units). If you put them down without adjusting this property, they will connect\
      \ all over the level and the bots will go nuts and likely never reach the objective.\
      \ I don't know any shortcuts for doing this other than to place 4 or 5 RPNs\
      \ and then set their range and build the paths. If you get two-way pathing for\
      \ all the Nodes, then you are in good shape. If they make connections you did\
      \ not intend for them to make, then reduce the distance until they drop the\
      \ connection. If they do not connect as a two-way point, then shorten it up\
      \ a bit until they do. Sound tedious? Yeah it is, but the end result is well\
      \ worth the trouble.\n\n----\n\nHere's a screenie of the editor to show you\
      \ what it should look like:\n\n[[Image:Legacy_VehiclePathing.jpeg|center|''Road\
      \ Pathing on VCTF-Strip Mine'']]\n\n----\n\nHere's is Steve Polge's summation\
      \ of the rest of it: \n\n{{innerbox|\n\"The larger vehicles require white (or\
      \ forced vehicle) paths connected to the objective (flag base) and all assault\
      \ paths. If the vehicle can't get all the way to the objective, make sure they\
      \ can get to the assault paths for the objective, and then they'll continue\
      \ on foot.\n\nAlso, objectives have a VehiclePathName property. If you can't\
      \ get a vehicle path all the way to the objective, set the VehiclePathName to\
      \ the name (under the object tab) of the nearest NavigationPoint that vehicles\
      \ can reach.\n\nIf you need to force paths for vehicles, you'll need to check\
      \ bVehicleDestination in the destination NavigationPoint properties, and then\
      \ add a forced path in the normal manner.\n\n\n}}\n\nThe bottom line is that\
      \ if you do not have an all white path between the objectives, the bots will\
      \ not play the game properly. As Steve states above, if the bots can't reach\
      \ the objective in the vehicle, then you'll have to use an assault Path to get\
      \ them there. His instructions are spot-on. Follow them carefully and it will\
      \ work for you.\n\nThe other instructive thing I learned from this lengthy exercise\
      \ is that very few existing CTF levels will make for really good VCTF maps if\
      \ you plan to use bots.  I suppose you can jack an ONS map and convert it, but\
      \ remember that the main deal in VCTF is they have to do the following:\n\n\
      # Get in a vehicle and drive as close as possible to the objective.\n# Exit\
      \ the vehicle and grab the objective.\n# Make their way back to the vehicle\
      \ with the objective and get into it.\n# Drive back to their own base with the\
      \ objective.\n# Get out of the vehicle and make the capture.\n\nThat is not\
      \ what happens in ONS and the A.I. in the maps is not set-up to facilitate it\
      \ happening. If you use a base ONS map, dump the existing A.I. and start building\
      \ it from scratch. I haven't even begun to mess with the FlyingPathNodes, but\
      \ as you can't carry the flag in either a Raptor or a Manta, who cares? I put\
      \ some into a level and they connected and it seemed to work okay as long they\
      \ covered the map with their connections...Here's another tip, though, wait\
      \ to do the FlyingPathNodes until you're just about 100% done with the RoadPathNodes.\
      \ Once they are in place, with View Paths enabled, the map looks like an explosion\
      \ in an orange spaggetti factory...i.e. - You can't see a thing after that.\n\
      \n==Additional VCTF (VehicleCTF) Level Tips by Toonces T. Cat==\n\nI have discovered\
      \ a few additional key points to note in the construction of a VCTF level:\n\
      \n#Using an [[Legacy:AssaultPath|AssaultPath]] after the last RoadPathNode that\
      \ vehicles can reach works, and works well, but introduces new and even more\
      \ complex issues into the equation. Someone else mentioned it in another thread,\
      \ but what good is it to have your bot grab the flag and then not have a vehicle\
      \ available when it returns to the RoadPathed area of the map? The best bet\
      \ is to have the flag in an area where it can make a double (bi-directional)\
      \ white connection to one or more RoadPathNodes.\n#Think vertical and you can\
      \ have your cake and eat it too. I have created a second elevated level that\
      \ is pathed just for foot use and it also connects to both flags and, even though\
      \ the bots use it, it does not preclude them from using the vehicles as well.\
      \ In fact, combos are very possible as I have seen them use the overhead route\
      \ to get the flag and then jump into a Tank or a Hell Bender that one of their\
      \ team-mates is using and hitch a ride home...\n#The Teleporter definitely needs\
      \ to be in the game-type. The bots commonly chase a team-mate's vehicle with\
      \ it and will jump on-board in mid-toss...It is extremely cool to watch them\
      \ do this...\n#When the flag is in a vehicle accessible area, elevate it above\
      \ the floor on some type of base that the bots can climb on foot, but not in\
      \ a vehicle. I am using an octagonal base that is about 256 units in diameter\
      \ and about 40 units high. It has 4 narrow stairwells cut into it (one on every\
      \ other side) that the bots can use. It is high enough to stop a vehicle (except\
      \ for the Leviathan), but not so high that the nearby RoadPathNodes cannot make\
      \ a good path connection.  (''Why do you need this? Because the bots playing\
      \ defense will pile into a Goliath and camp the flag if they can get on top\
      \ of it...and I mean literally ON TOP of it. An enemy bot cannot get to it to\
      \ take the flag if they are there. This is a workaround of sorts, but it is\
      \ an effective one as even if they are using a Tank, if the attacker engages\
      \ them, another bot can come up form behind and take the flag...I've watched\
      \ it a dozen times.'')\n#As I said above, the 40 unit high barrier will not\
      \ stop a Leviathan...Hence, tip #5 is do not path the Leviathans if you have\
      \ them in your level. If a Masterful bot gets into one of them with a couple\
      \ of his pals, the other team is in big trouble. It's better to keep them out\
      \ the Leviathans unless a human is driving it. ('''GreatEmerald''': If you need\
      \ a Leviathan, though, you can set some RoadPathNodes' properties, under Navigation\
      \ Point, bNoSuperSize to True to keep Leviathans out of some trouble. This way\
      \ you can also make a defensive Leviathan by setting bNoSuperSize properties\
      \ only to those nodes that are close to flags, although bots might not want\
      \ to go in. You might also path everything normally, add an AssaultPath somewhat\
      \ away from the flag and make all next PathNodes/RoadPathNodes bNoSuperSize\
      \ to make bots use Leviathans, but not spam with them.)\n#RoadPathNodes can\
      \ be further cleaned up by changing the MaxRoadDistance value in the properties.\
      \ The default distance is ten thousand. This can create ALL KINDS of unwanted\
      \ clutter. In the top orthographic view measure between the nodes that you want\
      \ to connect using  SHIFT+MIDDLEMOUSE to bring up the ruler and adjust the nodes\
      \ accordingly.\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://blitz.unrealplayground.com/tutorials/bots.html\

      \ will not drive it anywhere and just stay in place.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' This\
      \ is a common pathing problem, akin to bots getting \"stuck\".  In this case,\
      \ the bot knows the vehicle is desirable, but the destination isn't clear, so\
      \ it jumps back out or sits there.  In real terms, this means the paths from\
      \ the vehicle (spawn point) all the way to the enemy flag are not <u>all</u>\
      \ white (the widest) paths.  Added Blit'z Pathing Tut in External Links, which\
      \ includes this explanation on the \"white road\":\n\n{{innerbox| ''In other\
      \ words, think of this as a single, white road that connects to each vehicle\
      \ and each objective. Bots will only understand how to reach objectives if there\
      \ is a white route from the vehicle they just hopped into to the objective they're\
      \ seeking. If this route doesn't exist, then the bot will abandon the vehicle\
      \ and proceed on foot.''\n\n}}\n\n'''LionsPhil:''' Aww. Am I so wrong for feeling\
      \ sorry for bots who have found a shiny tank to play with, but can't work out\
      \ where to take it? ;)\n\n'''Ganymede:''' What about if you want to specifically\
      \ mark a path as being \"on foot\" only? Is there a bDontTakeVehicle property,\
      \ or a bOnlyWalking somewhere?\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
