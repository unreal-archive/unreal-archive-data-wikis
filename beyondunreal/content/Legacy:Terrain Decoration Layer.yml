      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Terrain Painting Tool is a bit buggy when it comes\
      \ to editing a decoration layer's alpha map. So here's a method to get around\
      \ it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before beginning, you should have a terrain created with\
      \ a visible base texture, such as a grass layer. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Creating_A_Terrain\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Creating A Terrain\">Creating A Terrain</a></li>\n<li>You now\
      \ need to create a <a href=\"/Legacy:Terrain_Texture_Layer\" title=\"Legacy:Terrain\
      \ Texture Layer\">Terrain Texture layer</a> with a density map for your deco\
      \ layer. First go to the <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Browser\" title=\"Legacy:Texture\
      \ Browser\">Texture Browser</a> and select some texture (it doesn't matter which,\
      \ we won't be looking at it.) Open the terrain editor and select your terrain,\
      \ then go to the <i>layers</i> tab and hit \"new\" to create a new texture layer.\
      \ Call it something like \"decolayer1alpha\" Once the layer has been created,\
      \ use the up arrow to move the layer to the bottom of the layer stack (to the\
      \ top of the list.) This will ensure that whatever texture you've selected will\
      \ not be drawn as a layer, but lets us edit the layer's alpha map which effectively\
      \ changes the density on the deco layer.<br />\nAlternatively, you could import\
      \ an 8-bit grayscale texture from an external application. However, this takes\
      \ more time, and you'll probably have to adjust this texture anyway to get the\
      \ decorations exactly how you want them.</li>\n<li>Select a static mesh in the\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh_Browser\" title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh Browser\"\
      >static mesh browser</a>. This is the mesh that will appear wherever the density\
      \ map is lighter.</li>\n<li>Go to the texture browser and select the \"decolayer1alpha\"\
      \ texture that you created in step 2. Now you're ready.</li>\n<li>Click in the\
      \ \"Decorations\" tab. Click \"New\". You should see a new row appear in the\
      \ list box, with three red Xs. This represents your decoration layer.</li>\n\
      <li>Right-click the row in the list -&gt; Set Density Texture from Current</li>\n\
      <li>Right-click the row in the list -&gt; Set static mesh from Current</li>\n\
      <li>Go back to <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Camera_Mode?redlink=1\" class=\"new\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Camera Mode (page does not exist)\">camera mode</a> in the\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Toolbox\" title=\"Legacy:Toolbox\">toolbox</a>, find your\
      \ TerrainInfo actor and <a href=\"/Legacy:Set_The_Following_Properties\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Set The Following Properties\">set the following properties</a>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>TerrainInfo -&gt; DecoLayers -&gt; [<i>your layer's number</i>] -&gt; FadeOutRadius\
      \ -&gt; Min = 500</li>\n<li>TerrainInfo -&gt; DecoLayers -&gt; [<i>your layer's\
      \ number</i>] -&gt; FadeOutRadius -&gt; Max = 1200 (These numbers are just examples\
      \ – you need to set the max higher than 0 so you can actually see the meshes\
      \ in the editor. More details below)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Now go back to\
      \ the terrain editor, go to the <i>layers</i> tab, select the layer which controls\
      \ the density map for your deco layer, and paint it as if you would paint a\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Terrain_Texture_Layer\" title=\"Legacy:Terrain Texture Layer\"\
      >Terrain Texture Layer</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Won't this add to\
      \ the texture complexity of the terrain? Should you delete the texture layer\
      \ before releasing the map?</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Editing\"\

      <p>As stated above, editing the density of the texture layer controlling the\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In addition to setting\
      \ the density map for the texture, you can also use a texture to control the\
      \ scale of individual meshes on your terrain, or a color map to change the tint\
      \ of static meshes in different areas. Perhaps you want to use a grass texture,\
      \ but you want certain areas to look like a bloody battlefield? this is the\
      \ way to do it. The color map simply takes whatever color the original mesh\
      \ looked like, and blends it with the color in the color map. This will be most\
      \ apparent if your static mesh had a texture that was close to white, but can\
      \ be used with any static mesh.</p>\n<p>To set a color map, select the texture\
      \ you want, then go to the terrain editor-&gt;decorations tab, right click the\
      \ deco layer, and select \"set color texture from current\"</p>\n<p>For the\
      \ scale map, the R,G,B values determine the scale in the X,Y,Z directions respectively.\
      \ This is probably easiest to do in a seperate image editor.</p>\n<p>To set\
      \ a scale map, select the texture you want, then go to the terrain editor-&gt;decorations\
      \ tab, right click the deco layer, and select \"set scale texture from current\"\

      <p><b>Enos Shenk:</b> Ive never had any trouble removing decorations. Just using\
      \ the painting tool with my layer linked to my decolayer and control+rightclick\
      \ un-paints them just like a texture layer.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I tried\
      \ that, and control+rightclick seems to apply meshes same as control-left. This\
      \ is UT2003 UnrealEd</p>\n<p><b>Lilguy:</b> Ok, pretty much did a total rewrite\
      \ on the how to section, and using that method, it should solve your problem\
      \ Tarquin.</p>\n<p><b>Lilguy:</b> Anything else someone would like to see here?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> I like your workaround of using a hidden texture layer. Is\
      \ the painting tool definitely b0rked for working on deco layers directly?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Lilguy:</b> Yeah I think that they never intended it to be used that way...When\
      \ I use the paint tool on a dec layer,it modifies the geometry...I'd like to\
      \ take credit for the idea of using texture layers, but that's how I learned\
      \ todo it in the 3Dbuzz vtm on terrain, and also how they do it on the udn site\
      \ for deco layers.</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> Works fine for me... make sure that\
      \ you've selected the decolayer before painting though. Btw, is there ANY way\
      \ of creating decolayers with collision? Making an entire forest without DecoLayers\
      \ <i>can</i> piss me off pretty much...&#160;:(</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> For\
      \ me, painting a deco layer works when ADDING stuff, but not removing it.&#160;:(</p>\n\
      <p><b>Lilguy:</b> strange, when I was playing with it yesterday, I couldn't\
      \ get it to add anything when I actually had the deco layer selected. In any\
      \ case, does using the texture layer method work for you? As far as collision,\
      \ I *think* that using a static mesh with collision built in should solve the\
      \ problem, but I could be wrong. I know in the official maps when they want\
      \ to put things like trees in a map, they always just place the tree manually.\
      \ I think deco layers are more indended for things like grass and things where\
      \ exact placement doesn't really matter.</p>\n<p><b>Otter:</b> Say you wanted\
      \ to have grass bend when you walk through it... is that possible using a terrain\
      \ deco layer?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> No, I don't believe it is. You would probrably\
      \ have to script custom grass actors.</p>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> No, not in any Unreal\
      \ Engine game. I know Hidden and Dangerous 2 has it (it looks very awesome,\
      \ very natural), but then again, it doesn't have an editor&#160;;)</p>\n<p><b>Otter:</b>\
      \ Ok then, how's this... animated meshes, ie grass that subtley blows in the\
      \ wind?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Static meshes can't animate</p>\n<p><b>Erdrik:</b>\
      \ I thought it might be important to note that the rangevector ScaleMultiplier\
      \ is not set to 1 by default.</p>\n<p>(at least not in my editor...) I had spent\
      \ an hour or so after following the above steps trying to figure out why my</p>\n\
      <p>deco's weren't working, eventually discovering that at a scale of 0 the certainly\
      \ wouldn't be visable.&#160;:P lol</p>\n<p>Aaack! If you saw it I apologies\
      \ for the horror I unleashed to this page I hope I fixed it... &lt;:(</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> If it is not set to 1 by default, then please correct the\
      \ information in the main body of the page.</p>\n<p><b>V3rt1go:</b> The VTMs\
      \ (if you believe them) say you should only paint on the layer under the layers\
      \ tab, and that painting on the deco layer itself can cause problems.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Citruspunch:</b> Can't see the grass? Ensure you've actually told unreal\
      \ to display foliage. I have a low spec system and couldn't figure out whiy\

      \ should have a terrain created with a visible base texture, such as a grass\
      \ layer. See [[Legacy:Creating A Terrain|Creating A Terrain]]\n# You now need\
      \ to create a [[Legacy:Terrain Texture Layer|Terrain Texture layer]] with a\
      \ density map for your deco layer. First go to the [[Legacy:Texture Browser|Texture\
      \ Browser]] and select some texture (it doesn't matter which, we won't be looking\
      \ at it.) Open the terrain editor and select your terrain, then go to the ''layers''\
      \ tab and hit \"new\" to create a new texture layer. Call it something like\
      \ \"decolayer1alpha\" Once the layer has been created, use the up arrow to move\
      \ the layer to the bottom of the layer stack (to the top of the list.) This\
      \ will ensure that whatever texture you've selected will not be drawn as a layer,\
      \ but lets us edit the layer's alpha map which effectively changes the density\
      \ on the deco layer.<br />Alternatively, you could import an 8-bit grayscale\
      \ texture from an external application. However, this takes more time, and you'll\
      \ probably have to adjust this texture anyway to get the decorations exactly\
      \ how you want them.\n# Select a static mesh in the [[Legacy:Static Mesh Browser|static\
      \ mesh browser]]. This is the mesh that will appear wherever the density map\
      \ is lighter. \n# Go to the texture browser and select the \"decolayer1alpha\"\
      \ texture that you created in step 2. Now you're ready.\n# Click in the \"Decorations\"\
      \ tab. Click \"New\". You should see a new row appear in the list box, with\
      \ three red Xs. This represents your decoration layer.\n# Right-click the row\
      \ in the list -> Set Density Texture from Current\n# Right-click the row in\
      \ the list -> Set static mesh from Current\n# Go back to [[Legacy:Camera Mode|camera\
      \ mode]] in the [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]], find your TerrainInfo actor and\
      \ [[Legacy:Set The Following Properties|set the following properties]]\n#* TerrainInfo\
      \ -> DecoLayers -> [''your layer's number''] -> FadeOutRadius -> Min = 500\n\
      #* TerrainInfo -> DecoLayers -> [''your layer's number''] -> FadeOutRadius ->\
      \ Max = 1200 (These numbers are just examples &ndash; you need to set the max\
      \ higher than 0 so you can actually see the meshes in the editor. More details\
      \ below)\n# Now go back to the terrain editor, go to the ''layers'' tab, select\
      \ the layer which controls the density map for your deco layer, and paint it\
      \ as if you would paint a [[Legacy:Terrain Texture Layer|Terrain Texture Layer]]\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' Won't this add to the texture complexity of the terrain? Should\
      \ you delete the texture layer before releasing the map?\n\n==Editing==\n\n\
      As stated above, editing the density of the texture layer controlling the deco\
      \ layer is exactly the same as using the \"paint\" tool on a [[Legacy:Terrain\
      \ Texture Layer|Terrain Texture Layer]] Select the layer (not the deco layer!)\
      \ and the paint tool Then use ctrl+lmb to make the deco layer more dense, and\
      \ ctrl+rmb to make the area less dense.\n\n==Changing color and scale of static\
      \ meshes==\n\nIn addition to setting the density map for the texture, you can\
      \ also use a texture to control the scale of individual meshes on your terrain,\
      \ or a color map to change the tint of static meshes in different areas. Perhaps\
      \ you want to use a grass texture, but you want certain areas to look like a\
      \ bloody battlefield? this is the way to do it. The color map simply takes whatever\
      \ color the original mesh looked like, and blends it with the color in the color\
      \ map. This will be most apparent if your static mesh had a texture that was\
      \ close to white, but can be used with any static mesh. \n\nTo set a color map,\
      \ select the texture you want, then go to the terrain editor->decorations tab,\
      \ right click the deco layer, and select \"set color texture from current\"\n\
      \nFor the scale map, the R,G,B values determine the scale in the X,Y,Z directions\
      \ respectively. This is probably easiest to do in a seperate image editor. \n\
      \nTo set a scale map, select the texture you want, then go to the terrain editor->decorations\
      \ tab, right click the deco layer, and select \"set scale texture from current\"\
      \n\n==Properties==\n\n; int AlignToTerrain :  If this is 0, then all the static\
      \ meshes will stand straight up. Otherwise, they'll stick out from the slope\
      \ of the terrain.\n; Texture ColorMap :  The optional color map which is streched\
      \ over the terrain to modify the color of individual static meshes in the deco\
      \ layer\n; Texture DensityMap :  The density map which controls how many static\
      \ meshes will be in one area\n; range DensityMultiplier :  this is a range which\
      \ you can use to tweak the density of the static meshes. Higher values will\
      \ make the layer more dense.\n; int DisregardTerrainLighting :  setting this\
      \ to a non-zero value will basically make all of the static meshes fully lit.\
      \ This could be useful, for instance, if you wanted it to look like you had\
      \ lots of little lights all over the ground...\n; ESortOrder DrawOrder :  This\
      \ tells the engine how to sort the meshes before it draws them. Using Sort_BackToFront\
      \ will probably give the results you want.\n; range FadeoutRadius :  This is\
      \ a range which determines how to fade out the deco layer with distance. Anything\
      \ less than the min distance value will be fully opaque, and anything greater\
      \ thean the max will be fully translucent. Everything in-between will be slowly\
      \ blended between the two. It's important to adjust this, along with the density\
      \ of your deco layer to get the best balance between performance and asthetics.\n\
      ; int LitDirectional :  Setting this to a non-zero value will make the individual\
      \ meshes use the level's sunlight, rather than just the light value on the terrain\
      \ at that point. Use this!\n; int MaxPerQuad :  The maximum number of meshes\
      \ in one quad on the terrain. Probably should be left alone for most purposes.\n\
      ; int RandomYaw :  Setting this to non-zero causes the meshes to have random\
      \ yaw rotations, for more of a natural organic feel.\n; Texture ScaleMap : \
      \ The optional scale map which determines the size of individual meshes on the\
      \ terrain. The R,G,B channels affect the X,Y,Z scales, so use a grayscale texture\
      \ if you want to scale everything uniformly.\n; rangevector ScaleMultiplier\
      \ :  This is useful for scaling all of the meshes on the layer. Actual scale\
      \ value will be a random value somewhere between the min and max. Everything\
      \ is set to 1 by default.\n; int Seed :  Changing this will generate a new random\
      \ placement for the meshes, while still obeying the guidelines set by the density\
      \ map.\n; int ShowOnInvisibleTerrain :  false by default, this allows you to\
      \ show the static meshes even where the terrain has been set to invisible.\n\
      ; int ShowOnTerrain :  obvious.\n; StaticMesh StaticMesh :  The static mesh\
      \ which is displayed by this deco layer.\n\n==Tips for creating deco layers==\n\
      * in the [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]] actor properties, there is a value\
      \ called \"DecoLayerOffset\". This is a global value for each terrain which\
      \ defines the height above the terrain to move the static meshes. Unfortunately\
      \ it affects all deco layers, but it can be useful if you're using a static\
      \ mesh that needs the height to be adjusted somewhat.\n* The unreal engine is\
      \ not very good about handling translucent objects, so beware that if you have\
      \ other translucent actors in your game, they may get overdrawn totally by deco\
      \ layers.\n* It's very important to find a good balance between performance\
      \ and looks. If you want more dense meshes, then try fading them out sooner.\
      \ If you want a more continuous look for something like a flight simulator,\
      \ consider using relatively sparse density maps, but let things fade away further\
      \ into the distance.\n* make sure if you're going for something like grass,\
      \ to turn on litdirectional and random yaw, as well as giving the ScaleMultiplier\
      \ a little room to mess with the scale. This will give your layer a much more\
      \ organic and natural look.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[udn2:CreatingDecoLayers]]\n\

      \n'''Enos Shenk:''' Ive never had any trouble removing decorations. Just using\
      \ the painting tool with my layer linked to my decolayer and control+rightclick\
      \ un-paints them just like a texture layer.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I tried that,\
      \ and control+rightclick seems to apply meshes same as control-left. This is\
      \ UT2003 UnrealEd\n\n'''Lilguy:''' Ok, pretty much did a total rewrite on the\
      \ how to section, and using that method, it should solve your problem Tarquin.\n\
      \n'''Lilguy:''' Anything else someone would like to see here?\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ I like your workaround of using a hidden texture layer. Is the painting tool\
      \ definitely b0rked for working on deco layers directly?\n\n'''Lilguy:''' Yeah\
      \ I think that they never intended it to be used that way...When I use the paint\
      \ tool on a dec layer,it modifies the geometry...I'd like to take credit for\
      \ the idea of using texture layers, but that's how I learned todo it in the\
      \ 3Dbuzz vtm on terrain, and also how they do it on the udn site for deco layers.\n\
      \n'''Legal:''' Works fine for me... make sure that you've selected the decolayer\
      \ before painting though. Btw, is there ANY way of creating decolayers with\
      \ collision? Making an entire forest without DecoLayers ''can'' piss me off\
      \ pretty much... :(\n\n'''Tarquin:''' For me, painting a deco layer works when\
      \ ADDING stuff, but not removing it. :(\n\n'''Lilguy:''' strange, when I was\
      \ playing with it yesterday, I couldn't get it to add anything when I actually\
      \ had the deco layer selected. In any case, does using the texture layer method\
      \ work for you? As far as collision, I *think* that using a static mesh with\
      \ collision built in should solve the problem, but I could be wrong. I know\
      \ in the official maps when they want to put things like trees in a map, they\
      \ always just place the tree manually. I think deco layers are more indended\
      \ for things like grass and things where exact placement doesn't really matter.\n\
      \n'''Otter:''' Say you wanted to have grass bend when you walk through it...\
      \ is that possible using a terrain deco layer?\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' No, I don't\
      \ believe it is. You would probrably have to script custom grass actors.\n\n\
      '''Legal:''' No, not in any Unreal Engine game. I know Hidden and Dangerous\
      \ 2 has it (it looks very awesome, very natural), but then again, it doesn't\
      \ have an editor ;)\n\n'''Otter:''' Ok then, how's this... animated meshes,\
      \ ie grass that subtley blows in the wind? \n\n'''Tarquin:''' Static meshes\
      \ can't animate\n\n'''Erdrik:''' I thought it might be important to note that\
      \ the rangevector ScaleMultiplier is not set to 1 by default. \n\n(at least\
      \ not in my editor...) I had spent an hour or so after following the above steps\
      \ trying to figure out why my \n\ndeco's weren't working, eventually discovering\
      \ that at a scale of 0 the certainly wouldn't be visable. :P lol\n\nAaack! If\
      \ you saw it I apologies for the horror I unleashed to this page I hope I fixed\
      \ it... <:(\n\n'''Tarquin:''' If it is not set to 1 by default, then please\
      \ correct the information in the main body of the page.\n\n'''V3rt1go:'''  The\
      \ VTMs (if you believe them) say you should only paint on the layer under the\
      \ layers tab, and that painting on the deco layer itself can cause problems.\n\
      \n'''Citruspunch:''' Can't see the grass? Ensure you've actually told unreal\
      \ to display foliage. I have a low spec system and couldn't figure out whiy\
      \ this wasn't showing up.\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
