      \ objects are drawn to the screen without erasing the previous frame. The most\
      \ common reason for this occurring in the Unreal Engine is a BSP hole, a transparent/translucent\

      \ that moves in front of the surface of the HOM will \"imprint\" on the HOM.\
      \ If you use the ghost cheat, the HOM will appear black because the ghost cheat\
      \ has the additional effect of drawing a black square behind all objects on\
      \ the screen, for the purpose of preventing HOM effects when inside a wall.</p>\n\
