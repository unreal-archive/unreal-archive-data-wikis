      \ a free-for-all gametype, like Deathmatch. When a player is killed, they respawn\
      \ as their killer's slave. Slaves have a ghost-like appearance and cannot receive\
      \ nor deal damage. When a slave picks up items, they are given to his master\
      \ and the slave earns \"favor.\" If a slave can earn 100 favor, he has \"earned\
      \ his freedom\" and respawns as a player again. Another way for a slave to earn\
      \ favor is by \"tagging\" enemy masters. Slaves can shoot a tagging orb by pressing\
      \ primary fire. Once a player has been tagged, the slave's master can easily\
      \ see the location of the tagged player. The objective is to enslave every other\
      \ player in the match. Release information and download link can be found at\
