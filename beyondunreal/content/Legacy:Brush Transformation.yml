      \ Yeah... I'd like to save some of my overview stuff, so I'll shove it down\
      \ here for now. But this thing is that brush transformations are completely\
      \ different under UEd 3. Rotations, at least, now transform immediately. I think\
      \ this is a step back in terms of usefulness; I have no idea why they've changed\
      \ it.</p>\n<p><b>Sobiwan:</b> Fair enough. I dont use UEd3, so I dont learn\
      \ about it and didnt know about it. That overview is one hell of a read though!\
      \ There is probably a way to losslessly compress the verbage. &#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>bmw5002:</b> UEd3 doesn't have the numerical brush scale property (or\
      \ im stupid)! Arrrg!</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> no, you're not stupid. They've\
      \ removed brush scaling. There's still a numeral scaling dialog somewhere, but\
      \ it's now an immediate transformation of vertex co-ordinates.</p>\n<p>{X-dArKwUn-X}\
      \ I thought it would be a cool idea to take a well known level, and jack-up\
      \ the total size, to make it look like your bug-sized, but every time I use\
      \ the scaler OR edit the MainScale/PostScale, all the brushes end up inside\
      \ eachother, creating hell and bsp holes galore. How do I do this?</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ To resize a map properly, you not only have to rescale the brushes (preferably\
      \ with an integer scaling factor or one that can be written as 1 divided once\
      \ or several times by 2 so everything stays on the grid) but also have to update\
      \ the brush positions accordingly.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Mapping\"\

      \ carried out on a <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush\" title=\"Legacy:Brush\">brush</a>.\
      \ Quick high-school geometry refresher: matrix transformations of 3D space can\
      \ be classified into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rotations</li>\n<li>scaling in 1, 2 or\
      \ 3 axes</li>\n<li>reflections, which are secretly a scaling of -1 in one axis</li>\n\
      <li>skews</li>\n</ul>\n<p>UnrealEd can perform all these operations on a brush\
      \ (though skewing is a little bizarre). The following actions are brush transformations:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Scaling with <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush_Scaling\" title=\"Legacy:Brush\
      \ Scaling\">Brush Scaling</a> mode</li>\n<li>Rotations with <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush_Rotate\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Brush Rotate\">Brush rotate</a> mode or <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Camera_Mode?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Camera Mode (page does not exist)\">camera mode</a></li>\n\
      <li>Reflections commands in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush_Context_Menu\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Brush Context Menu\">Brush Context Menu</a></li>\n<li>Brush sheer mode\
      \ (possibly)</li>\n<li>Numerical scaling in the Properties.Brush properties:\
      \ scale and sheer</li>\n<li>Numerical rotation in Properties.Movement.Rotation</li>\n\
      <li>simply moving a brush is in fact also (technically) a brush transformation</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>All of these changes to a brush do not change the actual co-ordinates\
      \ of the points that make up the wireframe. Here's a rough analogy: suppose\
      \ you're making a cartoon and animating a famous mouse. You have a cel with\
      \ Mickey on a background. Suppose you want to rotate the mouse for some reason:\
      \ you could erase the picture on the cel and redraw it at an angle. Or, you\
      \ could just rotate the sheet of celluloid.</p>\n<p>UnrealEd's brush transformations\
      \ are the same: they keep the wireframe fixed internally and apply numerical\
      \ transformations to the object that you see and the <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a> compiler processes. To extend the Mickey analogy,\
      \ the cel can also be stretched, flipped or skewed.</p>\n<p>The following properties\
      \ of the brush are involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MainScale &amp; PostScale (need\
      \ to figure out exaclty how these work)\n<ul>\n<li>Scale</li>\n<li>SheerAxis</li>\n\
      <li>SheerRate</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rotation</li>\n<li>Location</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>Each brush effectively has its own 'local' axes and co-ordinates. The upshot\
      \ is that this approach has advantages and disadvantages:</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ the brush's previous state perfectly. There's no possibility of round-off\

      \ moving a brush is in fact also (technically) a brush transformation\n\nAll\
      \ of these changes to a brush do not change the actual co-ordinates of the points\
      \ that make up the wireframe. Here's a rough analogy: suppose you're making\
      \ a cartoon and animating a famous mouse. You have a cel with Mickey on a background.\
      \ Suppose you want to rotate the mouse for some reason: you could erase the\
      \ picture on the cel and redraw it at an angle. Or, you could just rotate the\
      \ sheet of celluloid. \n\nUnrealEd's brush transformations are the same: they\
      \ keep the wireframe fixed internally and apply numerical transformations to\
      \ the object that you see and the [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]] compiler processes. To\
      \ extend the Mickey analogy, the cel can also be stretched, flipped or skewed.\n\
      \nThe following properties of the brush are involved:\n\n* MainScale & PostScale\
      \ (need to figure out exaclty how these work)\n** Scale\n** SheerAxis\n** SheerRate\n\
      * Rotation\n* Location\n\nEach brush effectively has its own 'local' axes and\
      \ co-ordinates. The upshot is that this approach has advantages and disadvantages:\n\
      \n===Advantages ===\n* undoing or reversing a transformation restores the brush's\
      \ previous state perfectly. There's no possibility of round-off errors, the\
      \ way that performing 1 / 3 * 3 on a calculator can give 0.999999.\n* it's easy\
      \ to determine the orientation of a brush, to then apply it other brushes when\
      \ making complex geometry\n\n===Disadvantages ===\n* combining transformations\
      \ can produce unexpected results, for example gimbal lock when rotating in several\
      \ axes, or when scaling and rotating\n* [[Legacy:Vertex Editing|vertex editing]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Brush Clipping|brush clipping]] can have unexpected results on\
      \ a scaled or rotated brush. \n\n==Transforming permanently ==\n\nThis command\
      \ in the [[Legacy:Brush Context Menu|Brush Context Menu]] resets all transformations\
      \ (except location) and keeps the brush shape the same by applying the transformation\
      \ calculations to the wireframe coordinates. The brush can then be clipped,\
      \ vertex-edited or have further transformations applied with impunity, but at\
      \ a cost: it's no longer possible to read off what transformations got it into\
      \ the current state.\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n[[Category:Legacy\
