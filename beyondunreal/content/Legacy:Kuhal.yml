      <p>My nick is borrowed from the much loved and highly absorbing works of fiction\
      \ written by <b>Julian May</b>.</p>\n<p>If you like Fantasy and love Science\
      \ Fiction and want a perfect example of the merging of these genres into a cohesive\
      \ and transfixing series, read these books!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>The Many Coloured\
      \ Land</i></li>\n<li><i>The Golden Torc</i></li>\n<li><i>The Non-Born King</i></li>\n\
      <li><i>The Adversary</i></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I identify with <i><b>Kuhal Earthshaker</b></i>\
      \ because he was always second best in what he did (ugh like me).</p>\n<p>He\
      \ lost a loved one and overcame terrible hardship to survive a very difficult\
      \ time in his world.</p>\n<p>However throughout all of the disasters and hardship,\
      \ Kuhal remained true to his ideals and was always honourable and noble.</p>\n\
      <p>This is an ideal I aspire to hence my adoption of the name Kuhal&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p>If you read the books, this \"spoiler\" won't matter at all as he is not\
      \ the focal character at all...</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kuhal_on_Family\"\

      \ about Australians who keep beating us in sports, and UnrealTournament&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p>The only wish I have is that there were more hours in a day so that I could\

      <p><b>Kuhal:</b> Err, thanks&#160;:) I chose the topic because I like UltraEdit\
      \ but also I wanted to learn the ropes as it were. I tried to keep the look\
      \ and feel as close to the standards I've been impressed with throughout the\
      \ Wiki...</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Your request for peer review kind of got snowed\
      \ under heavy Site Navigation discussion... Wiki peer review is a bit odd at\
      \ first, especially if you're coming from forums where people tend to post comments\
      \ straight away. On a wiki, the tendency is that complete silence in reaction\
      \ to something usually means that people like it. (or they don't get it yet\
      \ and are waiting to see what it grows into). It takes some getting used to.\
      \ I have the funny feeling that <a href=\"/Legacy:Application\" title=\"Legacy:Application\"\
      >Application</a> isn't the only page that gives a list of script editors to\
      \ use with UnrealScript... I'm not sure, but it might be an idea to track that\
      \ down &amp; put a link to <a href=\"/Legacy:UltraEdit\" title=\"Legacy:UltraEdit\"\

      \ the stories are cool. vi..lmao...Can you imagine modding unrealscript in vi\

    text: "==A bit about me... ==\n\nMy nick is borrowed from the much loved and highly\
      \ absorbing works of fiction written by '''Julian May'''.  \n\nIf you like Fantasy\
      \ and love Science Fiction and want a perfect example of the merging of these\
      \ genres into a cohesive and transfixing series, read these books!\n* ''The\
      \ Many Coloured Land''\n* ''The Golden Torc''\n* ''The Non-Born King''\n* ''The\
      \ Adversary''\n\nI identify with '''''Kuhal Earthshaker''''' because he was\
      \ always second best in what he did (ugh like me).  \n\nHe lost a loved one\
      \ and overcame terrible hardship to survive a very difficult time in his world.\
      \  \n\nHowever throughout all of the disasters and hardship, Kuhal remained\
      \ true to his ideals and was always honourable and noble.  \n\nThis is an ideal\
      \ I aspire to hence my adoption of the name Kuhal :)  \n\nIf you read the books,\
      \ this \"spoiler\" won't matter at all as he is not the focal character at all...\n\
      \n==Kuhal on Family ==\n\nMy family is my most important achievement and my\
      \ most important duty/love/activity.  \n\nI have two children; my son born in\
      \ January 2000 and my daughter born August 2001.  \n\nWe live in Auckland, New\
      \ Zealand which has a sub-tropical climate (although that's hard to picture\
      \ right now).  \n\nWe are famous for our scenery (Lord of the Rings fame most\
      \ recently), rugby, America's Cup, complaining about Australians who keep beating\
      \ us in sports, and UnrealTournament :)\n\nThe only wish I have is that there\
      \ were more hours in a day so that I could spend more than 1 hour a night on\
      \ my hobbies.  \n\nAfter the children are asleep and the chores are done, there\
      \ is precious little time to spend coding/playing/spamming and so on.  \n\n\
      Oh well, maybe in the next reality :)\n\n==Kuhal on Games ==\n* game = fun\n\
      * fun = good\n* game = good\n\nI'll play anything once and most things several\
      \ times (until I beat you perhaps :) ).  \n\nI'm into many types of games as\
      \ well as game formats.  \n\nIt comes from many a rainy day playing Monopoly\
      \ with my brothers and parents as I was growing up.  \n\nI was playing Chess\
      \ at 4 and beating Mum at 5 (or so I am told...).  \n\nI was taught many card\
      \ games as I was growing up as well as pool, darts (and other pub-related games).\
      \  \n\nI play hockey (that's Field Hockey to those in the USA) and Squash. \
      \ At school I captained the Squash and Chess teams and vice captained the hockey\
      \ team... \n\nWhy? Mainly because I'm pretty good and putting my point across\
      \ and leadership comes naturally :)\n\nThese days I play online games and very\
      \ little else.  Why? Because my children are my masters :)\n\n===Computer Games\
      \ ===\n\nI play:\n* '''UnrealTournament''' - (of course) - I have a little server\
      \ set up for our gaming clan but truthfully, it's there as my test bed for deploying\
      \ my mods...muahaha\n* '''WanCatan''' - its a network version of 'Settlers of\
      \ Catan' which is a fantastic board game by Klaus Teuber  visit Mayfair Games\
      \ at http://www.coolgames.com/ to learn more - incidentally, Klaus Teuber was\
      \ the creator of Monopoly as well!\n* '''Chess''' - visit http://itsyourmove.com\
      \ - many online http games there for when I'm at work behind the pesky firewall\n\
      * '''BroodWars''' - I used to be a big online player but I haven't played in\
      \ ages and ages - no times for a 4 hour marathon game these days...RTS's take\
      \ a back seat to turnbased or action games where I can leave and come back a\
      \ few minutes later\n\n===Board Games ===\n\nI play:\n* '''The Settlers of Catan'''\
      \ - \"Cities and Knights\" which is an extension of the original incorporating\
      \ more combative rules for those that like the extra challenge\n* '''Risk'''\
      \ - Haven't played in ages.  Rather a basic game but good fun in a group of\
      \ fanatics\n* '''Diplomacy''' - I love this game but no time to play and nobody\
      \ to play with.  Pure strategy, guile and negotiation skills.  No luck at all\n\
      * '''Cards''' - Various games like \"500\", \"Euchre\", \"Black Lady\" ...\n\
      \n==Kuhal on Programming ==\n* programming = fun\n* game = fun\n* programming\
      \ = game\n\n(false) Logic aside (hehe) programming to me is another type of\
      \ game.  \n\nThe rules are the language syntax.  \n\nThe skill is in your ability\
      \ to create new solutions.  \n\nAs with games, experience allows for better\
      \ success rates.  \n\nThe best game to play is one where it is you vs yourself,\
      \ trying for a personal best each time you play.  \n\nThis is what programming\
      \ is for me.  \n\nIt's also my livlihood but that's secondary.\n\n===Predominant\
      \ Languages ===\n\nThese are some of the languages I've needed to use to earn\
      \ a living over the years\n* Java/J2EE\n* Visual Basic (various forms)\n* [[Legacy:UnrealScript|UnrealScript]]\n\
      * LISP\n* Various Unix Shells\n* PHP\n* MySql (and SQl in general really)\n\n\
      ===Languages of interest ===\n\nAdditionally I've touched on these languages\
      \ for varying lengths of time for aspects of projects or just for interests\
      \ sake.\n\n* Perl\n* C/C++\n\n===Mod Pages ===\n\n[[Legacy:Mod Ideas/Balanced\
      \ CTF|Mod Ideas/Balanced CTF]]\n\n===Programming related interests ===\n\nSome\
      \ programming related interests of mine.  \n\nUnfortunately I've never had time\
      \ to follow any of them up farther than reading some theories and programming\
      \ techniques.\n* Artificial Intelligence (AI)\n* DirectX\n* Game Theory (related\
      \ to AI)\n\n==Kuhal on \"the things that make me MAD\" ==\n\nMY pet hates are:\n\
      * Unfairness\n** in games like UT when one team is stpacked with top talent\
      \ and nobody agrees to swap\n** in life when children (especially but not exclusively)\
      \ are hurt by evil people\n** whenever someone (ab)uses their power to hurt\
      \ others - grrrr\n\n* Abuse\n** verbal abuse of any sort I dislike - especially\
      \ online\n\n* Keyboards - they are so slow.  I want neural implants to allow\
      \ faster human/PC interaction!\n\n* Almond flavoured stuff (but I like eating\
      \ almonds - especially chocolate coated ones!)\n** agar - That stuff is just\
      \ nasty!\n** fondant icing - (spelling?) - that stuff that's on wedding cakes...yech\n\
      \n===Current Projects ===\n\n-September 2003-\n\nI've been inactive for a long\
      \ time as I lost interest in UT due to the local servers all going into disrepair.\
      \  Fortunately things are better now and I can enjoy playing some more.  I was\
      \ los tin the land of Warcraft 3 editing for a few months there and as much\
      \ fun as it was coming to terms with yet another scripting language, you don't\
      \ get as much satisfaction in WC3 scripting as in UT scripting :)\n\nI'm currently\
      \ adding to SemiAdmin for UT which is a mod started by [[Legacy:DarkByte|DarkByte]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Evolution|Evolution]].\n\n==Chalkboard ==\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Hello\
      \ Kuhal. Welcome to the Unreal Wiki. That's an impressive amount of work you've\
      \ put into [[Legacy:UltraEdit|UltraEdit]]!\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Hi, welcome\
      \ to the wiki! :) :tup:\n\n'''Kuhal:''' Err, thanks :)  I chose the topic because\
      \ I like UltraEdit but also I wanted to learn the ropes as it were.  I tried\
      \ to keep the look and feel as close to the standards I've been impressed with\
      \ throughout the Wiki...\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Your request for peer review kind\
      \ of got snowed under heavy Site Navigation discussion... Wiki peer review is\
      \ a bit odd at first, especially if you're coming from forums where people tend\
      \ to post comments straight away. On a wiki, the tendency is that complete silence\
      \ in reaction to something usually means that people like it. (or they don't\
      \ get it yet and are waiting to see what it grows into). It takes some getting\
      \ used to. I have the funny feeling that [[Legacy:Application|Application]]\
      \ isn't the only page that gives a list of script editors to use with UnrealScript...\
      \ I'm not sure, but it might be an idea to track that down & put a link to [[Legacy:UltraEdit|UltraEdit]]\
      \ there too. It's nice to hear standards impress! I regularly reel from how\
      \ disorganized this place is ... :D\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Hi Kuhal - I came\
      \ across those Julian May books many years ago - a storming set of stories.\
      \  O yeah - a very belated welcome to the Wiki.  Maybe I should add a section\
      \ on vi :)\n\n'''Kuhal:''' Thanks EntropicLqd and yeah the stories are cool.\
      \  vi..lmao...Can you imagine modding unrealscript in vi exclusively? OUCH!\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' It's been said so many times... but here goes for one more...\n\
      \nhttp://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/99may/uf000621.gif\n\n'''Kuhal:'''\
      \ ROFL.  It might be old but I haven't seen it before!  That's funny...especially\
      \ cos everyone knows that punch tape is the most hard core editor on the market!\
      \  Especially if you punch it with a compass during biology class... )\n\n'''Highlander:'''\
      \ Hey! I use gVim (version of VI for windows) to do my uscript. Has some nice\
      \ unrealscript highlighting.\n\n'''Kuhal:''' O...M...G!!!!!! I never thought\
      \ I would see the day :)  I use [[Legacy:UltraEdit|UltraEdit]].  I know the\
      \ minimum vi command necessary to cope with the small amount of unix scripting\
      \ I have to do from time to time...  \n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''  lol - that's a\
      \ great cartoon.  vi is OK once you've gone through the extreme trauma of having\
      \ to work with it.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' When I was doing my maths degree, they\
      \ tried to get us to learn vi to program in Fortran 77. I rebelled, and spend\
      \ 2 weeks solid learning to program TinyMUSH instead. Great fun, wreaked havoc\
      \ on my sleep pattern. Still that's what 1st year is for... :D (the department\
      \ were dragged kicking and screaming into the 20th century and switched to ''Mathematica''\
      \ the year after.)\n\n[[Category:Legacy Personal Page|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
