      <p>It's important to know that the PlayAnim and related functions don't get\
      \ replicated. This is where the real trouble starts. So you have yourself a\
      \ good animation offline, now how do you make it work online?</p>\n<p>The simple\
      \ solution is well documented and goes like this:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"\
      mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n\
      <pre class=\"de1\"><span class=\"co1\">//In your Pawn class</span>\n<span class=\"\
      kw1\">simulated</span> <span class=\"kw1\">event</span> SetAnimAction<span class=\"\
      br0\">(</span><span class=\"kw5\">name</span> NewAction<span class=\"br0\">)</span>\n\
      <span class=\"br0\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"co1\">//This is the default\
      \ animation replication method</span>\n    <span class=\"kw2\">if</span> <span\
      \ class=\"br0\">(</span>animaction <span class=\"sy0\">!=</span> NewAction<span\
      \ class=\"br0\">)</span> <span class=\"br0\">{</span>\n       <span class=\"\
      co1\">//This means that the animation played by the server is not the same as\
      \ by the client</span>\n \n       <span class=\"co1\">//Do some checks here\
      \ to see what animation should be played, and play it</span>\n    <span class=\"\
      br0\">}</span>\n<span class=\"br0\">}</span></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Now in\
      \ this function you will be doing basicly the stuff done by the server also,\
      \ for example:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\"\
      >\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"de1\"><span class=\"\
      co1\">//Somewhere in your code you do:</span>\n    <span class=\"kw4\">PlayAnim</span><span\
      \ class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"st0\">'myanim'</span>,,,<span class=\"\

      br0\">(</span><span class=\"nu0\">0</span>,<span class=\"nu0\">0</span><span\
      \ class=\"br0\">)</span>;</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>So the myanim animation you\
      \ need to be replicated. Now alter the SetAnimAction function to do this:</p>\n\
      <div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript\
      \ source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"de1\"><span class=\"co1\">//In your Pawn class</span>\n\

      \  <span class=\"co1\">//This means that the animation played by the server\

      >}</span>\n<span class=\"br0\">}</span></pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Well all nice\
      \ and perfect so far, but it wont work online just yet.</p>\n<p>First you need\
      \ to set the animaction variable to make it replicate and let the client see\
      \ that it needs to update. You do this by setting the AnimAction property of\
      \ your pawn to the animation you told the server to play:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\"\
      \ class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\"\

      \ properties to run smoothly with their environment. This is the hard part IMO.\
      \ I decided to use boolean and integers that got replicated, then the pawn's\
      \ Tick function would check the boolean and set the animation so it would use\
      \ the proper calculated properties etc.</p>\n<p>I am sure this part so far is\
      \ clear, this isn't the hard part of online animations.&#160;;)</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ my animation replication online I was shocked to see the pawn revert to default\

      \ the source of these animations. It turned out that a part of UT2003's engine\
      \ does animation control already. These where overruling my animations all the\
      \ time. A good way to solve this is by setting the Physics to PHYS_None, this\
      \ stops the engine from updating your pawn.</p>\n<p>Another part that overrules\
      \ the animations is the AnimEnd function. You can simply subclass it and make\

      \ into many problems with animations online, and after discovering many more\
      \ have these problems, I decided to write this little how to/tut so new people\
      \ can figure it out a bit more easy. I hope ;)\n\n==Basic Animation info==\n\
      \nThere are many ways to play animations, I guess most used are PlayAnim and\
      \ LoopAnim. Animations are blended over different channels etc.\n\nI am sure\

      \ functions don't get replicated. This is where the real trouble starts. So\
      \ you have yourself a good animation offline, now how do you make it work online?\n\
      \nThe simple solution is well documented and goes like this:\n\n<uscript>\n\
      //In your Pawn class\nsimulated event SetAnimAction(name NewAction)\n{\n   \
      \ //This is the default animation replication method\n    if (animaction !=\

      \ is not the same as by the client\n       if (animaction == 'myanim') {\n \
      \         PlayAnim(animaction,,,0);\n          FreezeAnimAt(0,0);\n    }\n}\n\
