      \ features and fixes for the trials community, here's some of them.</p>\n<dl>\n\
      <dd><b>Pawn Related</b>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Animation fixes</b><sup>.:..:</sup> i.e.\
      \ all animations are now played on the client side as well some gibbing fixes.</dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Fading Skins</b><sup>.:..:</sup>, other pawns that are near this Pawn\
      \ will be fading depending on the distance.</dd>\n<dd><b>Mover glitch fix</b><sup>.:..:,\
      \ Eliot</sup> i.e. forces a suicide if a player is detected to be inside a mover(this\
      \ was abused by players to glitch through doors blocking levels in trial maps).</dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Custom Suicide Message</b><sup>Eliot, .:..:</sup>, the ability to set\
      \ your own suicide message by using the console command <b>SetSuicideMessage</b>\
      \ <i>%o OMFG packetloss!.</i> a <b>GetCurrentSuicideMsg</b> command is also\
      \ available to copy your current suicide message to the clipboard.</dd>\n<dd><b>Custom\
      \ Drowning Damage</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, the ability to change the damage of drowning\
      \ to none or less/more.</dd>\n<dd>'<b>Anti-TeamKilling</b><sup>Eliot</sup>,\
      \ players could teamkill by shooting a grenade(etc) aimed to a team mate and\
      \ then switch from team which will make the fired projectile harmful to the\
      \ team mate, this is fixed by canceling the fire state of player before he switches\
      \ the team, also all inventory classes and all remaining projectiles that belong\
      \ to the player are destroyed!.</dd>\n<dd>'<b>Anti-MultiDodge hacks</b><sup>Eliot</sup>,\
      \ players were able to use MD hacks to dodge multiple times while in air to\
      \ cheat trial maps as well dodge with no delay, this has been fixed by putting\
      \ a server side check on <i>DoubleClickDir</i> and implementing a server side\
      \ delay time(false positives are possible, especially with higher ping).</dd>\n\
      <dd>'<b>Landing sound fix</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, sometimes the landing sound of\
      \ players wasn't played at all, this is now fixed though if the surface doesn't\
      \ have a sound applied it is possible to not hear any landing sound which is\
      \ quite annoying for trial players when they are trying to time their dodges\
      \ perfectly.</dd>\n<dd>'<b>SJ and the SWD shieldjump combination</b><sup>Eliot</sup>\
      \ used to overwrite the cool animations of characters after doing like Shield\
      \ Fire + Jump at the same this is because the damage animation was overwriting\
      \ the cool animation, this is fixed by disabling the damage animation(it was\
      \ kinda ugly anyway), this can be undone by using the console command <b>TogglePlayDirectionalHit</b>.</dd>\n\
      <dd>'<b>Default Weapon</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, the pawn class also tries to make\
      \ the <b>ShieldGun</b> weapon to be default selected weapon, by default the\
      \ <b>AssaultRifle</b> is selected by some code implement inside the gun(online\
      \ only), however sometimes(depending on ping) the <i>ShieldGun</i> is selected\
      \ and because people usually want the <i>ShieldGun</i> being the default selected\
      \ weapon, it got really annoying as it slows down your speedrun, to fix this\
      \ the Pawn class tries to make the <i>ShieldGun</i> to be always the default\
      \ selected weapon however this feature does not work perfectly(ping depend)\
      \ but still increases the chance.</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n<dd><b>ShieldGun Related</b>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd><b>Customize the ShieldGun's Color</b><sup>.:..:, Eliot</sup>, the\
      \ color of the <b>ShieldGun</b> skin(green) can be set by using the console\
      \ command <b>SetShieldColor</b> <i>(R=255,G=255,B=255,A=255)</i> i.e. white,\
      \ an options menu is also available to customize the color by using sliders,\
      \ to access this use <b>ShieldMenu</b>, <b>ShieldGunMenu</b>, <b>MNAFMenu</b>\
      \ or <b>SGMenu</b>.</dd>\n<dd><b>Auto-Fire fix</b><sup>.:..:, Eliot</sup>, when\
      \ charging with the original <i>ShieldGun</i> and if an team mate comes very\
      \ close to you then the <i>ShieldGun</i> would automatic release and so thus\
      \ ruining your speedrun especially when a room is very crowed, this is fixed\
      \ by making the automatic feature to only work against non-team mates.</dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Reflection Sound fix</b><sup>Eliot</sup>, the original <i>ShieldGun</i>\
      \ plays a sound whenever reflection is triggered(Alt-Fire) however this sound\
      \ does not work online, this is fixed.</dd>\n<dd><b>Alt-Fire Sound fix</b><sup>Eliot</sup>,\
      \ the original <i>ShieldGun</i> was meant to play a sound when the shield(Alt-Fire)\
      \ was activate, this is fixed now offline and online.</dd>\n<dd><b>Fire Timing</b><sup>Eliot</sup>,\
      \ the <i>MNAF</i> <i>ShieldGun</i> adds two new features to time firing, 1.\
      \ the crosshair color is gold when the <i>ShieldGun</i> is ready to be fired,\
      \ white if not, 2. if the aimed target is hittable then the crosshair color\
      \ alpha will be 255, 70% less if not, this can be toggled by using the console\
      \ command <i>ToggleCrosshairColor</i>.</dd>\n<dd><b>Alt-Fire Shield in Third-Person\
      \ improvement</b><sup>.:..:</sup>, the original <i>ShieldGun</i> shield rotation\
      \ is only attached to the pawn's rotation, the <i>MNAF</i> <i>ShieldGun</i>\
      \ improves this by making the shield more accurate to the <i>ShieldGun</i> location\
      \ and rotation, improving the feel of playing with the <i>ShieldGun</i> in third-person.</dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Primary-Fire Charging in Third-Person</b><sup>.:..:</sup>, the original\
      \ charging effect is not visible to other players, this is fixed and now all\
      \ players can see that you are charging the <i>ShieldGun</i>.</dd>\n<dd><b>Misc</b>,\
      \ there are several more small fixes and improvements done to the <i>ShieldGun</i>,\
      \ such as the firing sound pitch/volume is adjusted to make the <i>ShieldGun</i>\
      \ feel more powerful for its momentum, the net priority and update frequency\
      \ is also adjusted so that the <i>ShieldGun</i> is updated more and feels better\
      \ online especially for people with high ping.</dd>\n</dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2><span\

    text: "'''MutNoAutoFire''' is a mutator developed for Assault Trials since 2006\
      \ by '''Eliot''' and '''.:..:'''.\n\nMutNoAutoFire adds a lot of new features\
      \ to the game for players to use as well fixes many bugs in the game that were\
      \ annoying in trials but the main purpose was to fix the auto-firing of ShieldGuns\
      \ whenever the owner of the gun went to close to a teammate which was really\
      \ annoying when a server is overpopulated.\n\n==Features==\n'''Features/Fixes'''\
      \ ''MNAF'' provides a lot of features and fixes for the trials community, here's\
      \ some of them.\n:'''Pawn Related'''\n::'''Animation fixes'''<sup>.:..:</sup>\
      \ i.e. all animations are now played on the client side as well some gibbing\
      \ fixes.\n::'''Fading Skins'''<sup>.:..:</sup>, other pawns that are near this\
      \ Pawn will be fading depending on the distance.\n::'''Mover glitch fix'''<sup>.:..:,\
      \ Eliot</sup> i.e. forces a suicide if a player is detected to be inside a mover(this\
      \ was abused by players to glitch through doors blocking levels in trial maps).\n\
      ::'''Custom Suicide Message'''<sup>Eliot, .:..:</sup>, the ability to set your\
      \ own suicide message by using the console command '''SetSuicideMessage''' ''%o\
      \ OMFG packetloss!.'' a '''GetCurrentSuicideMsg''' command is also available\
      \ to copy your current suicide message to the clipboard.\n::'''Custom Drowning\
      \ Damage'''<sup>Eliot</sup>, the ability to change the damage of drowning to\
      \ none or less/more.\n::''''Anti-TeamKilling'''<sup>Eliot</sup>, players could\
      \ teamkill by shooting a grenade(etc) aimed to a team mate and then switch from\
      \ team which will make the fired projectile harmful to the team mate, this is\
      \ fixed by canceling the fire state of player before he switches the team, also\
      \ all inventory classes and all remaining projectiles that belong to the player\
      \ are destroyed!.\n::''''Anti-MultiDodge hacks'''<sup>Eliot</sup>, players were\
      \ able to use MD hacks to dodge multiple times while in air to cheat trial maps\
      \ as well dodge with no delay, this has been fixed by putting a server side\
      \ check on ''DoubleClickDir'' and implementing a server side delay time(false\
      \ positives are possible, especially with higher ping).\n::''''Landing sound\
      \ fix'''<sup>Eliot</sup>, sometimes the landing sound of players wasn't played\
      \ at all, this is now fixed though if the surface doesn't have a sound applied\
      \ it is possible to not hear any landing sound which is quite annoying for trial\
      \ players when they are trying to time their dodges perfectly.\n::''''SJ and\
      \ the SWD shieldjump combination'''<sup>Eliot</sup> used to overwrite the cool\
      \ animations of characters after doing like Shield Fire + Jump at the same this\
      \ is because the damage animation was overwriting the cool animation, this is\
      \ fixed by disabling the damage animation(it was kinda ugly anyway), this can\
      \ be undone by using the console command '''TogglePlayDirectionalHit'''.\n::''''Default\
      \ Weapon'''<sup>Eliot</sup>, the pawn class also tries to make the '''ShieldGun'''\
      \ weapon to be default selected weapon, by default the '''AssaultRifle''' is\
      \ selected by some code implement inside the gun(online only), however sometimes(depending\
      \ on ping) the ''ShieldGun'' is selected and because people usually want the\
      \ ''ShieldGun'' being the default selected weapon, it got really annoying as\
      \ it slows down your speedrun, to fix this the Pawn class tries to make the\
      \ ''ShieldGun'' to be always the default selected weapon however this feature\
      \ does not work perfectly(ping depend) but still increases the chance.\n:'''ShieldGun\
      \ Related'''\n::'''Customize the ShieldGun's Color'''<sup>.:..:, Eliot</sup>,\
      \ the color of the '''ShieldGun''' skin(green) can be set by using the console\
      \ command '''SetShieldColor''' ''(R=255,G=255,B=255,A=255)'' i.e. white, an\
      \ options menu is also available to customize the color by using sliders, to\
      \ access this use '''ShieldMenu''', '''ShieldGunMenu''', '''MNAFMenu''' or '''SGMenu'''.\n\
      ::'''Auto-Fire fix'''<sup>.:..:, Eliot</sup>, when charging with the original\
      \ ''ShieldGun'' and if an team mate comes very close to you then the ''ShieldGun''\
      \ would automatic release and so thus ruining your speedrun especially when\
      \ a room is very crowed, this is fixed by making the automatic feature to only\
      \ work against non-team mates.\n::'''Reflection Sound fix'''<sup>Eliot</sup>,\
      \ the original ''ShieldGun'' plays a sound whenever reflection is triggered(Alt-Fire)\
      \ however this sound does not work online, this is fixed.\n::'''Alt-Fire Sound\
      \ fix'''<sup>Eliot</sup>, the original ''ShieldGun'' was meant to play a sound\
      \ when the shield(Alt-Fire) was activate, this is fixed now offline and online.\
      \ \n::'''Fire Timing'''<sup>Eliot</sup>, the ''MNAF'' ''ShieldGun'' adds two\
      \ new features to time firing, 1. the crosshair color is gold when the ''ShieldGun''\
      \ is ready to be fired, white if not, 2. if the aimed target is hittable then\
      \ the crosshair color alpha will be 255, 70% less if not, this can be toggled\
      \ by using the console command ''ToggleCrosshairColor''.\n::'''Alt-Fire Shield\
      \ in Third-Person improvement'''<sup>.:..:</sup>, the original ''ShieldGun''\
      \ shield rotation is only attached to the pawn's rotation, the ''MNAF'' ''ShieldGun''\
      \ improves this by making the shield more accurate to the ''ShieldGun'' location\
      \ and rotation, improving the feel of playing with the ''ShieldGun'' in third-person.\n\
      ::'''Primary-Fire Charging in Third-Person'''<sup>.:..:</sup>, the original\
      \ charging effect is not visible to other players, this is fixed and now all\
      \ players can see that you are charging the ''ShieldGun''.\n::'''Misc''', there\
      \ are several more small fixes and improvements done to the ''ShieldGun'', such\
      \ as the firing sound pitch/volume is adjusted to make the ''ShieldGun'' feel\
      \ more powerful for its momentum, the net priority and update frequency is also\
      \ adjusted so that the ''ShieldGun'' is updated more and feels better online\
      \ especially for people with high ping.\n\n==Console Commands==\n===ShieldGun\
      \ Commands===\nYou need to be holding a {{classgames|ShieldGun}} to use these\
      \ console commands.\n\n'''SetShieldColor''' - Set a new color for your ShieldGun\
      \ this is applied to the Skin, Muzzle and Shield etc.\n:#'''''[[optional]] [[Color]]'''''\

      \ a red colored ShieldGun .\n\n'''ShieldMenu''' - Opens the ShieldGunMenu where\
      \ you can config the ShieldGunColor with sliders etc.\n\n'''ToggleCrosshairColor'''\
      \ - By default the crosshair color of the ShieldGun is dynamic adjusted i.e.\
      \ When you aim to the ground and the ShieldGun fire is able to hit the ground\
      \ then the alpha of the crosshair color will be fully applied, When you have\
      \ fired the color of the gun will as well be changed to indicate you cannot\
      \ fire yet, the color will return to default whenever your ready to fire again.\
      \ Use this command to disable/enable this feature.  \n\n===Player Commands===\n\
