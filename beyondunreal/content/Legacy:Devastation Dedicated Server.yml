      <p>For those of you who are used to running up servers based on the Unreal engine\
      \ (see <a href=\"/Legacy:Running_A_Dedicated_Server_With_UCC\" title=\"Legacy:Running\
      \ A Dedicated Server With UCC\">Running A Dedicated Server With UCC</a>) you'll\
      \ find a couple of differences that may throw you slightly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The\
      \ INI files are not held within the <i>Devastation/System</i> directory. Instead\
      \ they are held in a directory under your \"My Documents\" folder. The advantage\
      \ to this is that if you have multiple users on a single PC they can all have\
      \ different key configurations. The disadvantage is that if you forget you'll\
      \ be left looking in the <i>Devastation/System</i> directory wondering where\
      \ the hell your configuration information went.</li>\n<li>The <i>ucc server</i>\
      \ notation is not the preferred way to start the dedicated server although it\
      \ still works fine. Instead <i>devastation.exe -server</i> is used. The latter\
      \ form runs the server as a windows tray icon. Right clicking on this icon provides\
      \ access to a server console and other information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>NOTE:</b>\
      \ The unpatched retail release (pre version 380) and MP demo currently have\
      \ some known scaling problems with the server code. The server code will not\
      \ scale to more than around 10-12 players. Digitalo are working on a patch for\
      \ this but until then try and keep the number of players to 10.</p>\n<dl>\n\
      <dd><b>Digitalo:</b> Yes, we are working on this.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>NOTE:</b>\
      \ Much of the information contained within this page applies also to the Devastation\
      \ MP demo. If something doesn't work on the MP Demo then the function is most\
      \ likely only available in the retail version.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Configuring the Server\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are two main ways of getting configuration information\
      \ into the server. One is via the command line used to start the server and\
      \ the other is within the INI file the server will use. This guide will use\
      \ the INI method as it seems to be better supported within the game. This set\
      \ up guide will assume that the following command has been run to create a \"\
      clean\" ini file from which to ammend the server settings.</p>\n<pre> devastation.exe\
      \ -server ini=devsvr.ini log=devsvr.log\n</pre>\n<p>After running the above\
      \ command you will see the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A devastation server\
      \ icon in your system tray. This is the server process itself.</li>\n<li>A new\
      \ file called devsvr.ini within <i>My Documents/Devastation</i>. This is the\
      \ INI file that will be used by the server to obtain it's configuration information.</li>\n\
      <li>A new file called devsvr.log within <i>My Documents/Devastation</i>. This\
      \ is the log file the server records. If you server crashes then this file may\
      \ contain useful information that will help track down the cause of the problem.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>Shut that server down by right-clicking on it and selecting the <i>Exit\
      \ server</i> option. By default it will be running the \"Entry\" map. No-one\
      \ can actually join that map so it's not that useful. However, we now have an\
      \ INI file that we can modify.</p>\n<p><b>NOTE:</b> Please see the Linux section\
      \ below for differences on that operating system.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A server running on the default port of 7777 will\
      \ send and receive UDP messagess on the following ports: 7777, 7778, 8777, 10777.</p>\n\
      <p>The first two ports listed above (7777, 7778) change as the main server port\
      \ is changed. 7777 becomes <i>port</i> and 7778 becomes <i>port + 1</i>. So,\
      \ if a server was started on port 6000 then the following ports would be used:\
      \ 6000, 6001, 8777, 10777.</p>\n<p>You can determine the ports your server is\
      \ using by performing the following steps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open up a command\
      \ line prompt</li>\n<li>Run the command <i>netstat -a</i></li>\n<li>Start the\
      \ devastation server passing in the port you wish to run the server on and the\
      \ ini file you wish to use.</li>\n<li>Run the command <i>netstat -a</i> again.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>The ports listed after the second netstat command that are not listed\
      \ after the first netstat command are those required by your server.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ start a CTF map with a 10 cap limit and a 60 minute timeout listening on port\
      \ 8777 using our own devsvr ini and log files the following command would be\
      \ entered.</p>\n<pre> devastation CTF-Union?caplimit=10?timeout=60 -server port=8777\
      \ ini=devsvr.ini log=devsvr.log\n</pre>\n<p>Note that the original <i>ucc server</i>\
      \ command also works for starting a server. Some people have reported a slight\
      \ improvement in server performance when using this syntax over running the\
      \ server via devastation.exe. An example is shown below:</p>\n<pre> ucc server\
      \ CTF-Union?caplimit=10?timeout=60 port=8777 ini=devsvr.ini log=devsvr.log\n\
      </pre>\n<p>Rather than run as a tray icon this will run the server up in a shell\

      <dd>The game type of the map. Valid values for the demo are <i>DTerritories.DCTFGameInfo</i>,\
      \ and <i>DGamePlay.DTeamStreetWarGI</i>. The maps shipped with the demo seem\
      \ to have the gametype set within the map so this parameter may not be required.</dd>\n\
      <dt>timelimit&#160;</dt>\n<dd>The number of minutes the map will run for. Be\
      \ aware that if you set both the time limit and the score limit (frag limit\
      \ or cap limit) both to zero then the game will automatically set a 20 minute\
      \ time out rather than start a server that will play a single map forever. This\
      \ behaviour is explicity coded into the game. <i>Is there an \"extra time\"\
      \ function for CTF games and the like?</i></dd>\n<dt>fraglimit&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>The number of frags required to win the game. In CTF games this parameter\
      \ can also be used to set the cap limit. Be aware that if you set both the time\
      \ limit and the score limit (frag limit or cap limit) both to zero then the\
      \ game will automatically set a 20 minute time out rather than start a server\
      \ that will play a single map forever. This behaviour is explicity coded into\
      \ the game.</dd>\n<dt>caplimit&#160;</dt>\n<dd>The number of flag captures required\
      \ to win the game. This parameter will take precedence over any value passed\
      \ in using the fraglimit parameter. Be aware that if you set both the time limit\
      \ and the score limit (frag limit or cap limit) both to zero then the game will\
      \ automatically set a 20 minute time out rather than start a server that will\

      \ the map changes. This value is not supported in the MP Demo.</dd>\n<dt>roundtimelimit&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>This specifies the amount of time in minutes that each Territories round\

      \ of time in seconds that any \"sudden death\" period can last before a draw\
      \ is declared.</dd>\n<dt>KarmaMP&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Can be set to True (or 1) to\
      \ enable Karma Physics in multiplayer. <b>Do not</b> do this unless your server\
      \ is an absoloute beast of a machine and everyone has LAN connections. The default\
      \ value is False (0). Players will not be able to move objects unless this is\
      \ set.</dd>\n<dt>GameMode&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This parameter can be used to place\
      \ the game in arcade mode or simulation mode. A value of \"arcade\" <i>or</i>\
      \ 0 will put the game into arcade mode. A value of \"simulation\" <i>or</i>\
      \ 1 will put the game into simulation mode. Players are able to pick up and\
      \ throw objects in either game mode as long as <i>KarmaMP</i> is enabled.</dd>\n\
      <dt>PktLoss&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Can be used to simulate an amount of packet loss.\
      \ Values can range from 0 to&#160;??. Mostly useful for development.</dd>\n\

      \ I assume that the server command is entered into the command prompt? If this\

      \ a program/cannot be found etc...\"</p>\n<p>If it isnt in the command prompt\
      \ could you please tell me where?</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> I'm not familiar\
      \ with the Devestation Dedicated server system, but in UT200X, when you start\
      \ a dedicated server, there is usually a little console that looks similar to\
      \ the log file (that shows up when you type 'showlog' in the ingame console.)\
      \ It should say Devestation Server on it or something. There should also be\
      \ a place at the bottom for you to type in server specific commands.</p>\n<p><b>Ragdoll:</b>\
      \ The problem is, the master devastation server has gone so you cannot start\
      \ a server from within the multiplayer as you would normally. There is a external\
      \ program called the all seeing eye that is used to connect to servers that\
      \ have already been set up(more info on the eye at <a href=\"/Legacy:Devastation\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Devastation\">Devastation</a> Home page, look for the link).\
      \ I should have mentioned that earlier, but does the eye mean i have to configure\
      \ anything differently?</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> It shouldn't do. Whenever\
      \ I set up a Devastation server I always used the ucc server route rather than\
      \ the game itself to do it. I don't have Devastation installed anymore so I\
      \ can't check. You will need to be in the /devastation/system directory to run\
      \ the server up if you want to do it from the command prompt. Failing that,\
      \ you can setup a windows short cut. Make the starting directory the /devastation/system\
      \ directory and add the command line switches to the shortcut. The ASE server\
      \ should already be configured within the INI file so the server should automatically\
      \ register there.</p>\n<p><b>Ragdoll:</b>Perhaps i should try to explain my\
      \ situation a bit clearer. I have not sucessfully started the server yet, i\
      \ am trying to enter the \"devastation.exe -server\" command to actually start\
      \ running the server. I am confused over where this commnad is entered.</p>\n\

  wikitext:
    text: "==Some Suprises ==\n\nFor those of you who are used to running up servers\
      \ based on the Unreal engine (see [[Legacy:Running A Dedicated Server With UCC|Running\
      \ A Dedicated Server With UCC]]) you'll find a couple of differences that may\
      \ throw you slightly.\n* The INI files are not held within the ''Devastation/System''\
      \ directory.  Instead they are held in a directory under your \"My Documents\"\
      \ folder.  The advantage to this is that if you have multiple users on a single\
      \ PC they can all have different key configurations.  The disadvantage is that\
      \ if you forget you'll be left looking in the ''Devastation/System'' directory\
      \ wondering where the hell your configuration information went.\n* The ''ucc\
      \ server'' notation is not the preferred way to start the dedicated server although\
      \ it still works fine.  Instead ''devastation.exe -server'' is used.  The latter\
      \ form runs the server as a windows tray icon.  Right clicking on this icon\
      \ provides access to a server console and other information.\n\n'''NOTE:'''\
      \  The unpatched retail release (pre version 380) and MP demo currently have\
      \ some known scaling problems with the server code.  The server code will not\
      \ scale to more than around 10-12 players.  Digitalo are working on a patch\
      \ for this but until then try and keep the number of players to 10.\n:'''Digitalo:'''\
      \ Yes, we are working on this.\n\n'''NOTE:''' Much of the information contained\
      \ within this page applies also to the Devastation MP demo.  If something doesn't\
      \ work on the MP Demo then the function is most likely only available in the\
      \ retail version.\n\n==Configuring the Server ==\n\nThere are two main ways\
      \ of getting configuration information into the server.  One is via the command\
      \ line used to start the server and the other is within the INI file the server\
      \ will use.  This guide will use the INI method as it seems to be better supported\
      \ within the game.  This set up guide will assume that the following command\
      \ has been run to create a \"clean\" ini file from which to ammend the server\
      \ settings.\n\n  devastation.exe -server ini=devsvr.ini log=devsvr.log\n\nAfter\
      \ running the above command you will see the following things:\n* A devastation\
      \ server icon in your system tray.  This is the server process itself.\n* A\
      \ new file called devsvr.ini within ''My Documents/Devastation''.  This is the\
      \ INI file that will be used by the server to obtain it's configuration information.\n\
      * A new file called devsvr.log within ''My Documents/Devastation''.  This is\
      \ the log file the server records.  If you server crashes then this file may\
      \ contain useful information that will help track down the cause of the problem.\n\
      \nShut that server down by right-clicking on it and selecting the ''Exit server''\
      \ option.  By default it will be running the \"Entry\" map.  No-one can actually\
      \ join that map so it's not that useful.  However, we now have an INI file that\
      \ we can modify.\n\n'''NOTE:''' Please see the Linux section below for differences\
      \ on that operating system.\n\n===Game Ports ===\n\nA server running on the\
      \ default port of 7777 will send and receive UDP messagess on the following\
      \ ports: 7777, 7778, 8777, 10777.\n\nThe first two ports listed above (7777,\
      \ 7778) change as the main server port is changed.   7777 becomes ''port'' and\
      \ 7778 becomes ''port + 1''.  So, if a server was started on port 6000 then\
      \ the following ports would be used: 6000, 6001, 8777, 10777.\n\nYou can determine\
      \ the ports your server is using by performing the following steps.\n* Open\
      \ up a command line prompt\n* Run the command ''netstat -a'' \n* Start the devastation\
      \ server passing in the port you wish to run the server on and the ini file\
      \ you wish to use.\n* Run the command ''netstat -a'' again.\n\nThe ports listed\
      \ after the second netstat command that are not listed after the first netstat\
      \ command are those required by your server.\n\n===Starting the Server ===\n\
      \nThe following is the general format for starting a server:\n\n  devastation.exe\
      \ ''map name?parameters'' -server port=''listening port'' ini=''ini filename''\
      \ log=''log filename''\n\nSo to start a CTF map with a 10 cap limit and a 60\
      \ minute timeout listening on port 8777 using our own devsvr ini and log files\
      \ the following command would be entered.\n\n  devastation CTF-Union?caplimit=10?timeout=60\
      \ -server port=8777 ini=devsvr.ini log=devsvr.log\n\nNote that the original\
      \ ''ucc server'' command also works for starting a server.  Some people have\
      \ reported a slight improvement in server performance when using this syntax\
      \ over running the server via devastation.exe.  An example is shown below:\n\
      \n  ucc server CTF-Union?caplimit=10?timeout=60 port=8777 ini=devsvr.ini log=devsvr.log\n\
      \nRather than run as a tray icon this will run the server up in a shell window.\n\
      \n===Game Parameters ===\n\nThe following parameters can be used either as part\
      \ of the command line or as part of the ''MapParams[n]'' line in the INI file\
      \ (described below).  All parameters are ? separated.\n\n; game : The game type\
      \ of the map.  Valid values for the demo are ''DTerritories.DCTFGameInfo'',\
      \ and ''DGamePlay.DTeamStreetWarGI''.  The maps shipped with the demo seem to\
      \ have the gametype set within the map so this parameter may not be required.\n\
      ; timelimit : The number of minutes the map will run for.  Be aware that if\
      \ you set both the time limit and the score limit (frag limit or cap limit)\
      \ both to zero then the game will automatically set a 20 minute time out rather\
      \ than start a server that will play a single map forever.  This behaviour is\
      \ explicity coded into the game. ''Is there an \"extra time\" function for CTF\
      \ games and the like?''\n; fraglimit : The number of frags required to win the\
      \ game.  In CTF games this parameter can also be used to set the cap limit.\
      \  Be aware that if you set both the time limit and the score limit (frag limit\
      \ or cap limit) both to zero then the game will automatically set a 20 minute\
      \ time out rather than start a server that will play a single map forever. \
      \ This behaviour is explicity coded into the game.\n; caplimit : The number\
      \ of flag captures required to win the game.  This parameter will take precedence\
      \ over any value passed in using the fraglimit parameter.  Be aware that if\
      \ you set both the time limit and the score limit (frag limit or cap limit)\
      \ both to zero then the game will automatically set a 20 minute time out rather\
      \ than start a server that will play a single map forever.  This behaviour is\
      \ explicity coded into the game.\n; roundlimit :  Allows the number of Territories\
      \ rounds to be specified.  This value determines the number of times a map is\
      \ played before the map changes.  This value is not supported in the MP Demo.\n\
      ; roundtimelimit :  This specifies the amount of time in minutes that each Territories\
      \ round may last.\n; suddendeathseconds :  This specifes the amount of time\
      \ in seconds that any \"sudden death\" period can last before a draw is declared.\n\
      ; KarmaMP :  Can be set to True (or 1) to enable Karma Physics in multiplayer.\
      \  '''Do not''' do this unless your server is an absoloute beast of a machine\
      \ and everyone has LAN connections.  The default value is False (0).  Players\
      \ will not be able to move objects unless this is set.\n; GameMode :  This parameter\
      \ can be used to place the game in arcade mode or simulation mode.  A value\
      \ of \"arcade\" ''or'' 0 will put the game into arcade mode.  A value of \"\
      simulation\" ''or'' 1 will put the game into simulation mode.  Players are able\
      \ to pick up and throw objects in either game mode as long as ''KarmaMP'' is\
      \ enabled.\n; PktLoss : Can be used to simulate an amount of packet loss. Values\
      \ can range from 0 to ??. Mostly useful for development.\n; PktLag : Can be\
      \ used to simlutate an amount of lag.  Values can range from 0 to ??. Mostly\
      \ useful for development.\n\nThe following values have been taken from an inspection\
      \ of the code and have not been tested.  They may not be useable.\n; GameSpeed\
      \ : Overrides the default gamespeed set within the INI file.\n; Mutator : Support\
      \ for comma delimited lists of mutators seems to have been left in \\o/\n; GamePassword\
      \ : Can be used to set the game password, and overrides the value within the\
      \ INI file.\n; LocalLog : True if stats should be logged locally, otherwise\
      \ False.  Defaults to True.\n; WorldLog : True if stats should be sent to the\
      \ \"World Log\", otherwise False.  Defaults to True.\n; restart : Can be used\
      \ to restart the current map using all previous specified values.  Changes to\
      \ the previous configuration can then be made by re-specifying values for specific\
      \ parameters (or adding new ones)\n; DefaultDelay : The default respawn delay\
      \ time for Territories\n; AccessCenter : The default class to use for an \"\
      access center\".\n; SpawnCenter : The default class to use for a \"spawn center\"\
      .\n; BotManager : The default class to use as a \"Bot manager\".\n; TeamManager\
      \ : The default class to use as a \"Team manager\".\n; EffectsManager : The\
      \ default class to use as an \"Effects manager\".\n; DamageControl : The default\
      \ class to use for \"Damage\" modifications\n\nThe following settings exist,\
      \ but are either unused for servers or for development purposes only.\n; Difficulty\
      \ : Unused\n; unlocked : Internal use only\n; frominterface : Internal use only\n\
      ; NoBots : Unused\n; Comments : Unused\n; Bots : Unused\n; HUD : Unused\n; Test\
      \ : Unused\n\n==Maintaining the INI File ==\n\n===Setting the Map Rotation ===\n\
      \nUnlike UT and UT2003 Devastation allows you to mix and match game types and\
      \ game configurations in a single 32 map rotation.  This means that large CTF\
      \ maps can be played with a low capture limit and small fast paced ones can\
      \ be played with a higher cap limit.  The same applies to DM style gametypes.\n\
      \nThe maps and map settings are specified in the ''[DGamePlay.DSWMapList]''\
      \ section of the devsvr.ini file.  Edit it so that it looks like the section\
      \ below.\n\n  [DGamePlay.DSWMapList] \n  GameMode=1\n  bKarmaMP=False\n  Language=itt\n\

      \ I'm going to try putting the values \"out of order\" in my ini later today.\
      \  It should work OK and will keep the map name and the map settings together.\
      \  Makes things easier to tweak then.\n\nThis places two maps in the map rotation.\
      \  The first is the CTF-Union map and the second is the DM-EmbarcaderoDepot\
      \ map.  The CTF map has a time limit of 30 and a cap limit of 8.  The DM map\
      \ also has a time limit of 30 and a frag limit of 30.  The settings that can\
      \ be passed along with the ? parameters are covered in the next section.\n\n\
      ===Other INI File Settings ===\n\nIn this section I'll be covering the bare\
      \ minimum of INI file settings to control the server in terms of listening port\
      \ and behaviour.  There are many others but they are beyond the scope of this\
      \ page (i.e. I'm too lazy to add them.  Maybe someone else will do it).\n\n\

      \  e.g. For a standard ADSL line, which has an upload speed of 256Kbps (which\
      \ is around 25KBps, 4 players @ a MaxClientRate of 6000 = 24000.  This is about\
      \ right.  A quick (and reasonable) way of calculating bytes per second from\

      \ server is available: http://icculus.org/news/news.php?id=1416\n\n(More official\
      \ mirrors from ARUSH/Digitalo will be posted when I'm aware of them).\n\nThis\
      \ should be considered beta quality for a little while yet, but works pretty\
      \ well. FreeBSD admins can use this if they've got Linux binary compatibility\
      \ installed. Information on reporting bugs and how to get on the Linux admin\
      \ mailing list for discussion are in the README that comes with the server.\
      \ Linux UT/UT2003 admins will recognize the \"ucc-bin\" program in the System\
      \ directory, which is used instead of the Windows \"devastation.exe -server\"\
      \ or \"ucc.exe\". The quickest startup is to run it from a Terminal window like\
      \ this:\n\ncd /where/i/unpacked/devastation_dedicated/System\n\n./ucc-bin server\
      \ CTF-Chozo\n\nWhere \"CTF-Chozo\" is a valid Devastation map name.\n\nOn Windows,\
      \ files are written under \"My Documents\". On Linux, they'll end up in \".devastation\"\
      \ in your home directory. You can opt to keep everything in the actual game\
      \ directories by adding \"-nohomedir\" to the end of the command line:\n\n./ucc-bin\
      \ server CTF-Chozo -nohomedir\n\nTo shut down the server, hit CTRL-C.\n\nThere\
      \ are a LOT of command lines and .ini file tweaks...just about everything not\
      \ mentioned here that applies to the Windows server also applies to the Linux\
      \ one.\n\n==Other Sources of Information ==\n\nSome other places to look for\
      \ information on running an Unreal Engine based server are listed below.\n*\

      * http://unreal.epicgames.com/utServers.htm  &ndash;  The original Epic document\
      \ on running Unreal Tournament servers.  Much of it still applies.\n* http://developer.devastationgame.com/Technical/ConsoleCommandLineParameters.html\

      \ for UT2003.\n\n===Thanks and Acknowledgements ===\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Many\
      \ thanks to the chaps over on the official Devastation forum who worked out\
      \ a lot of this stuff.  Particular thanks to ''MayDay'' and ''EaSyKiLL''.\n\n\
      '''Digitalo:''' Many thanks to EntropicLqd and the rest of the community for\
      \ this kick ass doc!\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Thanks for the updates.  Nice.\n\n\
      '''Ragdoll:''' I assume that the server command is entered into the command\
      \ prompt? If this is true, then why do i always get a message saying \"devastation.exe\
      \ is not a program/cannot be found etc...\"\n\nIf it isnt in the command prompt\
      \ could you please tell me where?\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I'm not familiar with the\
      \ Devestation Dedicated server system, but in UT200X, when you start a dedicated\
      \ server, there is usually a little console that looks similar to the log file\
      \ (that shows up when you type 'showlog' in the ingame console.)  It should\
      \ say Devestation Server on it or something.  There should also be a place at\
      \ the bottom for you to type in server specific commands.\n\n'''Ragdoll:'''\
      \ The problem is, the master devastation server has gone so you cannot start\
      \ a server from within the multiplayer as you would normally. There is a external\
      \ program called the all seeing eye that is used to connect to servers that\
      \ have already been set up(more info on the eye at [[Legacy:Devastation|Devastation]]\
      \ Home page, look for the link). I should have mentioned that earlier, but does\
      \ the eye mean i have to configure anything differently?\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ It shouldn't do.  Whenever I set up a Devastation server I always used the\
      \ ucc server route rather than the game itself to do it.  I don't have Devastation\
      \ installed anymore so I can't check.  You will need to be in the /devastation/system\
      \ directory to run the server up if you want to do it from the command prompt.\
      \  Failing that, you can setup a windows short cut.  Make the starting directory\
      \ the /devastation/system directory and add the command line switches to the\
      \ shortcut.  The ASE server should already be configured within the INI file\
      \ so the server should automatically register there.\n\n'''Ragdoll:'''Perhaps\
      \ i should try to explain my situation a bit clearer. I have not sucessfully\
      \ started the server yet, i am trying to enter the \"devastation.exe -server\"\
      \ command to actually start running the server. I am confused over where this\
      \ commnad is entered."
