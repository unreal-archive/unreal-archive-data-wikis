      \ builder brush, so that the red builder brush completely encloses all of the\
      \ the shape (typically with space around it), but, not any other CSG (Constructive\
      \ Solid Geometry). Then, select from the Brush menu: <i>Brush -&gt; Intersect</i>.\
      \ The shape will be transformed into the red builder brush. At this point, if\
      \ you want to save the brush for possible re-use at a later time, export it.\

      \ if you don't already know how to do this.\n\n# the RBB needs to be 'clean',\
      \ ie no rotations or scalings. To ensure this, either do [[Legacy:Brush Context\
      \  Menu|Brush Context  Menu]] -> Transform -> [[Legacy:Transform Permanently|Transform\
      \ Permanently]]or [[Legacy:Brush Context  Menu|Brush Context  Menu]] -> Reset\
      \ -> Reset All\n# shape the RBB so it encloses all of the template. Remember,\
      \ you can't use [[Legacy:Brush Scaling|Brush Scaling]] to do this &ndash; only\
      \ the settings in the [[Legacy:Brushbuilders|brushbuilders]] window.\n# Intersect\
      \ the RBB with geometry (menu command of the [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]] button)\n\
      \nAt this point, if you want to save the brush for possible re-use at a later\
      \ time, export it. Select '''[[Legacy:UnrealEd Main Menu|UnrealEd Main Menu]]\
      \ -> Brush -> Export''', give it a name and select a directory to save it in.\n\
      \nYou can delete the template and the room now, although it's advisable to keep\
      \ it until your map is finished, in case you want to remake your mover.\n\n\
      ----\n\nIt's essential that the RBB is used to add the mover, it doesn't have\
      \ any [[Legacy:Brush Transformation|brush transformation]]s currently applied.\
      \ The RBB remembers transformations such as scaling and rotation until they\
      \ are cleared with one of the \"Reset\" commands in the [[Legacy:Brush Context\
      \  Menu|Brush Context  Menu]]. You can either reset it before intersecting,\
      \ or apply transformations permanently in the next section...\n\n''(next paragraph\
      \ could be shunted & merged into the Intersection page maybe)''\n\nIt's basically\
      \ simple. The shape that you have created, if it complex (more than one combined\
      \ or adjacent primitive) must be just one brush for the mover to operate as\
      \ a single entity in your level. Surround the complex brushes that are to be\
      \ your mover with the red builder brush, so that the red builder brush completely\
      \ encloses all of the the shape (typically with space around it), but, not any\
      \ other CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry). Then, select from the Brush menu:\
      \ ''Brush -> Intersect''. The shape will be transformed into the red builder\
      \ brush. At this point, if you want to save the brush for possible re-use at\
      \ a later time, export it. Select from the Brush menu: ''Brush -> Export''.\
      \ You then must give it a name and select a directory to save it in.\n\n'''''NOTE\
      \ : you must not rescale the RBB! Else the mover would be completely non-solid\
      \ :( So to have it encompass all the shapes of the future mover you have to\
      \ make it bigger <u>USING THE MENU BOX TO CHANGE ITS DIMENSIONs</u> (Right click\
      \ in the cube Brushbuilder to do this) '''''\n\n==Adding the Mover==\n\nPosition\
      \ the RBB where the mover should be when at rest. \n\nIf there are any brush\
      \ transformations applied to it, apply them permanently by doing [[Legacy:Brush\
      \ Context  Menu|Brush Context  Menu]] -> Transform -> [[Legacy:Transform Permanently|Transform\
      \ Permanently]]. You can check for these under the brush properties: Brush ->\
      \ MainScale, Brush -> PostScale and Movement -> Rotation.\n\n(note: I need to\
      \ check up on the finer points of this, as I know it's fine for a lift to be\
      \ Yawed into place, as long as you don't want movement rotations)\n\n[[Image:Legacy_Mover_butt.gif|left|Mover\
      \ Button]]\n\nTo add the mover click on the mover button in the UnrealEd [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]].\
      \  It's in the same bar as the Add/Subtract and looks like the thingy in the\
      \ picture.\n\nThe mover will appear as a purple brush wireframe in all viewports.\
      \  You won't be able to see the textures like you would in a regular brush.\
      \  This is a not a bad thing.  This allows you to move it around and play with\
      \ it when you're setting [[Legacy:Keyframe|keyframe]]s without having to constantly\
      \ rebuild geometery.  \n\n==Changing Textures==\n\nWhat if I want to ''change\
      \ me textures on the mover'' you ask?  Well too bad!! J/k:)  Simply do [[Legacy:Brush\
      \ Context Menu|Brush Context Menu]] -> Mover -> Show Polys and tada your mover\
      \ is now visible as a brush and you can retexture and touch up on it. Once you\
      \ rebuild the geometry it will return to the purple outline.\n\nNote: If you\
      \ are just changing something like making a surface of the mover unlit, you\
      \ can rebuild <i>just</i> lighting, which will not return the brush to its purple\
      \ outline.\n\n* Careful using the [[Legacy:Brush Context Menu|Brush Context\
      \ Menu]] -> Mover -> Show Polys command. Known to cause UEd crashes if used\
      \ improperly.\n\n==Setting Up Keyframes==\n\nSo you have your mover looking\
      \ the way you want it, and you have a [[Legacy:Red Builder Brush|red builder\
      \ brush]] of your mover's likeness.  Now what?  Well you need to animate it.\
      \  So go on to the [[Legacy:Keyframe|Keyframe]] page and find out how to put\
      \ a little life into your mover.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Mover Topics|Mover\
