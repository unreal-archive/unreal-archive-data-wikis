      <p>Hmm well, now some uninteresting stuff about an even more uninteresting german\
      \ guy...</p>\n<p>I'm 18 right now and live in Germany. Currently I'm about to\
      \ finish my \"Abitur\" in 2 years. You can call me Shadow, Shad or Stephan (my\
      \ real name). I got my nickname from friends when they were amazed at my love\
      \ for lighting and shadows.. ha ha.. how inventive..</p>\n<p>I started primitive\
      \ developing back in 1996 with Heretic (and it's fucking ED..).</p>\n<p>1998\
      \ Unreal was released and through my interest for Editors and Mapping I took\
      \ the first looks into the UnrealED and made some CRAP-maps ha ha. With the\
      \ release of UnrealTournament I started coding, mostly interested through my\
      \ already existing experience in Basic, Q-Basic, TurboPascal .. noticing that\
      \ UnrealScript was a fine programming language xD</p>\n<p>After some days of\
      \ practise I coded the first mutators and small weapon mods mostly for friends.</p>\n\
      <p>Around 2003 I gained more and more experience in C++ and Mapping too. With\
      \ the time I became some kind of Mapper/Coder Hybrid. My first big project was\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Lost_Secrets_Of_Na_Pali\" title=\"Legacy:Lost Secrets Of\
      \ Na Pali\">Lost Secrets of Na Pali</a> (short: <a href=\"/Legacy:Lost_Secrets_Of_Na_Pali\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Lost Secrets Of Na Pali\">LSoNP</a>), started when I was 16...\
      \ First it was thought as a smaller Singleplayer-Campaign but during developing\
      \ many graphical extensions have been made and the project expanded to a Total\
      \ Conversion while the count of Team Members grow to more than 15 guys. However\
      \ .. it failed during 2006 and was cancelled then. After some serious discussion\
      \ we decided that I'll work on an indipendent Bonus Pack containing the extensions\
      \ been made for <a href=\"/Legacy:Lost_Secrets_Of_Na_Pali\" title=\"Legacy:Lost\
      \ Secrets Of Na Pali\">LSoNP</a>. During concrete developing of the Pack more\
      \ and more features were added to the already existing ones. This now is my\
      \ current project. The <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealTournament_Extension_Pack\" title=\"\
      Legacy:UnrealTournament Extension Pack\">UnrealTournament Extension Pack</a>.\
      \ The Render with the extended Mesh System and the Hardware Post Processing\
      \ Effects was coded by moonangel (ex-HeadCoder of the LSoNP-Team), everything\
      \ else is completely done by me.</p>\n<p>I mostly stick with UT99 because I\
      \ have more experience than for other UnrealEngine Games I also never got that\
      \ interested in UT2004 and so on. I also think that UT99 is far from dead, many\
      \ good and great Mods and even Total Conversions are been made (<a rel=\"nofollow\"\

      \ of Team Members grow to more than 15 guys. However .. it failed during 2006\
      \ and was cancelled then. After some serious discussion we decided that I'll\
      \ work on an indipendent Bonus Pack containing the extensions been made for\
      \ [[Legacy:Lost Secrets Of Na Pali|LSoNP]]. During concrete developing of the\
      \ Pack more and more features were added to the already existing ones. This\
      \ now is my current project. The [[Legacy:UnrealTournament Extension Pack|UnrealTournament\
      \ Extension Pack]]. The Render with the extended Mesh System and the Hardware\
      \ Post Processing Effects was coded by moonangel (ex-HeadCoder of the LSoNP-Team),\
      \ everything else is completely done by me.\n\nI mostly stick with UT99 because\
      \ I have more experience than for other UnrealEngine Games I also never got\
      \ that interested in UT2004 and so on. I also think that UT99 is far from dead,\
      \ many good and great Mods and even Total Conversions are been made ([http://www.moddb.com/mods/364/marathon-resurrection\

      \ UNREAL: Battle for Na Pali].. just to name SOME) and I hope that one of these\
      \ great titles will finally be voted in MOTY (ModDB Mod of the Year) 2008 Top100\

      \ UnrealSP.org Forums]\n\n===Prefered Skills===\n\nI'm mostly skilled in:\n\n\
      ====Coding====\n* Canvas/HUD\n* Physics (including Quaternions)\n* Items/Pickups\
      \ (especially Weapons)\n* Mutators\n* Pawn/AI Coding\n* Native Coding \n* Decals\n\
      * Lights/LightEffects/Lighting\n* Triggers/SpecialEvents/Keypoints\n* Effects,\
      \ ParticleSystems, extended Graphics\n* Gameinfos and Gametypes\n* Projectiles\n\
      * Objects and UWindow System\n* UnrealMenu System\n* Movers (but not BrushBuilders\
      \ :P)\n\n====Mapping====\n* Decent Architecture\n* good basic and advanced Singleplayer\
      \ Mapping Knowledge (but Multiplayer Mapping too ^^..)\n* Concerned about Lighting\n\
      * Cutscenes/Scripted Sequences\n* Aligning Techniques\n* Gameplay and Map-Build\
      \ Ideas\n* Item-Placement\n* all in all what you need to be a \"good\" Mapper\n\
      \nNow that should be enough information about me now..\n\n----\n\nSide-Note:\
      \ you'll often notice an \"xt\"-prefix placed at many names, it's just short\
      \ for [[Legacy:UnrealTournament Extension Pack|UnrealTournament Extension Pack]]\
      \ (eXTension) and indicates that this project has something to do with it however..\n\
      \n===Projects (UT99)===\n\n====Mutators====\n\nThere have been some Mutators\
      \ made by me, but never released.. well except a Mutator in a Map by Creavion\
      \ (a \"Mapper-Buddy\" of mine, ex-HeadMapper of the LSoNP-Team). \n\n'''Combiner\
      \ Weapons/xtSpecialWeapons''' [http://www.unrealsp.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=497&sid=48d7e735eab48927cb343a109083e38f\
      \ xtSpecialWeapons in DM-Ryigiar (Special-Edition)]\n\nxtSpecialWeapons is a\
      \ public pre-Release Version of Weapons capable of Overlayers/Combiners using\
      \ the Canvas that the [[Legacy:UnrealTournament Extension Pack|UnrealTournament\
      \ Extension Pack]] will contain. It does only contain 10 revamped UT Weapons\
      \ (no Redeemer, no Translocator, no Chainsaw) in the [[Legacy:UnrealTournament\
      \ Extension Pack|Extension Pack]] there'll be all UT Weapons + all Unreal Weapons\
      \ with revamped graphics.\n\n====Mods====\n\n'''UNREAL: Phoenix Rising''\n\n\
      This mod is a special complete version of Unreal (only the Maps and System files,\
      \ it still needs an UnrealEngine Game to be played (preferably UnrealTournament))\
      \ in a whole refreshed look and feel. The enhanced graphics are based on the\
      \ [[Legacy:UnrealTournament Extension Pack|Extension Pack]] below and it will\
      \ also contain some totally new content and features.\n\n====Developing Packs/SDKs====\n\
      \n'''UnrealTournament Extension Pack''\n\nIt's an indipendent [[Legacy:UnrealTournament\
      \ Extension Pack|Developing Package]] for the old UnrealTournament containing\
      \ besides many new graphical features (PostProcessing, completely new MeshSystem,\
      \ Emitters, Projectors..), new physics and vehicles, new sound features, extended\
      \ AI, several Gameplay Systems and Actors, Tech Demos and so on. It ships with\
      \ tons of example content and tutorials, tech demos and test maps. There're\
      \ also 6 projects right now officialy cooperating and using the [[Legacy:UnrealTournament\
      \ Extension Pack|Pack]] to improve their own project. 1 is a Map and the other\
      \ 5 are big Mods and also Total Conversions...\n\n====Tools====\n\n'''xtMeshTool''\n\
      \nThe [[Legacy:XtMeshTool|xtMeshTool]] is a special UnrealEngine Tool first\
      \ coded by moonangel and CWF for [[Legacy:Lost Secrets Of Na Pali|LSoNP]] and\
      \ continued now by me. It allows converting prefabs and 3dsmax models into the\
      \ Hardware Meshes for the new Mesh System of the Extension Pack. It's mostly\
      \ compatible with the UnrealEngine 1 and the UnrealED 2 but it still lacks a\
      \ collision support...\n\n===Projects (UT III)===\n\nSorry nothing here yet...\
      \ As soon as I get a new PC I'll continue UnrealEngine Developing on the UnrealEngine\
      \ 3.\n\nIt's still open if [[Legacy:Lost Secrets Of Na Pali|LSoNP]] will probably\
      \ be ported to the UnrealEngine 3 one day, but personally.. I can only imagine\
      \ mapping a good DM-Map for UT III now, since it still lacks (good..) community\
      \ content (especially maps) but not continuing [[Legacy:Lost Secrets Of Na Pali|LSoNP]].\n\
