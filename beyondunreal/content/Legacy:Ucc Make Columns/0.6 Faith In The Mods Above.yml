      \ and sound, more involved and interesting gameplay, and they expand their own\
      \ definition a little bit more. Wolfenstein3D had simplistic 2.5 dimensioned\
      \ graphics with sprites. DOOM took that and gave it atmosphere and style. Quake\
      \ took that and gave it true 3D, and so on.</p>\n<p>Mods have been slowly evolving\
      \ too, and have now become full-blown projects and occasionally commercial-quality\
      \ games on their own. Mods are often attributed with elongating the lifespan\
      \ of a game, an example being no farther than the obvious: Counter-Strike, which\
      \ has kept Half-Life on the shelves years after it's prime. Sometimes in the\
      \ case of Counter-Strike, it's a Total Conversion which adds a whole new game\
      \ to the engine. In some cases, like Counter-Strike and also Tactical Ops, this\
      \ can also end up being a whole new product. In some cases, as in Serious Sam\
      \ or Max Payne, it quickly adds features to the game which make an established\
      \ product that much better.</p>\n<p>Unreal has always been a little ahead of\
      \ the curve for mods. One of the reasons I bought the original game was because\
      \ the editor came with it. It's adherence to UnrealScript (unlike the Quake\
      \ series which has changed it's mod language over the years), it's modularity\
      \ (anyone who doesn't see the mutator concept as ingenious is simply near-sighted),\
      \ and easy access to professional-level code and samples makes Unreal one of\
      \ the most versatile and powerful platforms for mods today.</p>\n<p>Lately,\
      \ the Unreal community has been talking about one thing - the recently announced\
      \ fact that Unreal II (or Unreal Episode II or whatever it's being called now)\
      \ won't have multiplayer features. This means that the much anticipated Expanded\
      \ Multiplayer (XMP) won't be shipping with the game, as well as the standard\
      \ multiplayer gametypes. Epic's and Legend's reasoning seems clear. Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2(003) will be out first, and two games with similar multiplayer functions\
      \ could create market confusion (a fact discussed by gamers since a sequel to\
      \ UT was officially announced). Also, previews of the Unreal sequel have made\
      \ two things clear. One - this game is going to be all about single player.\
      \ Two - the much anticipated XMP had barely begun development, if at all.</p>\n\
      <p>Gamers, however, don't really like reading previews about something for some\
      \ time only to find out it's not going to exist. Also, the way the information\
      \ has been offered (in web interviews and forum postings) has only just now\
      \ begun to answer some questions. The feeling of loss is understandable. While\
      \ the two games might have duplicate functionality in the way of multiplayer,\
      \ they will also have completely different sets of content, style and features.\
      \ Unreal Episode II is to have different alien races, classes, and weapons from\
      \ Unreal Tournament 2003, not to mention levels, characters and more. Does this\
      \ mean that if we want to try out those new Izarian weapons against some Skaarj\
      \ in a DeathMatch, we'll never be able to?</p>\n<p>I doubt it. Unreal was the\
      \ game that brought a new meaning to modularity for the gaming world. For the\
      \ first time, a company might actually be expecting a mod community to pick\
      \ up where the developers left off and provide features the gamers want. After\
      \ all, who better to know what the gamers want than the gamers themselves? The\
      \ netcode and basic functionality of multiplayer is in the licensed Unreal engine.\
      \ Epic and Legend would do well to make sure that on Day 1 of the release, the\
      \ mod community is given everything they need to start making new maps, new\
      \ mods, and multiplayer gametypes. Most of us will be buying both games, and\
      \ will have already been hacking away at UT2003. This strategy would mean that\
      \ Legend could spend a minimal amount of prepping this information while still\
      \ developing the killer single-player that the game will probably be remembered\
      \ for.</p>\n<p>Released early enough in the Christmas season, we could see rudimentary\
      \ mulitplayer by New Year's.</p>\n<p>Naturally some of this is speculation.\
      \ So is the fact that Unreal Episode II's single player is going to seriously\
      \ kick some ass.</p>\n<p>So is my guess that XMP will still make it out in some\
      \ form, at some time, even if it ends up getting it's own box. Legend knows\
      \ it's a good idea. So do gamers. Selling good ideas is often good market sense.</p>\n\
      <p>We'll just have to wait and see. Personally, I have faith the mods will extend\
