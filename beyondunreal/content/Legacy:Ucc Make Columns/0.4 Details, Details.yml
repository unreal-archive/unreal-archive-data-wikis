      \ known he was an artist in the realm of directing films. For a science fiction\
      \ movie of it's day, Alien had style...it blended horror and science concepts\
      \ into a design that no other film had tried before, even though fiction for\
      \ the longest time knew that horror, fantasy and sci-fi were but kissing cousins\
      \ to each other.</p>\n<p>I just returned from Black Hawk Down, a movie which\
      \ for me reaffirms Scott's ability to throw art onto the silver screen (and\
      \ also restates my feelings that Oscars don't know squat ... Beautiful Mind\
      \ nominated for best pic and not this? insanity). Also, for those that actually\
      \ wanted to read this column on time - it's late because I was curious to see\
      \ what impact the movie would have on it...</p>\n<p>...most of you, however,\
      \ are just waiting for me to get to the point.</p>\n<p>There is this scene in\
      \ BHD where Josh Hartnett's character is raising his head after getting orders,\
      \ after being crouched in cover from enemy fire. His helmet gets caught in barbed\
      \ wire that had been wrapped in the remains of the wall that has been covering\
      \ him. Hartnett has to carefully move his head out of the wire trappings before\
      \ heading out with his men.</p>\n<p>See the point yet?</p>\n<p>Someone had to\
      \ design that barb wire. They had to think about it being on that wall, why\
      \ it would be on the wall (this is war-torn Somalia, not New York). It had to\
      \ be placed, rigged, and setup perfectly so that when Hartnett turned his head\
      \ to his troops, his helmet would be caught in it.</p>\n<p>It's not a tense\
      \ situation (well, no more than the other 143 minutes of the film). It's not\
      \ important in any way for the plot. The barb wire doesn't come up later to\
      \ help a character learn a moral lesson. To paraphrase your standard Freud critic,\
      \ sometimes barb wire is just barb wire.</p>\n<p>The barb wire is just one of\
      \ about 1,000 details Scott uses in the movie to catapult the viewer into this\
      \ world that basically none of us have ever witnessed. For us Americans, the\
      \ Somalian incident was almost a cover-up...it received little of the news and\
      \ editorial coverage it clearly deserved. BHD recreates a concept that we readily\
      \ had no access to. Largely, it does this by the details. The barb wire, the\
      \ spray paint on the wall, the children playing in the battlefield, the taping\
      \ of one's blood type to one's boot - details depicting war. The great cinematography\
      \ and visual effects are nice - but they don't trump the barb wire scene.</p>\n\
      <p>Games provide a similar experience to movies - they are supposed to give\
      \ us an experience we do not readily have access to. How much we buy into this\
      \ new world can sometimes be determined by the details. In literature, the success\
      \ at doing this is called suspension of disbelief. In short, it is a contract\
      \ between the author and the reader that the reader will believe in the author's\
      \ creation and the author will give him justification for doing so. Whether\
      \ that world is a war-torn country or an alien planet, the reader needs the\
      \ details to accept the contract.</p>\n<p>Sci-Fi/Horror/Fantasy writers rely\
      \ on suspension of disbelief. It's a cornerstone for the genres. If the reader\
      \ is unacceptable to the origins of Alien Race X, they are unlikely to care\
      \ anything about Race X ... and possibly to finish reading the story. Games,\
      \ in general, have a simpler task. They aren't bound, usually, by the same constraints\
      \ of plot and character as literature. Many FPS games go by the \"lone marine\
      \ against a horde of evil\" concept just fine. Even some old-school RPG games\
      \ don't expand much more than \"get this item and bring it back to me\" or \"\
      find this villain and kill it\".</p>\n<p>The details you can provide depend\
      \ on the technology you are using. The acclaimed FPS game Deus Ex has plenty\
      \ of details - from the types of weapons you can carry, to the reasons why nano-augmentation\
      \ works the way it does, to what a character will say to you. They're all part\
      \ of a large design which makes that design seem believable - plausible.</p>\n\
      <p>I could ramble off example after example. Instead, I'll say this to mod-makers/mappers/general\
      \ game creators: if you are thinking about whether a certain feature should\
      \ exist, think about it not only terms of how it will effect the overall gameplay...but\
      \ how it effects what the user will think about the game. If adding an element\
      \ to the HUD of your game doesn't impact the play at all, but does lend the\
      \ user to believe whatever world you are trying to create, it's probably worth\
      \ it.</p>\n<p>And if you do that 999 more times, you might make the Black Hawk\
      \ Down of games.</p>\n<p>Till next time, kiddies, brush your teeth and don't\
