      \ games, dying is just part of the system. It's expected. Few people loaded\
      \ up Counter-Strike the first time and thought, \"I'm never going to be defeated\"\
      \ ... and those that did were among the first to go. Truth is, when a game has\
      \ a feature called \"Deathmatch\", death is pretty much inevitable for your\
      \ online alter ego.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean, however, that death is particularly\
      \ fun.</p>\n<p>For instance, I'm playing Aliens Versus Predator 2. This recent\
      \ Lithtech-powered release has some truly great features to it, but is also\
      \ filled with the occasional annoyances. One such example is when I was playing\
      \ as an alien drone, had just chopped up a few victims and was looking to get\
      \ a quick getaway. Since aliens are equipped with that nifty ability to walk\
      \ on walls, I hopped on the nearest one and made a break for it.</p>\n<p>Apparently\
      \ going over the wall wasn't what the game designer had in mind. When I hit\
      \ a small fence-like barrier at the top of the wall, I died.</p>\n<p>No warning,\
      \ don't pass go, alert the next of kin and load (slowly I might add) up that\
      \ last quick save.</p>\n<p>Those silly humans. They attacked me with *guns*\
      \ - they should have used fences. Apparently fences are the instagib of the\
      \ AvP world.</p>\n<p>Why is this so bad and what does it have to do with mods?\
      \ Same answer for both questions. It's a step above mere frustration, or that\
      \ horrible inability to get past a certain point in a game. Players in a game\
      \ expect a sort of unwritten contract from the game design. They shouldn't need\
      \ to know all the rules of the game world, because most of them should be somewhat\
      \ intuitive.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of intuitive design: In the original\
      \ DOOM, there were explosive barrels. They glowed, and generally looked volatile.\
      \ Sure enough when you shot them, they exploded.</p>\n<p>When anyone picked\
      \ up the Redeemer in Unreal Tournament for first time, they expected it cause\
      \ something large and dangerous. They weren't disappointed.</p>\n<p>Designers\
      \ can use anything they like to alert the players of their possible destruction.\
      \ Visual clues like making lava look like lava, jumping sparks of electricity,\
      \ huge amounts of blackness to indicate those bottomless pits which don't seem\
      \ as rare in the FPS world as they are in our own. Signs, as in real signs saying\
      \ things like \"Hazardous Materials\", aren't necessarily out of place. Audio\
      \ clues like the sounds of sparks, evil sounding hums or even screams work well.\
      \ The more devastating the effect an object in a game will have on the player,\
      \ the more cues they deserve to know to avoid it.</p>\n<p>The popular FPS Half-Life\
      \ is filled to the brim with clues for the player, letting them know what's\
      \ been electrified, turned radioactive or just teleported in from another dimension.</p>\n\
      <p>If players have to spend too much time figuring out what an object is or\
      \ what it's effect will be on them, they'll probably just end up leaving it\
      \ alone - usually in frustration. The only exception to this are objects which\
      \ provide a solution to a puzzle, something that is meant to be figured out.\
      \ Even then, the player is generally aware that it's a puzzle.</p>\n<p>Game\
      \ designers should consider this even when looking at their HUD displays, user\
      \ manuals or other direct message to the player. If the player is confused by\
      \ this most basic level of interaction, the entire game is going to be a lot\
      \ harder than need be. In the end, add up enough objects that players leave\
      \ alone in frustration, and there sometimes isn't much of a game left.</p>\n\
      <p>Objects that may have disastrous effects on the player need to be handled\
      \ very carefully in game design. Notice how in the official Unreal Tournament\
      \ maps, death zones are clear, distinct and usually placed outside of the playing\
      \ area. Objects within the playing area are generally harmful, but allows the\
      \ player to escape somehow.</p>\n<p>Players should be the ones responsible for\
      \ their own death, not game design. Through stupidity, lack of ammo, bad aim\
      \ or just being purely outgunned, a player's death should be his or her own.\
      \ Realize this with level design, weapon balance, item creation and general\
      \ game rules - players shouldn't be punished just for playing.</p>\n<p>Till\
      \ next time, be fair to your players, frag often, and beware of unmarked fences.</p>\n\
      <p>P.S.-Don't take this as a condemnation on Aliens Versus Predator 2 as a game.\
      \ Overall, it's an insanely well designed game, blending the look and feel of\
      \ movies, comics and that horrible feeling you have that maybe that air pipe\
      \ isn't really an air pipe. An entire rant about a fence isn't a review, it's\
      \ a column.</p>\n<p>Other <a href=\"/Legacy:Ucc_make_columns\" title=\"Legacy:Ucc\
