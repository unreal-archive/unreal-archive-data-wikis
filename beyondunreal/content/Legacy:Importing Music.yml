      <p>This page will outline the procedure for getting music from various file\

      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>First of all, you have to\
      \ know which music format you've used so you can use the proper process to import\
      \ it into your map.</p>\n<p>Before I start with the more complex stuff, I can\
      \ tell you that <i>CD audio</i> files don't need to be imported into any Unreal\
      \ package - they're read directly from the CD and played back while the game\
      \ is playing.</p>\n<p>To import <i>music modules</i>, you need to make sure\
      \ the MOD meets to the audio quality demands that I posted above. After this,\
      \ it's easy: you need to open up the music browser in UEd, go to File &gt; Import...\
      \ and select the MOD and hit open. After this, a popup appears, asking you for\
      \ the package you want to import the MOD to. It's usually best to keep everything\
      \ as it is and click OK to import the MOD. After this, don't forget to <i>Save</i>\
      \ the imported music package. In the music browser, go to File &gt; Save as...\
      \ and choose OK. This will create a umx package containing your custom MOD in\
      \ the music folder. All music files are to be stored in the Music folder. See\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Engine_Directory_Structure\" title=\"Legacy:Engine Directory\
      \ Structure\">Engine Directory Structure</a> for more info.</p>\n<p>The same\
      \ rules are to be used when importing <i>direct music</i> files, like MID files.</p>\n\
      <p>If you want to import <i>real audio</i> files, like WAV, MP3 or AIFF, there's\
      \ a problem: Unreal Engine games don't support this kind of format (except for\
      \ Wheel of Time and the newer Unreal Engine games). I'll explain a little later\
      \ how you can import music for games that use the newer Unreal Engine, like\
      \ Unreal 2 &amp; UT2003. First how to import real audio files for older Unreal\
      \ games, like Unreal, UT &amp; Deus Ex.</p>\n<p>I've seen a lot of people asking\
      \ for a way to import real audio files into a umx. And I've also noticed that\
      \ a lot of them have imported the audio file as wav into MPT (ModPlug Tracker),\
      \ but upon playback in the game, the track looped back after the first 30 seconds\
      \ or so which was too soon, seeing their audio files were a lot longer. So after\
      \ a bit experimentation, I (<i>The Alien</i>) have found a way to solve this\
      \ problem, though I doubt that I'm the first one to find this out. Anyway, I've\
      \ written a tute on it, which you can find <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
      \ text\" href=\"http://home.tiscali.nl/ariadohq/ta/tutes/wavtoumx.html\">here</a>.\
      \ The trick to making the music play all the way to the end and <i>then</i>\
      \ loop back to the beginning is also included.</p>\n<p>As I said before, the\
      \ newer generation of the Unreal Engine supports real audio, but only when used\
      \ in the <i>Ogg Vorbis</i> format. The pros about this format are that companies\
      \ don't need to pay money to aquire an MP3 license and the high compression\
      \ rate (almost as high or higher than that of MP3). It has been confirmed that\
      \ the Unreal Engine galaxy sound system isn't used anymore. Furthermore, word\
      \ is that the new sound system doesn't support music modules at all, but this\
      \ isn't 100% certain. So it could even be possible that we won't even see the\
      \ umx packages in UT2003 and U2...</p>\n<p>Anyway, there are not many ogg converters\
      \ available just yet. The only one I know of is the plugin for winamp, which\
      \ you can get <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=67120\"\
      >here</a>. You can use this to convert other real audio to ogg files and use\
      \ them in your maps. As time passes, the ogg vorbis format will become more\
      \ and more popular, so expect to see ogg converters for other audio players\
      \ to become available. You can go to www.vorbis.com to find links and direct\
      \ downloads of Ogg Vorbis software, as well as all the information you could\
      \ possibly want on this type of music format.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ to do this, but am having a hard time finding anything on this topic.</p>\n\
      <p>So I went looking, and I just found some good tutorials</p>\n<p>first off\
      \ to get set up:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"\
      http://www.planetdeusex.com/heliowalton/Tutorial-Mp3-to-Umx.htm\">http://www.planetdeusex.com/heliowalton/Tutorial-Mp3-to-Umx.htm</a></p>\n\
      <p>Be sure to get modplug player and tracker, or tracker won't play your stuff.\
      \ Oh, and just get the song to .it format, don't put it in a map yet.</p>\n\
      <p>Now to get your music to loop in a map:</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external free\" href=\"http://www.bulldozer.utjag.co.uk/WaveToUMX.htm\">http://www.bulldozer.utjag.co.uk/WaveToUMX.htm</a>\
      \ but had to do it differently. Where it says</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Now, just like\
      \ you would select any text in a textarea, select all 3 chars from the Patern\
      \ Speed and use \"CTRL C\" to copy it to clipboard.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>From\
      \ the Patern Numbers, now select the next patern, being the Patern 1.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Select again that same area, that this time is empty, be carefull\
      \ to select the entire \"Effect\" area, and Use \"CTRL V\" to paste the chars\
      \ you've copied earlier from patern 0.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That didn't work for\
      \ me. The song would only play once...</p>\n<p>So I copied the entire section\
      \ for both channels, instead of just the pattern speed, then went to pattern\
      \ 1, and pasted it across both channels, so that they look identical to the\
      \ first line in pattern 0. The song loops indefinitely now.</p>\n<p>Before you\
      \ do all that, though, in modplug tracker, you can take a wav file and enhance\
      \ it a lot with tracker, go to general tab, and in effects, check bass expansion,\
      \ surround, agc, and in resample put it to high quality. Now go to the bottom,\
      \ and under effect plugins, click on select plugin... and under DirectX Media\
      \ Audio Effets, check on ParamEq, click okay, then under Channels one and two\
      \ (or more?) in the effect: box, change to FX1: ParamEq, and under effects plugin,\
      \ over to the right, chose Dry mix. Then set it to loop by following the directions\
      \ above...</p>\n<p>{BL}Ticklemonster</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time\
