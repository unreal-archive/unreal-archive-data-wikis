      \ given a great advert for having kids. I feel that perhaps I didn't convey\
      \ the true horror that is fatherhood in one short paragraph, so here's a more\
      \ lengthy analysis.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In order to truly appreciate the nightmarish\
      \ upheaval that has taken place in my life since my <i>little darlings</i> have\
      \ come into the world we need to rewind life a little to reveal a happy past.</p>\n\
      <p>Life was tranquil and calm, peace reigned supreme. I was able to get up when\
      \ I wanted at weekends and stroll into work early or late depending on how I\
      \ felt. My evenings and weekends were spent in glorious freedom; cutting code,\
      \ taking the wife out for meals, and reading interesting books on algorithm\
      \ design, project management, and team structure. The wife and I lived in married\
      \ bliss, our house was easily big enough for both of us, and everything had\
      \ a place. And every now and then I'd wake up with a hangover, roll over, and\
      \ go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>Now, lets wind forward in time, stopping briefly\
      \ to mention that being at the birth of a child is an awesome experience. However,\
      \ I should advise that this experience alone does not come close to being able\
      \ to make up for the trauma that is to come. So, off we go again, whizzing forward\
      \ in time to today.</p>\n<p>Every (children don't understand about weekends)\
      \ day now begins between 5am and 6am, abruptly. One (or both) of my <i>little\
      \ angels</i> will wake up and stroll into the bedroom making enough noise to\
      \ wake the entire street. They will then jump on me. If there's two of them\
      \ one will jump on my stomach and the other on my balls. If there's only one\
      \ they'll go for my balls every time. The only bright side about this is that\
      \ you can hear them coming and have enough time to prepare for the onslaught.\
      \ At this point one of two things will happen. The children will either demand\
      \ (in a \"if you don't do it we'll keep jumping on your balls until you do.\"\
      \ sort of way) to be taken downstairs and put in front of the TV, or, climb\
      \ into bed for some kip and a cuddle. The cuddle involves fidgeting, kicking,\
      \ scratching, and talking to everyone and playing with the huge pile of toys\
      \ they have somehow managed to carry from their room into our room. I am sure\
      \ this daily migration of cuddly toys breaks several laws of Newtonian physics.\
      \ By 6am I've generally had enough and get up.</p>\n<p>After getting washed,\
      \ dressed, and allegedly prepared for the day I then have to carry both of the\
      \ little elephants inhabiting my house downstairs, one in each arm, both clutching\
      \ their improbable piles of cuddly toys. They are not getting any lighter, and\
      \ I'm sure they add a toy each week – maybe to see at what point daddy puts\
      \ his back out trying to lift it all. The TV goes on and I have to change a\
      \ nappy, empty a potty, get them some milk, stop any fights that break out.\
      \ At this point I can escape to work and leave them to jump on the wife or trash\
      \ the lounge.</p>\n<p>I arrive home from work (between 3:30pm and 4pm since\
      \ I start so early) and get mobbed upon entry. My <i>little sweety-pies</i>\
      \ have drawn me some pictures and have been waiting to show me all day. After\
      \ inflicting their hideous scribblings upon my retina and making suitable \"\
      oooh ahhh, aren't they wonderful\" noises I get to take my coat off and collapse\
      \ in a chair. This is the signal that daddy has become a climbing frame, slide,\
      \ swing, and trampoline in one. So, after collecting some new bruises, getting\
      \ bruises on bruises, and having my balls crushed again (I think they just like\
      \ the \"arrrrgh!\" sound), they have something to eat. I've been in an hour\
      \ or two by now and I've not touched my PC or had a coffee. After tea they insist\
      \ that I re-read the same story at least once. The fact that it's the story\
      \ I read yesterday, the day before, the day before that, the day .... you can\
      \ see where I'm going here, is irellevant. It's the story they must have. Once\
      \ they've had the story they start to get grizzly and whiny. They are getting\
      \ tired. Then it's as many minutes as the wife and I can take of wailing, fighting,\
      \ temper tantrums, before marching them upstairs to bed.</p>\n<p>The time now\
      \ – once <i>my lovelies</i> have gone to bed, got up again, been put back to\
      \ bed, got up again, been put back to bed, eventually fallen asleep half-on\
      \ and half-off their bed buried in toys, blankets, and other miscellaneous debris\
      \ they've found in their bedroom – is 7pm. I've been changed from a (relatively)\
      \ fit, almost middle-aged, well adjusted and balanced man, into a wheezing wreck\
      \ of an individual whose first thought is committing murder, and whose second\
      \ thought is to try and remember what the first thought was.</p>\n<p>And my\
      \ house ... my house is tiny. Everything I own has been crammed into the smallest\
      \ room in the house. A tiny cramped pit. A pit that accumulates junk from all\
      \ over the house. The rest of the room in the house is taken up by stuff relating\
      \ to kids. Nappies, wipfe, and toys. The toys .. oh the toys. Big ones, small\
      \ ones, huge boxes of all this stuff that my kids liberally sprinkle over the\
      \ floor. Maybe they think it will make the carpet grow. There is no room in\
      \ my lounge, and there is no flat surface that isn't overflowing with unidentifiable\
      \ objects. Partly because everything is having to move higher to escape destruction\
      \ by inquiry from one or the other of my <i>enchanting little darlings</i>,\
      \ and partly because at least half of the available surface has some toys stacked\
      \ on it. There's scribbles on most of the walls. I could render my carpet down\
      \ as soup stock given the amount of food that's been dropped/hidden/cunningly\
      \ concealed beneath a layer of toys on them. In short, my once immaculate abode\
      \ looks like it's been trashed by an unruly party of 20 drunken 15 year olds\
      \ on a rampage.</p>\n<p>Before I had kids I was almost completely healthy. I\
      \ practically never got ill with anything. Since the <i>sweeties</i> have turned\
      \ up I feel like I should be permanently quarantined. Well, actually my kids\
      \ should be permanently quarantined but I digress. I get at least two colds\
      \ a year, plus all sorts of weird viruses and flus, most of which don't have\
      \ names but are probably tropical in origin. And that's just me. When the kids\
      \ get ill it's a nightmare. When they have a cold children don't just get a\
      \ bit of a snotty nose – that's a default state for a child. When a child gets\
      \ a cold they produce huge great long rail track like strands of snot from their\
      \ nose. And when they sneeze .... lets just say they could give Spiderman web\
      \ casting lessons. And if a child starts puking just make sure you've got some\
      \ boots, and a peg clipped to your nose, and never wear any clothes you want\
      \ to keep uncontaminated inside the house. Get changed in the garden if you\
      \ have to.</p>\n<p>Meal times are truly an experience. The person who invented\
      \ the bib was reasonably smart but didn't go nearly far enough – Bibs should\
      \ be a full blown easy-clean body bag with two holes for the kids eyes, and\
      \ one hole to put the food into. I'm not sure about they eye holes actually\
      \ – if they can't see what they are eating it might take them longer to tell\
      \ you they don't like it. My two <i>honeys</i> will quite happily smear food\
      \ all over their face, the table, the floor, and the chair they are sitting\
      \ on. In fact, anything they can reach is guaranteed to get a generous coating\
      \ of half masticated goo. If there's anything they can't reach then the spray\
      \ from their mouths as they talk while eating will do the job. My <i>honeys</i>\
      \ are able to turn weak stomached adults green in seconds at meal times. And\
      \ send unwary visitors scurrying for cover and the full body radiation suits\
      \ we keep in the cloak room.</p>\n<p>I could still go on ... I've not mentioned\
      \ the gradual destruction of my belongings, the fighting, whining, moaning or\
      \ whinging. The constant, wearing lack of a continuous nights sleep. The incessant\
      \ background noise .... there's still more I could write about....</p>\n<p>I\
      \ guess by this time you are wondering why I agreed (I was always a bit reluctant\
      \ and cagey) to have kids in the first place. Well, to be honest, I was lied\
      \ to. Not one single person told me the truth about what having kids was like.\
      \ They all said, \"Well, it's a bit of a change of life, but it's great fun\
      \ and very rewarding.\". If murder was legal I'd be hunting them down right\
      \ now. The only possible reason I can see for the lies is to ensure that I became\
      \ as miserable as they are. They obviously felt I was too happy in my child-free\
      \ life. And because of these lies I just ran out of excuses, and gave in to\
      \ the wife's \"I want kids\" demand. What I should have done was either left\
      \ or refused.</p>\n<p>But the very worst thing about kids is that once you've\
      \ got them, and you realise what a hideous mistake it was, it's too late. You\
      \ can't take them back to the store as faulty goods. They become a permanent\
      \ part of your life, sucking the cash out of your wallet faster and more effectively\
      \ than even the wife can manage.</p>\n<p>So, you still want to have kids? What\
      \ part of <b>\"don't do it! – run away!\"</b> didn't you understand?</p>\n<p><b>Disclaimer:</b>\
      \ I love my kids to bits - it's the only reason they are still alive. However,\
      \ <b>all</b> of the above comments have far more truth to them than you would\
      \ think. There are some good sides to having kids though – I'll write them down\
      \ here when I work out what they are.</p>\n<p><i>The above text is not to be\

      \ a big routine shift. I'd probably end up having my \"nocturnal\" moments around\
      \ 5am. It all sounds like hell, but it's not putting me off. A boy can get broody\

      \ taught me how to read the hour hand on the clock, and said I was to play in\
      \ my room &amp; not to wake them up until it reached a certain angle. Apparently\
      \ it worked, but then again I had a really good jigaw puzzle of a steam engine\
      \ that kept me occupied for hours on end.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>Dma:</b> I am 22\
      \ (last time I checked) and haven't been married. I haven't even been on anything\

      \ even more certain that I made the right choices. &#160;:-D</p>\n<p><b>Bean:</b>\
      \ This has further confirmed my decision to not have kids.&#160;:p</p>\n<p><b>Wang:</b>\
      \ I can pretty much confirm all of the above (even though I \"only\" have 1\
      \ little \"spirited\" 2 year old boy) (for \"spirited\" read: if you take your\
      \ eyes off him for a second he'll be diving off the sofa, climbing the kitchen\
      \ table, reprogramming all the radio stations on the hifi, spreading chocolate\
      \ over the remote controls and generally running everywhere as fast as he possibly\
      \ can with complete dis-regard for personal safety).</p>\n<p>I have not been\
      \ able to stay in bed beyond 8.00 a.m. for two years now (literally). I have\
      \ been able to stay up all night wiping his nose on numerous occasions. I am\
      \ unable to get within 2m of my pc while he is up unless I am prepared to deal\
      \ with the mother of all tantrums. Whilst he may appear to be playing happily\
      \ with his latest favourite toy, he is merely patiently waiting to deny me any\
      \ possibility of \"personal time\".</p>\n<p>However, the good points: Toys.\
      \ I can now relive my childhood and buy the new versions of all the toys I remember.\
      \ Just bought him a toy motorbike with a friction motor (it's not meant for\
      \ a 2 year old but I'm sure he'll grow into it&#160;:) ). The downside to this\
      \ is he seems to have the same taste in toys as me, since I can't get anywhere\
      \ near it without screams of \"mine\".</p>\n<p>Despite all this though he means\
      \ everything to me. If he's happy I'm happy. We had family over this weekend\
      \ and watched the videos we have taken of him. Just made me want to pick him\
      \ up love him to bits. The family didn't seem to get it though (\"can we fast\
      \ forward this?\" \"What this bit!!???, But he's about to roll over!!!!\").\
      \ I reckon it's a chemical imbalance parents have to prevent them from throttling\
      \ their kids.</p>\n<p>Quote:</p>\n<p>\"The rest of the room in the house is\
      \ taken up by stuff relating to kids. Nappies, wife, and toys.\" Assuming that\
      \ is a spelling mistake and it should read \"wife\", I sure hope she never gets\
      \ to see this page or you'll wish you were never born&#160;:)</p>\n<p>For Dma,\
      \ whilst I can't in all honesty recommend the kids bit the stuff before that\
      \ can be fun&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>NFG:</b> I love this page,...think Entropic\
      \ should become a MAJOR comedian. Anyway, I thought I'd add some frightening\
      \ real-life Intel on what my 2 year old nephew was like (Incredibly, he's still\
      \ alive).</p>\n<p>Occasionally, I'd visit my sister and brother-in-laws' house\
      \ to terrorize the kids (she has two, both very bright and very funny, about\
      \ grammar school age). My nephew's name is Kyle, and he was just fascinated\
      \ with (obssessed by actually) large mobile equipment transport and huge trucks.\
      \ His idea of fun was to run out in the road when a cement mixer or humongeous\
      \ construction crane was driving along, stand DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH, and yell\
      \ some thing like, \"Look at that Humongeous truck!\" He would actually laugh\
      \ when three or four frantic and terrified adults would race out into the road\
      \ and save him from a grizzly death. He was absolutely FEARLESS. Scared the\
      \ hell out me. After that, I never let him get beyond arm's length from me.\
      \ And, he attempted this ALL THE TIME. HE WAS A COMPLETE MANIAC. He'd just scream\
      \ excitedly, and try to run out into the road. When we were out in public, I\
      \ always made him wear an expedition-style, heavily re-inforced shirt, and,\
      \ had to pay to replace these on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>I think if I were\
      \ actually his Father, I would have made him wear a climbing harness at all\
      \ times, to which numerous industrial-strength elastic bungee-cords and nylon\
      \ ropes, rated to withstand the fall of a horse at 100 feet, were attached .\
      \ These would then be attached to major concrete structures with nautical winches.</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Hee hee. My eldest daughter likes to do the <i>run off\
      \ at high speed into mortal peril</i> trick every now and then. We do have a\
      \ harness for her, but the threat of a <i>clip round the ear</i> can also be\
      \ very effective. I really need to tweak the main content of the page. There's\
      \ a few typos in there and whole paragraphs missing. Hey <i>Wang</i> – how do\
      \ you manage to get them to stay in bed till 8am? That sounds like heaven. Heck,\
      \ even getting them to sleep in to 7am would be like heaven for me.</p>\n<p><b>Wang:</b>\
      \ Well despite the fact he is 2 he still sleeps in a cot with sides so he can't\
      \ get out. He could feasibly climb out now but we use an infant sleeping bag\
      \ that sufficiently restricts his leg movement that he can barely get to a standing\
      \ position&#160;:) He is a nightmare to get to sleep though often staying awake\
      \ till 9pm which is probably what causes him to sleep in \"late\". We have now\
      \ devised the clever plan of having mine and my wifes pc in the conservatory.\
      \ Full double glazing completely drowns out all screams from upstairs&#160;:p</p>\n\
      <p><b>Kerlin:</b> You have lots to look forward to, though. When they're 4 or\
      \ 5 they get their own juicebox in the morning. And now at 9, the kid's making\
      \ her own breakfast (bagel and cereal)...and microwave popcorn. She made a grilled\
      \ cheese sandwich with her mom the other day. Enjoy it while you can cause they\
      \ grow up fast. Ahhh christ, now I sound like my parents. I gotta get out of\
      \ here... <i>:)</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Aphex:</b> Oh crap.</p>\n<p><b>Aphex:</b>\
      \ Ah well, kid is now 2 yrs old, and just getting naughty (that is, more naughty\
      \ than before) Should have read this page more thoroughly I think. Wife is suggesting\

      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Hi M8 good to hear from you. Has it really been two years?\
      \ That's the problem with getting older - you blink and a year passes by. Stop\
      \ to cough and splutter a bit and suddenly your half a decade older. My two\
      \ (5 and 6 this year) do actually play very nicely together most of the time.\
      \ The rest of the time they are either wailing and crying or trying to kill\
      \ each other. Be warned that having two offspring running around the place is\
      \ more than twice as much work as having one. To be honest if the wife is suggesting\
      \ it you're probably doomed and you might as well give in sooner rather than\
      \ later as she'll get her own way in the end anyway. I was kind of lucky in\
      \ that having two was so much work that the wife didn't want any more (she originally\
      \ wanted three).</p>\n<p><b>T1:</b> 2 kids closer in age get along better because\
      \ they have similar interests and can't hurt each other as much. But if the\
      \ age difference is bigger, like 13 years or so, then the older one is usually\
      \ responsible enough not to hurt the little one. But the little one will probably\
      \ be an annoying pain in the ass to the older one.</p>\n<p><b>Aphex:</b> Yeah\
      \ Entropic - good to see you're still around. Yours are 5 &amp; 6 already!?\
      \ I know what you mean - time IS flying!!&#160;:( I'll get the wife to read\
      \ this I think, but yes... probably doomed lol &#160;;)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b>\
      \ I've heard that a parent is someone who gets up in the middle of the night\
      \ to see why their child is crying. A parent is also someone who gets up in\
      \ the middle of the night to see why thier child is not crying. You kinda have\
      \ to be a parent or know children well to get this, but I bet you get it Entropic.&#160;:)</p>\n\

      \ to lift it all.  The TV goes on and I have to change a nappy, empty a potty,\
      \ get them some milk, stop any fights that break out.  At this point I can escape\
      \ to work and leave them to jump on the wife or trash the lounge.\n\nI arrive\
      \ home from work (between 3:30pm and 4pm since I start so early) and get mobbed\
      \ upon entry.  My ''little sweety-pies'' have drawn me some pictures and have\
      \ been waiting to show me all day.  After inflicting their hideous scribblings\
      \ upon my retina and making suitable \"oooh ahhh, aren't they wonderful\" noises\
      \ I get to take my coat off and collapse in a chair.  This is the signal that\
      \ daddy has become a climbing frame, slide, swing, and trampoline in one.  So,\
      \ after collecting some new bruises, getting bruises on bruises, and having\
      \ my balls crushed again (I think they just like the \"arrrrgh!\" sound), they\
      \ have something to eat.  I've been in an hour or two by now and I've not touched\
      \ my PC or had a coffee.  After tea they insist that I re-read the same story\
      \ at least once.  The fact that it's the story I read yesterday, the day before,\
      \ the day before that, the day .... you can see where I'm going here, is irellevant.\
      \  It's the story they must have.  Once they've had the story they start to\
      \ get grizzly and whiny.  They are getting tired.  Then it's as many minutes\
      \ as the wife and I can take of wailing, fighting, temper tantrums, before marching\
      \ them upstairs to bed.\n\nThe time now &ndash; once ''my lovelies'' have gone\
      \ to bed, got up again, been put back to bed, got up again, been put back to\
      \ bed, eventually fallen asleep half-on and half-off their bed buried in toys,\
      \ blankets, and other miscellaneous debris they've found in their bedroom &ndash;\
      \ is 7pm.  I've been changed from a (relatively) fit, almost middle-aged, well\
      \ adjusted and balanced man, into a wheezing wreck of an individual whose first\
      \ thought is committing murder, and whose second thought is to try and remember\
      \ what the first thought was.\n\nAnd my house ... my house is tiny.  Everything\
      \ I own has been crammed into the smallest room in the house.  A tiny cramped\
      \ pit.  A pit that accumulates junk from all over the house.  The rest of the\
      \ room in the house is taken up by stuff relating to kids.  Nappies, wipfe,\
      \ and toys.  The toys .. oh the toys.  Big ones, small ones, huge boxes of all\
      \ this stuff that my kids liberally sprinkle over the floor.  Maybe they think\
      \ it will make the carpet grow.  There is no room in my lounge, and there is\
      \ no flat surface that isn't overflowing with unidentifiable objects.  Partly\
      \ because everything is having to move higher to escape destruction by inquiry\
      \ from one or the other of my ''enchanting little darlings'', and partly because\
      \ at least half of the available surface has some toys stacked on it.  There's\
      \ scribbles on most of the walls.  I could render my carpet down as soup stock\
      \ given the amount of food that's been dropped/hidden/cunningly concealed beneath\
      \ a layer of toys on them.  In short, my once immaculate abode looks like it's\
      \ been trashed by an unruly party of 20 drunken 15 year olds on a rampage.\n\
      \nBefore I had kids I was almost completely healthy.  I practically never got\
      \ ill with anything.  Since the ''sweeties'' have turned up I feel like I should\
      \ be permanently quarantined.  Well, actually my kids should be permanently\
      \ quarantined but I digress.  I get at least two colds a year, plus all sorts\
      \ of weird viruses and flus, most of which don't have names but are probably\
      \ tropical in origin.  And that's just me.  When the kids get ill it's a nightmare.\
      \  When they have a cold children don't just get a bit of a snotty nose &ndash;\
      \ that's a default state for a child.  When a child gets a cold they produce\
      \ huge great long rail track like strands of snot from their nose.  And when\
      \ they sneeze .... lets just say they could give Spiderman web casting lessons.\
      \  And if a child starts puking just make sure you've got some boots, and a\
      \ peg clipped to your nose, and never wear any clothes you want to keep uncontaminated\
      \  inside the house.  Get changed in the garden if you have to.\n\nMeal times\
      \ are truly an experience.  The person who invented the bib was reasonably smart\
      \ but didn't go nearly far enough &ndash; Bibs should be a full blown easy-clean\
      \ body bag with two holes for the kids eyes, and one hole to put the food into.\
      \  I'm not sure about they eye holes actually &ndash; if they can't see what\
      \ they are eating it might take them longer to tell you they don't like it.\
      \  My two ''honeys'' will quite happily smear food all over their face, the\
      \ table, the floor, and the chair they are sitting on.  In fact, anything they\
      \ can reach is guaranteed to get a generous coating of half masticated goo.\
      \  If there's anything they can't reach then the spray from their mouths as\
      \ they talk while eating will do the job.  My ''honeys'' are able to turn weak\
      \ stomached adults green in seconds at meal times.  And send unwary visitors\
      \ scurrying for cover and the full body radiation suits we keep in the cloak\
      \ room.\n\nI could still go on ... I've not mentioned the gradual destruction\
      \ of my belongings, the fighting, whining, moaning or whinging.  The constant,\
      \ wearing lack of a continuous nights sleep.  The incessant background noise\
      \ .... there's still more I could write about....\n\nI guess by this time you\
      \ are wondering why I agreed (I was always a bit reluctant and cagey) to have\
      \ kids in the first place.  Well, to be honest, I was lied to.  Not one single\
      \ person told me the truth about what having kids was like.  They all said,\
      \ \"Well, it's a bit of a change of life, but it's great fun and very rewarding.\"\
      .  If murder was legal I'd be hunting them down right now.  The only possible\
      \ reason I can see for the lies is to ensure that I became as miserable as they\
      \ are.  They obviously felt I was too happy in my child-free life.  And because\
      \ of these lies I just ran out of excuses, and gave in to the wife's \"I want\
      \ kids\" demand.  What I should have done was either left or refused.\n\nBut\
      \ the very worst thing about kids is that once you've got them, and you realise\
      \ what a hideous mistake it was, it's too late.  You can't take them back to\
      \ the store as faulty goods.  They become a permanent part of your life, sucking\
      \ the cash out of your wallet faster and more effectively than even the wife\
      \ can manage.\n\nSo, you still want to have kids?  What part of '''\"don't do\
      \ it! &ndash; run away!\"''' didn't you understand?\n\n'''Disclaimer:'''  I\
      \ love my kids to bits - it's the only reason they are still alive.  However,\
      \ '''all''' of the above comments have far more truth to them than you would\
      \ think.  There are some good sides to having kids though &ndash; I'll write\
      \ them down here when I work out what they are.\n\n''The above text is not to\
      \ be reproduced without permission.''\n\n----\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  sounds fun.\
      \ I'll swap you ;)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''  For what exactly?  Or do you like\
      \ getting up early?\n\n:'''Tarquin:'''  For what? You don't want to know. I\
      \ tend to be nocturnal so getting up early would mean a big routine shift. I'd\
      \ probably end up having my \"nocturnal\" moments around 5am. It all sounds\
      \ like hell, but it's not putting me off. A boy can get broody you know. As\
      \ for the early morning call, here's a tip from my parents: they taught me how\
      \ to read the hour hand on the clock, and said I was to play in my room & not\
      \ to wake them up until it reached a certain angle. Apparently it worked, but\
      \ then again I had a really good jigaw puzzle of a steam engine that kept me\
      \ occupied for hours on end.\n\n'''Dma:'''  I am 22 (last time I checked) and\
      \ haven't been married.  I haven't even been on anything close to resembling\
      \ a date.  I don't really have a social life.  You make me even more certain\
      \ that I made the right choices.  :-D\n\n'''Bean:''' This has further confirmed\
      \ my decision to not have kids. :p\n\n'''Wang:'''  I can pretty much confirm\
      \ all of the above (even though I \"only\" have 1 little \"spirited\" 2 year\
      \ old boy) (for \"spirited\" read: if you take your eyes off him for a second\
      \ he'll be diving off the sofa, climbing the kitchen table, reprogramming all\
      \ the radio stations on the hifi, spreading chocolate over the remote controls\
      \ and generally running everywhere as fast as he possibly can with complete\
      \ dis-regard for personal safety).\n\nI have not been able to stay in bed beyond\
      \ 8.00 a.m. for two years now (literally). I have been able to stay up all night\
      \ wiping his nose on numerous occasions. I am unable to get within 2m of my\
      \ pc while he is up unless I am prepared to deal with the mother of all tantrums.\
      \ Whilst he may appear to be playing happily with his latest favourite toy,\
      \ he is merely patiently waiting to deny me any possibility of \"personal time\"\
      .\n\nHowever, the good points: Toys. I can now relive my childhood and buy the\
      \ new versions of all the toys I remember. Just bought him a toy motorbike with\
      \ a friction motor (it's not meant for a 2 year old but I'm sure he'll grow\
      \ into it :) ). The downside to this is he seems to have the same taste in toys\
      \ as me, since I can't get anywhere near it without screams of \"mine\".\n\n\
      Despite all this though he means everything to me. If he's happy I'm happy.\
      \ We had family over this weekend and watched the videos we have taken of him.\
      \ Just made me want to pick him up love him to bits. The family didn't seem\
      \ to get it though (\"can we fast forward this?\" \"What this bit!!???, But\
      \ he's about to roll over!!!!\"). I reckon it's a chemical imbalance parents\
      \ have to prevent them from throttling their kids.\n\nQuote:\n\n\"The rest of\
      \ the room in the house is taken up by stuff relating to kids. Nappies, wife,\
      \ and toys.\" Assuming that is a spelling mistake and it should read \"wife\"\
      , I sure hope she never gets to see this page or you'll wish you were never\
      \ born :)\n\nFor Dma, whilst I can't in all honesty recommend the kids bit the\
      \ stuff before that can be fun :)\n\n'''NFG:''' I love this page,...think Entropic\
      \ should become a MAJOR comedian. Anyway, I thought I'd add some frightening\
      \ real-life Intel on what my 2 year old nephew was like (Incredibly, he's still\
      \ alive).\n\nOccasionally, I'd visit my sister and brother-in-laws' house to\
      \ terrorize the kids (she has two, both very bright and very funny, about grammar\
      \ school age). My nephew's name is Kyle, and he was just fascinated with (obssessed\
      \ by actually) large mobile equipment transport and huge trucks. His idea of\
      \ fun was to run out in the road when a cement mixer or humongeous construction\
      \ crane was driving along, stand DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH, and yell some thing like,\
      \ \"Look at that Humongeous truck!\" He would actually laugh when three or four\
      \ frantic and terrified adults would race out into the road and save him from\
      \ a grizzly death. He was absolutely FEARLESS. Scared the hell out me. After\
      \ that, I never let him get beyond arm's length from me. And, he attempted this\
      \ ALL THE TIME. HE WAS A COMPLETE MANIAC. He'd just scream excitedly, and try\
      \ to run out into the road. When we were out in public, I always made him wear\
      \ an expedition-style, heavily re-inforced shirt, and, had to pay to replace\
      \ these on a regular basis.\n\nI think if I were actually his Father, I would\
      \ have made him wear a climbing harness at all times, to which numerous industrial-strength\
      \ elastic bungee-cords and nylon ropes, rated to withstand the fall of a horse\
      \ at 100 feet, were attached . These would then be attached to major concrete\
      \ structures with nautical winches. \n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''  Hee hee.  My eldest\
      \ daughter likes to do the ''run off at high speed into mortal peril'' trick\
      \ every now and then.  We do have a harness for her, but the threat of a ''clip\
      \ round the ear'' can also be very effective.  I really need to tweak the main\
      \ content of the page.  There's a few typos in there and whole paragraphs missing.\
      \  Hey ''Wang'' &ndash; how do you manage to get them to stay in bed till 8am?\
      \  That sounds like heaven.  Heck, even getting them to sleep in to 7am would\
      \ be like heaven for me.\n\n'''Wang:''' Well despite the fact he is 2 he still\
      \ sleeps in a cot with sides so he can't get out. He could feasibly climb out\
      \ now but we use an infant sleeping bag that sufficiently restricts his leg\
      \ movement that he can barely get to a standing position :) He is a nightmare\
      \ to get to sleep though often staying awake till 9pm which is probably what\
      \ causes him to sleep in \"late\". We have now devised the clever plan of having\
      \ mine and my wifes pc in the conservatory. Full double glazing completely drowns\
      \ out all screams from upstairs :p\n\n'''Kerlin:''' You have lots to look forward\
      \ to, though. When they're 4 or 5 they get their own juicebox in the morning.\
      \ And now at 9, the kid's making her own breakfast (bagel and cereal)...and\
      \ microwave popcorn. She made a grilled cheese sandwich with her mom the other\
      \ day. Enjoy it while you can cause they grow up fast. Ahhh christ, now I sound\
      \ like my parents. I gotta get out of here... '':)''\n\n----\n\n'''Aphex:'''\
      \ Oh crap.\n\n'''Aphex:''' Ah well, kid is now 2 yrs old, and just getting naughty\
      \ (that is, more naughty than before)  Should have read this page more thoroughly\
      \ I think.  Wife is suggesting another one.  Am considering becoming Tibetian\
      \ monk to avoid.  Suggestions? ;)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' Hi M8 good to hear from\
      \ you.  Has it really been two years?  That's the problem with getting older\
      \ - you blink and a year passes by.  Stop to cough and splutter a bit and suddenly\
      \ your half a decade older.  My two (5 and 6 this year) do actually play very\
      \ nicely together most of the time.  The rest of the time they are either wailing\
      \ and crying or trying to kill each other.  Be warned that having two offspring\
      \ running around the place is more than twice as much work as having one.  To\
      \ be honest if the wife is suggesting it you're probably doomed and you might\
      \ as well give in sooner rather than later as she'll get her own way in the\
      \ end anyway.  I was kind of lucky in that having two was so much work that\
      \ the wife didn't want any more (she originally wanted three).\n\n'''T1:'''\
      \ 2 kids closer in age get along better because they have similar interests\
      \ and can't hurt each other as much. But if the age difference is bigger, like\
      \ 13 years or so, then the older one is usually responsible enough not to hurt\
      \ the little one. But the little one will probably be an annoying pain in the\
      \ ass to the older one.\n\n'''Aphex:''' Yeah Entropic - good to see you're still\
      \ around.  Yours are 5 & 6 already!? I know what you mean - time IS flying!!\
      \ :(  I'll get the wife to read this I think, but yes... probably doomed lol\
      \  ;)\n\n----\n\n'''Bob_The_Beheader:''' I've heard that a parent is someone\
      \ who gets up in the middle of the night to see why their child is crying. A\
      \ parent is also someone who gets up in the middle of the night to see why thier\
      \ child is not crying. You kinda have to be a parent or know children well to\
      \ get this, but I bet you get it Entropic. :)\n[[Category:Legacy Rant|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
