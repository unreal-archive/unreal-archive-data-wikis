      \ Design Principles\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>General design principles help to solidify ideas and give structure to mappers\
      \ with only a vague idea. On the macro-level, these principles help to organize\
      \ the most important ideas, but they can also serve to help with the decisions\
      \ made for every detail. A design is a set of answers to the open-ended questions\
      \ these principles pose.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Theme\">Theme</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Map_Design?section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Theme\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The theme of a map\
      \ is a combination of the setting and circumstances that make this map unique.\
      \ A map's theme can be any well-defined circumstances that influence other elements\
      \ and principles of the design in a consistent way. Most decisions made should\
      \ be based on theme. The theme is <b>what</b> the map seems to present to the\
      \ player.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Style\">Style</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Map_Design?section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Style\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The style of any\
      \ art makes it distinctive. For successful design, the style becomes a consistent\
      \ way the various elements are communicated to the player. Style will carry\
      \ from one element, aspect or detail of the design to another in similar ways.\
      \ The style is <b>how</b> the map presents itself to the player.</p>\n<h3><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Balance\">Balance</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\
      ><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Map_Design?section=4\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Balance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Balance is an important principle to be aware of in\
      \ design. It should not always suggest perfect balance (which tends to be aesthetically\
      \ boring), but instead should suggest an awareness of the balance between various\
      \ elements. A map called, \"King of the Hill\", may indeed require a highly\
      \ fortified central hill that would seem to throw the map's balance off, but\
      \ it would be necessary. The balance of a map refers to the predictable climate\
      \ the player will find themself in.</p>\n<p>See also <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Variation is an essential design principle. Without\
      \ variation, the player will experience less and have less to act upon or think\
      \ about. Variation works only when there is some patten or rhythm to vary against,\
      \ perhaps even a consistent Theme, Style or Balance. Variation is what suprises\
      \ the player; it's the subject of discovery.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >Architecture</a>, is the term used to describe the overall shape of the map\
      \ as well as the detailed interconnections between areas. A layout is the simple\

      <p>Placement of elements within the layout becomes crucial for popular gameplay.\
      \ PlayerStarts, Weapons, Items, and even Decoration and Lights, all need proper\
      \ placement to appeal to the player. PlayerStart, Weapon, Item, and <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:GameObjective\" title=\"Legacy:GameObjective\">GameObjective</a> placement\
      \ is governed by the guideline of Risk vs Reward; the idea that for every risk\

      \ or some other highly desireable item you want to place in your map should\
      \ be in the most open, visible, and exposed spot you can find. Alternately,\
      \ it could be hidden from view and difficult to get to. It should be a risk\
      \ to get there, and double the risk to get back. A fine example of this is the\
      \ shield-belt and damage-amp chamber in DM-Pressure.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>See also\

      \ includes the decorative items added to support theme and style, it also includes\
      \ the decorative features and details of the architecture, particle work, skyboxes,\
      \ etc. When used consistently through a map, decoration helps to give the player\

      \ and walkways and on staircases. Trim can now come in mesh format as well,\

      \ is a critical element to communicating to the player. Without light, the player\
      \ has lost half their senses. Each opportunity to shine light on the details\
      \ of the design is a communication to the player. Red or Blue lights talk about\
      \ Team sides, a red flashing light warns of a hazard, a small spotlight beaming\
      \ down on a spot in the layout beckons players to go there.</p>\n<p>See also\

      <p>The other half of the player's senses is hearing; and as crucial as it is,\
      \ sound is forgotten more often than not. The sound in a map usually isn't noticed\
      \ until it's not there. It's a very powerful tool to manipulate perception.\
      \ Working in tandem with light, the player will have support for the visual\
      \ communication, making things seem more real. While sound working in contrast\
      \ or discord with light, can make the players feel disengaged, disoriented or\
      \ anxious.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Create_sound_cues\">Create\

      <dl>\n<dd>Use sounds to give away player locations. Make each lift on the map\
      \ sound slightly different. That way a player will know when he uses a lift\
      \ his opponent will know exactly where he is. Health vials, jump boots, and\
      \ other objects that make a distinctive sound can be used to place players at\
      \ certain points on the map. Shallow pools of water are also good for this.\
      \ Effective use of sound cues can make a 1-on-1 match turn into an intense tactical\
      \ battle as each player tries to outmaneuver the other based upon where they\
      \ hear the opponent, rather than where they see their opponent.</dd>\n</dl>\n\

      <p>Bot support is an essential element of map design, especially if the map\

      \ place-holders in servers, often bots are the only opponents a player can find\

      \ the mapper to create the support system all bot players expect. The goal of\
      \ good botplay design is to allow the player to forget their bot opponent is\

    text: "{{innerbox| ''Since this page is the single most frequently spammed page\
      \ on our wiki (whyever that may be), we've locked it for the time being.  If\
      \ you'd like to add anything to it, please leave a note on [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Discussion]].\n\
      \n}}\n\n'''Map Design''', like any design, is essentially an art.  It is a personal\
      \ creation by the designer that attempts to communicate with their audience.\
      \  The designer works like any other artist, to attract their audience for the\
      \ purpose of further discovery.\n\nDesign for Unreal maps focuses on elements\
      \ that appeal to the player and that entice the player to explore the map.\n\
      \n==Design Principles==\n\nGeneral design principles help to solidify ideas\
      \ and give structure to mappers with only a vague idea.  On the macro-level,\
      \ these principles help to organize the most important ideas, but they can also\
      \ serve to help with the decisions made for every detail.  A design is a set\
      \ of answers to the open-ended questions these principles pose.\n\n===Theme===\n\
      \nThe theme of a map is a combination of the setting and circumstances that\
      \ make this map unique.  A map's theme can be any well-defined circumstances\
      \ that influence other elements and principles of the design in a consistent\
      \ way.  Most decisions made should be based on theme.  The theme is '''what'''\
      \ the map seems to present to the player.\n\n===Style===\n\nThe style of any\
      \ art makes it distinctive.  For successful design, the style becomes a consistent\
      \ way the various elements are communicated to the player.  Style will carry\
      \ from one element, aspect or detail of the design to another in similar ways.\
      \  The style is '''how''' the map presents itself to the player.\n\n===Balance===\n\
      \nBalance is an important principle to be aware of in design.  It should not\
      \ always suggest perfect balance (which tends to be aesthetically boring), but\
      \ instead should suggest an awareness of the balance between various elements.\
      \  A map called, \"King of the Hill\", may indeed require a highly fortified\
      \ central hill that would seem to throw the map's balance off, but it would\
      \ be necessary.  The balance of a map refers to the predictable climate the\
      \ player will find themself in.\n\nSee also [http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=39310\
      \ Balance vs. Imbalance : An Essay About Strategy] by Blitz. \n\n===Variation===\n\
      \nVariation is an essential design principle.  Without variation, the player\
      \ will experience less and have less to act upon or think about.  Variation\
      \ works only when there is some patten or rhythm to vary against, perhaps even\
      \ a consistent Theme, Style or Balance.  Variation is what suprises the player;\
      \ it's the subject of discovery.\n\n====Break Up Surfaces====\n:Try not to let\
      \ any surface be plain, add some indents, some meshes, maybe a few walking gorillas\
      \ if you have to, but a plain map is a failure, even if it has good flow not\
      \ many will play it.\n\n==Mapping Elements==\n\nThese mapping elements are common\
      \ terms in Unreal mapping.  They represent the framework for all map design.\
      \  By defining these terms, mappers gain a toolbox of ideas they can implement.\
      \  \n\n===Layout===\n\nLayout, sometimes referred to as Map [[Legacy:Architecture|Architecture]],\
      \ is the term used to describe the overall shape of the map as well as the detailed\
      \ interconnections between areas.  A layout is the simple \"floor plan\" of\
      \ the map: how many rooms?, how big is this space?,  where do these paths lead?,\
      \ etc.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Map Flow|Map Flow]].\n\n===Placement===\n\nPlacement\
      \ of elements within the layout becomes crucial for popular gameplay.  PlayerStarts,\
      \ Weapons, Items, and even Decoration and Lights, all need proper placement\
      \ to appeal to the player.  PlayerStart, Weapon, Item, and [[Legacy:GameObjective|GameObjective]]\
      \ placement is governed by the guideline of Risk vs Reward; the idea that for\
      \ every risk a player takes, there is a reward of equal value.\n\n====Risk vs\
      \ Reward====\n: As famously expounded by CliffyB, ''\"Put desirable things in\
      \ a dangerous or exposed spot.\"''.  The Keg of Health or some other highly\
      \ desireable item you want to place in your map should be in the most open,\
      \ visible, and exposed spot you can find.  Alternately, it could be hidden from\
      \ view and difficult to get to.  It should be a risk to get there, and double\
      \ the risk to get back.  A fine example of this is the shield-belt and damage-amp\
      \ chamber in DM-Pressure.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Placing PlayerStart|Placing PlayerStart]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Inventory Item Placement|Inventory Item Placement]].\n\n===Decoration===\n\
      \nDecoration serves to support the player's suspension of disbelief and to draw\
      \ the player into the environment.  Decoration not only includes the decorative\
      \ items added to support theme and style, it also includes the decorative features\
      \ and details of the architecture, particle work, skyboxes, etc.  When used\
      \ consistently through a map, decoration helps to give the player a sense that\
      \ the experience is real.\n\n====Edge Trim====\n: This is an example of a nice\
      \ detail leading to an overall graphically pleasing map. A trimmed edge is where\
      \ you put a different texture (preferably a different colour and a plain one)\
      \ on the edge of the original texture, i.e. at the floor-wall corners, at the\
      \ edge of ramps and walkways and on staircases. Trim can now come in mesh format\
      \ as well, for example DM-Plunge, every surface that has that weird light holder\
      \ has trim, and it looks so much better.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Building With\
      \ Static Meshes|Building With Static Meshes]] and [[Legacy:Texture Topics|Texture\
      \ Topics]].\n\n===Lighting===\n\nLighting is a critical element to communicating\
      \ to the player.  Without light, the player has lost half their senses.  Each\
      \ opportunity to shine light on the details of the design is a communication\
      \ to the player.  Red or Blue lights talk about Team sides, a red flashing light\
      \ warns of a hazard, a small spotlight beaming down on a spot in the layout\
      \ beckons players to go there.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Lighting|Lighting]], [[Legacy:Lighting\
      \ Basics|Lighting Basics]] and [[Legacy:Lighting Strategies|Lighting Strategies]].\n\
      \n===Sound===\n\nThe other half of the player's senses is hearing; and as crucial\
      \ as it is, sound is forgotten more often than not.  The sound in a map usually\
      \ isn't noticed until it's not there.  It's a very powerful tool to manipulate\
      \ perception.  Working in tandem with light, the player will have support for\
      \ the visual communication, making things seem more real.  While sound working\
      \ in contrast or discord with light, can make the players feel disengaged, disoriented\
      \ or anxious.\n\n====Create sound cues ====\n: Use sounds to give away player\
      \ locations.  Make each lift on the map sound slightly different.  That way\
      \ a player will know when he uses a lift his opponent will know exactly where\
      \ he is.  Health vials, jump boots, and other objects that make a distinctive\
      \ sound can be used to place players at certain points on the map.  Shallow\
      \ pools of water are also good for this.  Effective use of sound cues can make\
      \ a 1-on-1 match turn into an intense tactical battle as each player tries to\
      \ outmaneuver the other based upon where they hear the opponent, rather than\
      \ where they see their opponent.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:AmbientSound|AmbientSound]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Triggering Sounds|Triggering Sounds]].\n\n===Bot Support===\n\
      \nBot support is an essential element of map design, especially if the map is\
      \ to be released to the public.  Sometimes bots are used simply as player place-holders\
      \ in servers, often bots are the only opponents a player can find for a custom\
      \ map.  Bots need help to act like real players.  It is the job of the mapper\
      \ to create the support system all bot players expect.  The goal of good botplay\
      \ design is to allow the player to forget their bot opponent is not a human\
      \ player.\n\nSee also [[Legacy:Bot Support|Bot Support]].\n\n==External Links==\n\
