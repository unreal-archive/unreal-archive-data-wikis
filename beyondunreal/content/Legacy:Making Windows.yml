      <p>Open UnrealEd, import the texture you just created. You can import it into\
      \ any package, but the \"MyLevel\" package is good, as it will cause the materials\
      \ to be stored inside the level, so it will be easier to distribute your map.</p>\n\
      <p>Now you have to create a reflective material. Choose <i>File</i> -&gt; <i>New</i>\
      \ and pick <b>Combiner</b> in the combo list. You can use any name you want\
      \ for the material.</p>\n<p>In the combiner's properties, set the first material\
      \ to your use your glass texture. For the second material, use a <b>TexEnvMap</b>.\
      \ Ideally it should match your level, but it won't be overly clear anyway so\
      \ it needn't match exactly. There are a lot of these in CubeMaps.utx, or you\
      \ can create your own. For the combiners operation, select <b>CO_Alphablend_With_Mask</b>\
      \ from the <i>CombineOperation</i> combo list. The mask material defines the\
      \ way the two material will blend. Use the glass texture once again (since it\
      \ contains an alpha channel). You may have to set <b>InvertMask</b> to <i>true</i>.\
      \ You should experiment with both settings to see which gives you the effect\
      \ you desire.</p>\n<p>Now we need to make a translucent version of that material.\
      \ Create a new material, a <b>Shader</b>. Use the <i>combiner</i> you just created\
      \ for the <b>Diffuse</b> slot and the glass texture for the <b>Opacity slot</b>.</p>\n\

      \ package.</p>\n<p>Now you have a ready-to-use window. You can still resize\
      \ it with the <b>DrawScale3D</b> fields. Changes made to the static mesh will\

      \ to something around <i>64</i> in the <i>Display</i> properties of your static\
