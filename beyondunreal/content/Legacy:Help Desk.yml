      \ There is a function in LevelInfo called GetLocalPlayerController. It can be\
      \ accessed using Level.GetLocalPlayerController. This will return the clients\
      \ player controller. From there you simply need to get the location of the pawn.\
      \ This will work wonders if it'll be used offline. The problems might start\

      <p><b>Hellborg:</b> UT3, I would like to modify the standard postprocess (DOFAndBloomBlendPixelShader)\
      \ used in Unreal Tournament 3. In the UT3 tech based Roboblitz I can simply\
      \ edit the postprocess by directly editing the file DOFAndBloomBlendPixelShader.usf\
      \ in the Engine/Shaders folder with notepad. I then simply remove the shadercache,\
      \ run roboblitz, and the new shadercode is used. I can thereby implement cartoon\
      \ shading in roboblitz. I tried the same with UT3, deleted the shadercashe (files\
      \ RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM2.upk,RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM3.upk and RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM4.upk\
      \ and edited DOFAndBloomBlendPixelShader.usf in notepad. However, the game gives\
      \ a runtime error on startup even after the tiniest change in the shader script.\
      \ I am sure,that the shader code is still fine - just changing a single constant\
      \ produces this error. There is also no information given by the error message.\
      \ Do I need to change certain configuration files to allow modified shader script,\
      \ or is there a more general problem with my method in UT3? Or, is there a more\
      \ elegant way to add a custom postprocess to the whole game scene? I asked this\
      \ question in many formus already, but nobody seems to have a clue...</p>\n\

      \ been working for quite some time trying to figure out how to simulate weapons\
      \ having weight. The idea being that if you were holding a gun in your hand,\
      \ it would slow you down by some arbitrary amount. But if you changed that gun\
      \ out for another one you'd speed back up again. Over the past several days\
      \ I've hit several dead ends in trying to do this. Currently I'm thinking that\
      \ I'm going to need to put a timer on somthing and then find a way to check\
      \ if the characters are holding the gun, perhaps on the pawn that might be using\
      \ the weapon. I can't seem to find a good page explaing (this is my first mutator\
      \ ever) how timers work, and what functions might close them. I read on the\
      \ inventory class page discription that timers are unmade in some functions.\
      \ If I try to put a timer on a pawn, will it get erased after the pawn dies,\
      \ or some other event that I may not realize? If so, I'll have to recrete the\
      \ timer everytime the pawn spawns, I guess via ModifyPlayer().</p>\n<p>Is using\
      \ a timer really the best way to do this? I'm still trying to find a function\
      \ on weapon or inventory that might trigger when a weapon is being readied or\
      \ unreadied, but in the past few days I've not been able to find anything worked.\
      \ I've also not been able to find a pre-existing mutator code that makes somthing\
      \ happen when the player is holding a weapon, so I've got nothing to experiment\
      \ with.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> I suggest that instead of using the mutator\

      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> I have a Pawn class that is updated (Physics, Location,\
      \ Rotation, AnimSequence &amp; Anim frame) on Clients only when the Player has\
      \ a line of sight to it. Since this Pawn is prone (not moving, not animating),\
      \ there is no reason for the bNetDirty to update this Actor. Is there a simple\
      \ way to make sure this Pawn is properly updated <b>before</b> the Player sees\
      \ it?</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Is this question clear enough? Anyone have a\
      \ suggestion, solution or comment on this problem?</p>\n<p><b>Graphik:</b> You've\
      \ not properly explained what you're trying to accomplish or how you're trying\
      \ to do it.</p>\n<p>In case I've mentally translated your unworkable description\
      \ into something partway logical: How is your code going to guess when the Player\
      \ is about to change his line of sight so as to 'properly update before the\
      \ player sees it'?</p>\n<p><b>EricBlade:</b> I would guess off hand that actually\
      \ doing all this checking for line of sights is probably more costly than just\
      \ letting the regular relevance code do what it's supposed to do?</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ Thank you. What I mean by updating before the player sees it, is to make a\
      \ <i>one-time</i> forced update (from the default setting of a property, which\
      \ the Client has automatically, to the setting this prone Pawn should have on\
      \ the Server), perhaps at map start. For example, my Pawn should be set to PHYS_None\
      \ (because of a special state it is in), but the default is PHYS_Falling. On\
      \ the server this Physics special setting is known, on the Client it is not\
      \ (until the Client machine gets an update from the Server). So, as it is now,\
      \ the Player on the Client turns a corner, sees the Pawn, the Pawn falls (PHYS_Falling),\
      \ then after a moment, it updates the Pawn's location, rotation, and Physics,\
      \ and the Pawn *snaps* back to where it should be. My question is related to\
      \ this example. How can I force this Pawn to update the Physics setting in time\
      \ to prevent it from falling when the Client Player sees it? As of yet, I do\
      \ not have a workable solution. It appears to me to be a limitation of the Replication\
      \ scheme. But, I thought I bring the problem up here, in case anyone would like\
      \ to help me find a solution.</p>\n<p><b>Graphik:</b> Your expanded description\
      \ still leaves me guessing, but I recommend you use the ModifyPlayer function.\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator\" title=\"Legacy:Mutator\">Mutator</a> features\
      \ a description of the function as well as an example of its use.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ My suspicion is that this is not something that Graphik can help me with.\
      \ <i>(No offense, Graphik)</i> But I will try to elaborate one point that appears\
      \ to have been missed. Replication, as Unreal uses it by default, causes the\
      \ above example situation automatically, where the Pawn as it exists on the\
      \ Client gets an update to important non-default settings on properties such\
      \ as Physics only after the Client Player has seen it. Unreal Replication is\
      \ able to handle elaborate maps because it does not replicate everything all\
      \ the time, only the bare minimum that's needed, when it's needed, to <i>simulate</i>\
      \ what's happening on the Server. This example I've described above shows that\
      \ scheme in action, but I am looking for a clever workaround to somehow force\
      \ this Client Pawn to update either instantly (when the Client Player sees it)\
      \ perhaps do something that will ensure the Client Pawn is already set to the\
      \ proper (not the default) Physics setting before this line of sight occurs.\
      \ The goal would be to avoid the situation where the Client Players see this\
      \ Pawn fall and then snap back to the proper location a moment later (depending\
      \ on current netspeed conditions). IOW, I have not coded some nifty line of\
      \ sight stuff, this is just how Unreal Replication works now. I'm looking for\
      \ some kind of override, so the Client Pawn does not rely on it's default property\
      \ setting. I would consider whatever workaround works, and use it on other properties\
      \ as well, such as Animation-related properties, etc.</p>\n<p><b>EricBlade:</b>\
      \ bAlwaysRelevant&#160;?</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> I thought about that. It seemed\
      \ like overkill for a prone Pawn, but at the moment that appears to be the only\
      \ working idea I've run across. I'm also not sure how well that property works,\
      \ being switched on/off, which I would want to do if this Pawn is in it's special\
      \ state, and when it leaves it and should act more like a normal Pawn on Clients.\
      \ Thanks for the idea.&#160;:) Hopefully a more economical idea can be found\
      \ as well.</p>\n<p><b>EricBlade:</b> Seems like months since I last looked at\
      \ this page, but it should probably work pretty well - if you set it bAlwaysRelevant,\
      \ and it's not doing anything, it shouldn't cause any major changes in net traffic,\
      \ as it'll do it's replication stuff when the player connects, but then otherwise\
      \ it isn't doing anything. As far as I can tell, setting bAlwaysRelevant on\
      \ and off works pretty well - I've seen several Land of the Dead maps that have\
      \ used a Security Camera type thing, but had to install a volume that makes\
      \ whatever enters it bAlwaysRelevant, so that you could monitor things in a\
      \ remote room (pawns would not be relevant halfway across the map, so you couldn't\
      \ see them on remote cameras)</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> I'm guessing you've\
      \ solved this problem by now. But, wouldn't it be possible to use the bAlwaysRelevant\
      \ flag with an inventory object? It seems like a really ugly hack work around\
      \ to me ... just an off the wall idea. It's probably crazy though.</p>\n<h3><span\

      <p>I having a problem with replication. For the past 2 weeks all I have been\
      \ doing is researching it and nothing can barely explain it. I understand some\
      \ of it, or at least I think I do. No replication I make works, at all, in any\
      \ cases. It is just getting to me too much, how it simply does not work.</p>\n\
      <p>Anyways I wrote this script. Remember, some coding in this may seem \"noobish\"\
      \ but this is just practice for me you could say. What it does is when this\
      \ item is added to your inventory, it takes the value of an array in another\
      \ actor. The variable is called LastPlayed. This value is not replicated to\
      \ the client. So what I'm trying to do here is (since I cant replicate a variable\
      \ that exists in another actor I didnt make) is assign the value of LastPlayed\
      \ to ClientIP and then replicate ClientIP over to the client where they process\
      \ it.</p>\n<p>Here is the class...</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code\

      \ One way would be changing the InputClass in Engine.PlayerController to your\
      \ class extending PlayerInput and possibly adding hooking functions there (or\
      \ simply do it easier by changing them directly in Engine.PlayerController).\
      \ The reason I told you to use an Input class is that the input moments are\
      \ best accessed in the PlayerInput ticking event, therefore you need to do it\
      \ there. This was doing a quick skimming of the UT2kX code so it is not guaranteed\

      \ is this at all possible, or are all native functions final. Are native functions\
      \ with the same name as script functions considered different because they dont\
      \ have the same number?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> You can override UnrealScript\
      \ functions declared as native, if they are not final. (Many are, but not all.)\
      \ However, the function you have indicated does not have a corresponding UnrealScript\
      \ function, so you cannot override it with UnrealScript. There is probrably\
      \ an UnrealScript function that you can override to get the same result as you\
      \ are trying to achieve.</p>\n<p><b>Baz:</b> oh well, my problem is that bIsInverted\
      \ is set and checked in the native code, and if bIsInverted is true a vehicle\
      \ wont reverse when its are upsidedown. Ive got a scorpian driving on the celing,\
      \ but when you drive into a corner you cant drive out again.</p>\n<p><b>Nobody:</b>\
      \ I don't know the code you are refering to, but can you intercept it when the\
      \ user attempts reverse and check to see if bIsInverted=true and if so set vehicle's\
      \ rotation 180º from current? If you do that in increments, maybe a for loop,\
      \ then it might feel like it is some automatic feature of the vehicle, and not\
      \ some funky hack of the game, like driving on the ceiling hehehehe just kiddin'.</p>\n\

      \ Engine.Console, Engine.Inventory, Engine.HUD (and subclasses obviously)</p>\n\
      <p>Native: (apart from the above) Engine.Player, Engine.SubSystem, Engine.Client,\
      \ Engine.Engine, Engine.GameInfo, Engine.Input, Engine.Level (NOT ENGINE.LEVELINFO),\
      \ and of course, all their subclasses...</p>\n<p>It isn't as simple as subclassing\
      \ PlayerPawn and that's it... you need to subclass a proper player controller\
      \ subclass (namely something like TMale1 or TMale2 which are children of TournamentPlayer\
      \ which is a child class of PlayerPawn) and then insert them in the game with\
      \ a mutator by hooking Engine.Mutator.ModifyLogin()</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b>\
      \ Well I'm pretty sure PlayerPawn DOES work with exec functions but as you said,\
      \ you DO have to get it into the game somehow. If you created a class and put\
      \ an exec function in it and thats it, its like... er... trying to use a coffee\
      \ maker thats still in the car. You have to take it out of the car, i.e. have\
      \ the player take 'control' of the PlayerPawn, take the coffeemaker out of the\
      \ box and use it, i.e. Call the exec function on that PlayerPawn. If the player\
      \ doesn't have control of the PlayerPawn when you call the exec function, then\
      \ engine gives you the \"unrecognized command\" because it really doesn't know\
      \ that command even exists.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      ===Editing Shaders ===\n\n'''Hellborg:''' UT3, I would like to modify the standard\
      \ postprocess (DOFAndBloomBlendPixelShader) used in Unreal Tournament 3. In\
      \ the UT3 tech based Roboblitz I can simply edit the postprocess by directly\
      \ editing the file DOFAndBloomBlendPixelShader.usf in the Engine/Shaders folder\
      \ with notepad. I then simply remove the shadercache, run roboblitz, and the\
      \ new shadercode is used. I can thereby implement cartoon shading in roboblitz.\
      \ I tried the same with UT3, deleted the shadercashe (files RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM2.upk,RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM3.upk\
      \ and RefShaderCache-PC-D3D-SM4.upk and edited DOFAndBloomBlendPixelShader.usf\
      \ in notepad. However, the game gives a runtime error on startup even after\
      \ the tiniest change in the shader script. I am sure,that the shader code is\
      \ still fine - just changing a single constant produces this error. There is\
      \ also no information given by the error message. Do I need to change certain\
      \ configuration files to allow modified shader script, or is there a more general\
      \ problem with my method in UT3? Or, is there a more elegant way to add a custom\
      \ postprocess to the whole game scene? I asked this question in many formus\
      \ already, but nobody seems to have a clue...\n\n===Third Person View ===\n\n\

      \ Slowing Down Player When Holding It===\n\n'''Fey''':  I've been working for\
      \ quite some time trying to figure out how to simulate weapons having weight.\
      \  The idea being that if you were holding a gun in your hand, it would slow\
      \ you down by some arbitrary amount.  But if you changed that gun out for another\
      \ one you'd speed back up again.  Over the past several days I've hit several\
      \ dead ends in trying to do this.  Currently I'm thinking that I'm going to\
      \ need to put a timer on somthing and then find a way to check if the characters\
      \ are holding the gun, perhaps on the pawn that might be using the weapon. \
      \ I can't seem to find a good page explaing (this is my first mutator ever)\
      \ how timers work, and what functions might close them.  I read on the inventory\
      \ class page discription that timers are unmade in some functions.  If I try\
      \ to put a timer on a pawn, will it get erased after the pawn dies, or some\
      \ other event that I may not realize?  If so, I'll have to recrete the timer\
      \ everytime the pawn spawns, I guess via ModifyPlayer().  \n\nIs using a timer\
      \ really the best way to do this?  I'm still trying to find a function on weapon\
      \ or inventory that might trigger when a weapon is being readied or unreadied,\
      \ but in the past few days I've not been able to find anything worked.  I've\
      \ also not been able to find a pre-existing mutator code that makes somthing\
      \ happen when the player is holding a weapon, so I've got nothing to experiment\
      \ with.\n\n'''MythOpus:'''  I suggest that instead of using the mutator to do\
      \ the guts of what you're trying to do, use an [[Legacy:Interaction|Interaction]]\

      \ update for \"prone\" Pawn===\n\n'''SuperApe:''' I have a Pawn class that is\
      \ updated (Physics, Location, Rotation, AnimSequence & Anim frame) on Clients\
      \ only when the Player has a line of sight to it.  Since this Pawn is prone\
      \ (not moving, not animating), there is no reason for the bNetDirty to update\
      \ this Actor.  Is there a simple way to make sure this Pawn is properly updated\
      \ '''before''' the Player sees it?\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Is this question clear\
      \ enough?  Anyone have a suggestion, solution or comment on this problem?\n\n\
      '''Graphik:''' You've not properly explained what you're trying to accomplish\
      \ or how you're trying to do it.\n\nIn case I've mentally translated your unworkable\
      \ description into something partway logical: How is your code going to guess\
      \ when the Player is about to change his line of sight so as to 'properly update\
      \ before the player sees it'?\n\n'''EricBlade:''' I would guess off hand that\
      \ actually doing all this checking for line of sights is probably more costly\
      \ than just letting the regular relevance code do what it's supposed to do?\n\
      \n'''SuperApe:''' Thank you.  What I mean by updating before the player sees\
      \ it, is to make a ''one-time'' forced update (from the default setting of a\
      \ property, which the Client has automatically, to the setting this prone Pawn\
      \ should have on the Server), perhaps at map start.  For example, my Pawn should\
      \ be set to PHYS_None (because of a special state it is in), but the default\
      \ is PHYS_Falling.  On the server this Physics special setting is known, on\
      \ the Client it is not (until the Client machine gets an update from the Server).\
      \  So, as it is now, the Player on the Client turns a corner, sees the Pawn,\
      \ the Pawn falls (PHYS_Falling), then after a moment, it updates the Pawn's\
      \ location, rotation, and Physics, and the Pawn *snaps* back to where it should\
      \ be.  My question is related to this example.  How can I force this Pawn to\
      \ update the Physics setting in time to prevent it from falling when the Client\
      \ Player sees it?  As of yet, I do not have a workable solution.  It appears\
      \ to me to be a limitation of the Replication scheme.  But, I thought I bring\
      \ the problem up here, in case anyone would like to help me find a solution.\n\
      \n'''Graphik:''' Your expanded description still leaves me guessing, but I recommend\
      \ you use the ModifyPlayer function. [[Legacy:Mutator|Mutator]] features a description\
      \ of the function as well as an example of its use.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' My suspicion\
      \ is that this is not something that Graphik can help me with. ''(No offense,\
      \ Graphik)''  But I will try to elaborate one point that appears to have been\
      \ missed.  Replication, as Unreal uses it by default, causes the above example\
      \ situation automatically, where the Pawn as it exists on the Client gets an\
      \ update to important non-default settings on properties such as Physics only\
      \ after the Client Player has seen it.  Unreal Replication is able to handle\
      \ elaborate maps because it does not replicate everything all the time, only\
      \ the bare minimum that's needed, when it's needed, to ''simulate'' what's happening\
      \ on the Server.  This example I've described above shows that scheme in action,\
      \ but I am looking for a clever workaround to somehow force this Client Pawn\
      \ to update either instantly (when the Client Player sees it) perhaps do something\
      \ that will ensure the Client Pawn is already set to the proper (not the default)\
      \ Physics setting before this line of sight occurs.  The goal would be to avoid\
      \ the situation where the Client Players see this Pawn fall and then snap back\
      \ to the proper location a moment later (depending on current netspeed conditions).\
      \  IOW, I have not coded some nifty line of sight stuff, this is just how Unreal\
      \ Replication works now.  I'm looking for some kind of override, so the Client\
      \ Pawn does not rely on it's default property setting.  I would consider whatever\
      \ workaround works, and use it on other properties as well, such as Animation-related\
      \ properties, etc.\n\n'''EricBlade:''' bAlwaysRelevant ?\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ I thought about that.  It seemed like overkill for a prone Pawn, but at the\
      \ moment that appears to be the only working idea I've run across.  I'm also\
      \ not sure how well that property works, being switched on/off, which I would\
      \ want to do if this Pawn is in it's special state, and when it leaves it and\
      \ should act more like a normal Pawn on Clients.  Thanks for the idea. :)  Hopefully\
      \ a more economical idea can be found as well.\n\n'''EricBlade:''' Seems like\
      \ months since I last looked at this page, but it should probably work pretty\
      \ well - if you set it bAlwaysRelevant, and it's not doing anything, it shouldn't\
      \ cause any major changes in net traffic, as it'll do it's replication stuff\
      \ when the player connects, but then otherwise it isn't doing anything.  As\
      \ far as I can tell, setting bAlwaysRelevant on and off works pretty well -\
      \ I've seen several Land of the Dead maps that have used a Security Camera type\
      \ thing, but had to install a volume that makes whatever enters it bAlwaysRelevant,\
      \ so that you could monitor things in a remote room (pawns would not be relevant\
      \ halfway across the map, so you couldn't see them on remote cameras)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ I'm guessing you've solved this problem by now.  But, wouldn't it be possible\
      \ to use the bAlwaysRelevant flag with an inventory object?  It seems like a\
      \ really ugly hack work around to me ... just an off the wall idea.  It's probably\
      \ crazy though. \n\n===Control point status dissapearing from hud.===\n\n'''plugwash''':\
      \ a friend of mine has made a domination map based on the hall of champions\
      \ (original UT) it works fine singleplayer but in netplay the control point\
      \ status usually dissapears from the hud on first death (i think at least one\
      \ control point captured by someone is also a prerequisite to the dissapearance).\
      \ Ive tried removing all actors that seem to be designed for that map and even\
      \ exporting and re-importing into a new map but still the issue persists any\
      \ ideas on what this could be or how to track it down?\n\n===REPLICATING A VARIABLE===\n\
      \nI having a problem with replication. For the past 2 weeks all I have been\
      \ doing is researching it and nothing can barely explain it. I understand some\
      \ of it, or at least I think I do. No replication I make works, at all, in any\
      \ cases. It is just getting to me too much, how it simply does not work.\n\n\
      Anyways I wrote this script. Remember, some coding in this may seem \"noobish\"\
      \ but this is just practice for me you could say. What it does is when this\
      \ item is added to your inventory, it takes the value of an array in another\
      \ actor. The variable is called LastPlayed. This value is not replicated to\
      \ the client. So what I'm trying to do here is (since I cant replicate a variable\
      \ that exists in another actor I didnt make) is assign the value of LastPlayed\
      \ to ClientIP and then replicate ClientIP over to the client where they process\
      \ it.\n\nHere is the class...\n\n<uscript>//==============================================================================\n\

      \ are using to replicate things (Weapon, Info, Actor, Emitter etc.) has to exist\
      \ on both server and client. You chose Inventory, which exists on both sides\
      \ IF it was spawned on the server. Also, giving it to the player and adding\
      \ it to the chain ensures the simulation of the class' functions (as well as\
      \ setting it to SimulatedProxy which, iirc Inventories have them). I used ArrayCount\
      \ to show you a nice way to get the number of elements in case you didn't know\

      \ I'm starting a mutator that a Pawn recieves the weapon they are shot with.\
      \  Should I reference the gun they are shot with through Instigator.Weapon '''or'''\
      \ Projectile properties? \n\n'''Xian:''' So if I got it straight... you shoot\
      \ me with a SnowGun (yes I am original :P) and I'll receive it either when being\
      \ shot, either after respawning, right ? (well for short you want to know how\
      \ to \"save\" it, as you said, reference, the Attacker's weapon, correct ?).\n\
      \nIt's even simpler than that. You use TakeDamage() and then do InstigatedBy.Weapon\
      \ (or whatever parameter name it has since it can vary). Hmm from a quick glance\
      \ at the source now, I see you can use the GameRules class to hook in the game\
      \ ReduceDamage function (it uses the pointer GameRulesModifiers iirc). And you\
      \ can do your thing there :)\n\n===Crashing during garbage collection??===\n\
      \n'''EricBlade:''' I am getting reports of crashing on level change, from people\
      \ who are running my custom [[Legacy:Land Of The Dead|Land of the Dead]] game\
      \ type.  We are so far unable to find a condition that specifically triggers\
      \ it, but after a period of time, typically ranging from an hour to two or three\
      \ hours, and anywhere from 1 to 10 level changes, the server will crash on level\
      \ change.  It appears to me that it is happening during Garbage Collection at\
      \ the end of level, as the following from the log shows:\n Log: Collecting garbage\n\
      \ Log: Purging garbage\n Critical: UObject::GetPathName\n\n.. it crashes at\
      \ this same point on nearly all of the crashes that i've been sent logs for.\
      \  What could I be doing that would cause this?\n\n'''Xian:''' I'd have to see\
      \ the source but my quickest guess would be an object still has an actor pointer\
      \ that wasn't set to None and/or an Actor has an Object pointer which is not\
      \ set to None on Destroyed() events. Generally speaking if it's \"in use\" it\
      \ can't be deleted and it will create that problem.\n\n'''EricBlade:''' Hm.\
      \  That's what I'd thought might be the problem, except that I don't have any\

      \  A couple of people have told me that they have run the stock game for days\
      \ without crashing, but we are getting incredibly regular crashes with mine\

      \ when you crouch a lot? Also when I crouch the model stays the same height\
      \ but the eye height drops to the default for ut 2004, and also the model stays\
      \ the same size but falls halfway through the ground so the top of the head\
      \ is at the default height. If I crouch multiple times the model just falls\
      \ through the ground. Any ideas? \n\n'''SuperApe:''' Crouching code, including\
      \ eyeheight changes, is in Pawn and its subclasses.\n\n'''Stinky:''' Well, I\

      \ No need to post a screenie, we get it from your description of the problem.\

      \ a class system very similar to the RegularEngine but I can’t seem to get the\

      \ in the RegularEngine either (The sniper speed is supposed to increase to 550\
      \ but it doesn’t). Is there something else I need to do so the GroundSpeed changes\
      \ with each class? Also to add on to my description, when I use the redemer\
      \ secondary fire then come back into the player view the running speed does\
      \ take effect. \n\n'''Stinky:''' Will someone please help.     I came up with\
      \ a temp solution but it seems really wrong to do. I set a timer at the beginning\
      \ of each spawn to adjust the ground speed for a few ticks.\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
      \ You're right, that does sound wrong.  So, what you're saying is you're using\
      \ the same Pawn class, but trying to adjust GroundSpeed?  And this can't be\
      \ done with a Mutator using ModifyPlayer() or something?\n\n'''Stinky:''' Yeah,\
      \ the way im doing it now works, but it seems a little too complicated for what\
      \ i think should be a simple task. I am working on a total conversion so a mutator\

      \ around this. Basically i need this info to be written to a text file so that\
      \ an outside program can see who won etc. People gave me hints on extending\
      \ the console to do this but i have no idea where to start (total programming\
      \ novice). But then i thought that if i ran a server on the same machine and\
      \ had my game connect to it then the server must store this information somewhere\
      \ as it has to share these results with all the other clients. Its a university\
      \ project to create a non linear game and i decided to use the unreal engine.to\
      \ get around loading cutscenes and different endings i decided that i could\

      \ maps must have multiple exits i thought that if i made a game type mod that\
      \ when you reached exit 1  you ranked first in the level,exit two you ranked\
      \ second and so forth. Then this outcome would be written to a text file that\
      \ director could read and then director would interpret these results and know\
      \ which level to load. I just dont really know which way to turn. Please help!!!\n\
      \n'''Sweavo:''' You're crazy if you think you can do this with no scripting!\

      \  Look in the wiki for getting started information.  You want to build a Mutator.\
      \  Mutator contains a method that is called at game end and you can extend this\

      \n'''Nobody:''' Read up on [[Legacy:Config Vars And .Ini Files|Config Vars And\

      \ This seems blatantly obvious, but I can't find it: how does UT99 handle making\

      \ approximately the right effect by setting bGravityZone to True in the [[Legacy:LevelInfo_(UT)|LevelInfo]]\

      \ another way to do it, since that \"fix\" isn't active in DM-Morpheus, but\
      \ I haven't been able to find it. What am I missing here?\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ I suspect Morpheus does it at the ZoneInfo level, since the indoor areas have\

      \ the feel consistent...\n\n'''Ch3z:''' I don't know if this helps or not, but\
      \ the code in Botpack.LowGrav is very simple. It expands Mutator, gets rid of\
      \ all UtJumpboots and sets the ZoneGravity properties of all ZoneInfo in the\
      \ map to vect(0,0,-200) in the CheckReplacement function. That's all it does.\
      \ I was also thinking you might look into embedding a mutator into your map\

      \ so when it is triggered  the karma actor would follow the mover and at the\
      \ same time swing, be shot, and other fun stuff to do with karma actors.\n\n\
      The idea is to make an elevator that is held with chains that could swing and\
      \ ultimately break when shot.\n\nThe KBSJoint should do the trick except that\
      \ it won't work with anything that is either BSP geometry or an other karma\
      \ actor, and during gameplay, when the karma is activated, the thing shoots\
      \ of to the center of the world.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' It is possible that you are\
      \ not setting up the KBSJoint correctly. It is intended to go between either\
      \ a Karma simulated actor and another Karma simulated actor, or a Karma simulated\
      \ actor and the world.\n\nI believe that attaching to a mover will require a\
      \ modest amount of coding. However, if you are going to have to custom code\
      \ something it might not make sense to use Karma at all, and instead code your\
      \ own elevator physics, since it is a fairly simple case.\n\nAlternatively,\
      \ you could get rid of the mover and make the whole thing work on Karma. That\
      \ would also require some amount of scripting.\n\n===Calling movement(moveforward\

      \ adding hooking functions there (or simply do it easier by changing them directly\
      \ in Engine.PlayerController). The reason I told you to use an Input class is\
      \ that the input moments are best accessed in the PlayerInput ticking event,\

      \ for the player to be able to do right now is be able to click anywhere on\
      \ the ground (with the mouse of course) and then have the pawn of the player\
      \ move there.  Later I want to add other stuff, but I figure if I figure this\
      \ out first, I can do the other stuff pretty fast.  Can anyone help me to get\
      \ the mouse able to be clicked on the ground and have the pawn move there? \

      \ in a very wierd way whenever I play the map.  Its like the corridor behind\
      \ the Zone (which has nothing to do with the zone itself)  Is overriding the\
      \ corridor that the Zone links to.  The zone still works perfectly, but its\
      \ just a glaring aesthetic problem.  I am aware that that was perhaps not the\
      \ best explanation ever but its a wierd problem.  If there were some way of\
      \ posting the map here.... Dunno, if anyone has any help, i would seriously\
      \ appreciate it.  Also I have two other, complete maps which I would like to\
      \ distribute and don't know how.    \n\n'''evil_blue_dude:UTF8_REPLACEMENT9;''Rotate\
      \ one of the zone portals 180 degress. If that doesnt work then rotate them\
      \ both 180 degrees. (but be sure to try the first before trying the second)\n\
      \n'''Jezinator:''' Yes i did try that, even before I asked here, it doesn't\
      \ help.  I can't figure out why that happened.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I'm not sure\
      \ if I'm understanding the problem correctly, but it sounds like you might want\
      \ to try setting the walls of the corridor that has the warpzone info in it\
      \ to fake backdrop.\n\n'''MythOpus:''' The author probably hasn't been here\
      \ for some time now but don't the WarpZoneInfos override the texture they have\
      \ on the surface anyways?  Having that transparent texture could be throwing\
      \ the WarpZoneInfo off and having it reveal BSP on the other side.\n\n===Collision\
      \ And caft===\n\n'''FOD'''Hi im making a mod which is a subclass of decoration\
      \ the only problem is that when i assign a static mesh to the class and play\
      \ the level im finding all the wheeled craft are sinking into the meshes. I've\
      \ got collision meshes on the objects and they work fine as just static meshs,\
      \ but as soon as i use them in a script i find i can drive right through them?\
      \ Im sure they were fine at one point, but my head so full of code im realy\
      \ not sure anymore.lol.\n\n'''MythOpus:'''By Wheeled Craft do you mean to imply\
      \ you're using the karma system?  If so you will need to create Karam Collision\
      \ Hulls.  Don't know if you already do have them or not though :S\n\n'''FOD'''I\
      \ think the collision hulls are set ok (if i choose View colision in unrealed\
      \ the meshs all have pink outlines.) ive got all the settings in collision in\
      \ the actors properties set to on. Should i be using the simplified collision\
      \ hull karma/line or box. Its real odd as im using the same static meshs for\
      \ things like vehicle lifts and the collision is fine there. When i say wheeled\
      \ craft i mean the scorpion,helbender,hovertenk,artillery and the shock tank.\
      \ They dont go right through the mesh...just sink up to about their wheel axle.\
      \ Like being in quicksand? Im sure the answer is blindingly obvious but its\
      \ winding me up to be getting these sort of problems after all the coding ive\
      \ just done.For a test made script that just places an actor onto the level:-\n\
      \n<uscript> class MyActor extends Actor\n\tplaceable;\n\ndefaultproperties\n\
      {\n     DrawType=DT_StaticMesh\n     StaticMesh=StaticMesh'HumanoidHardware.Beams.jribbedcolumn01HA'\n\
      \     DrawScale3D=(X=50.000000,Y=50.000000,Z=1.000000)     \n     bCollideActors=True\n\
      \     bBlockActors=True\n     bAutoAlignToTerrain=True\n     bBlockKarma=True\n\
      \n}</uscript> \n\nNow if i try to drive over this in a wheeled craft...quicksand!\n\
      \nbut if i simply just place a static mesh into the map next to it ..the static\
      \ mesh one is solid and\n\ncan be driven over? im confused.\n\nThe collision\
      \ is fine if you side swipe the mesh or hit it with a flying craft or even if\
      \ i just drive directly at it.\n\nJust did another test..used the same script\
      \ as above but this time made it a subclass of 'mover' and the collision is\
      \ ok.?! I suppose i could derive the mod from a mover rather than a decoration\
      \ but i think there are certain network issues with the 'mover' class which\
      \ may upset the way my mod works.What are the properties that mover have that\
      \ make it more solid?\n\n===ACTION_ShootTarget... what are the firing modes?===\n\
      \n'''Tomko:''' Trying to setup the above action, but the bot just doesnt want\
      \ to fire at the SetViewTarget I've assigned. Through reading this udn page\
      \ (http://udn.epicgames.com/Two/ScriptedSequenceActions#ShootTarget), it lists\
      \ AssaultRifle Modes, but I can't get those working either. I have an ACTION_SetViewTarget\
      \ above it, which points to another xPawn for him to shoot, but it's a no go.\
      \ The other pawn is in view, in distance, etc... just can't figure out what\
      \ I might be doing wrong.\n\nAny assistance would be greatly appreciated, there\
      \ doesn't seem to be a wealth of information on this action, anywhere!\n\np.s.\
      \ I've also tried the ACTION_FireWeaponAt to no avail.\n\n===Make bots/monsters\
      \ ignore you?===\n\n'''Missilemaster:''' I'm very new to coding; right now I'm\
      \ finishing up a modified Raptor with a \"cloaking device\", which puts an invisible\
      \ skin on it. It works well, but, of course, bots and monsters can \"see\" it\
      \ when it's cloaked. Besides map botpathing, I know basically nothing about\
      \ bot AI. Does anyone know a relatively simple way to make computer opponents\
      \ ignore this vehicle when it's cloaked (that is, when a variable is a certain\
      \ value)?\n\n'''Defx:''' I suggest taking a look at Invis Combo, there seems\
      \ to be a function called SetInvisibility, hope this helps\n\n===Console Commands\
      \ / exec function doesn't work===\n\n'''Jan:''' Which classes (UT99) can I use\
      \ for adding new console commands? I used PlayerPawn but nothing happens if\
      \ I typed in the command into the console. UT returns with \"unrecognized command\"\
      \ message. I've tested it with a simple class like that:\n\n<uscript>class something\
      \ expands PlayerPawn\n\nexec function LogStuff()\n{\n  log(\"log tah f******\
      \ stuff\");\n}</uscript>\n\n'''Xian:''' UScript: Engine.PlayerPawn, Engine.Console,\
      \ Engine.Inventory, Engine.HUD (and subclasses obviously)\n\nNative: (apart\
      \ from the above) Engine.Player, Engine.SubSystem, Engine.Client, Engine.Engine,\
      \ Engine.GameInfo, Engine.Input, Engine.Level (NOT ENGINE.LEVELINFO), and of\
      \ course, all their subclasses...\n\nIt isn't as simple as subclassing PlayerPawn\
      \ and that's it... you need to subclass a proper player controller subclass\
      \ (namely something like TMale1 or TMale2 which are children of TournamentPlayer\
      \ which is a child class of PlayerPawn) and then insert them in the game with\
      \ a mutator by hooking Engine.Mutator.ModifyLogin()\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Well\
      \ I'm pretty sure PlayerPawn DOES work with exec functions but as you said,\
      \ you DO have to get it into the game somehow.  If you created a class and put\
      \ an exec function in it and thats it, its like... er... trying to use a coffee\
      \ maker thats still in the car.  You have to take it out of the car, i.e. have\
      \ the player take 'control' of the PlayerPawn, take the coffeemaker out of the\
      \ box and use it, i.e. Call the exec function on that PlayerPawn.  If the player\
      \ doesn't have control of the PlayerPawn when you call the exec function, then\
      \ engine gives you the \"unrecognized command\" because it really doesn't know\
      \ that command even exists. \n\n----\n\n===Recent Changes & Image Upload/Deletion===\n\
      \n'''Kartoshka:''' I noticed that the Recent Changes page doesn't show my username\
      \ when uploading or deleting an image, only my IP address. My username ''does''\
      \ show up after a normal page edit though. Not a big deal, but maybe something\
      \ to look at...:)\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' It does show ''mine'' when I do anything\
      \ &ndash; support for that is built in.  I've noticed that I seem to be the\
      \ only Unreal Wiki user whose user name is displayed when doing anything in\
      \ the image uploader, though &ndash; I wonder why that is.  Which URL do you\
      \ use to access the Unreal Wiki?  (Perhaps it's a cookie-related issue.)\n\n\
      '''Kartoshka:''' I use wiki.beyondunreal.com. I tried www.unrealwiki.com, but\
      \ this just redirected me to wiki.beyondunreal.com. I tried logging in after\
      \ entering www.unrealwiki.com just to be sure, and the same thing happened.\
      \ (no username, just IP on upload and deletion). I am even using a different\
      \ computer with a different IP address than before, so it doesn't seem likely\
      \ to be a problem on my end.\n\n----\n\n===Static Array Limit?===\n\n'''MM:'''\
      \ Is there a limit to the [length] of a static array? (In Unreal Engine 1) Such\
      \ as <uscript>var string testtxt[1000000]\n</uscript>\n\n'''MythOpus:'''  Yes\
      \ I do believe there is a limit and its probably lower then UE 2.x.  I can't\
      \ give you exact specifics but you can try different values for the length of\
      \ an array and see if the compiler complains.  I'm not sure if it will but if\
      \ it doesn't you should also try writing/reading to the last index of the array\
      \ just to be sure.\n\n'''Ambershee:''' If it's something that's going to be\
      \ replicated, then the limit is horribly low. It's 9. I found that out the hard\
      \ and horrible way.\n\n===Projectile Options changing replication===\n\n'''Neo_b:'''\
      \ Hello, I wrote an item that changes nearby projectiles heading player's way\
      \ acceleration in an opposite direction. Works fine in singleplayer, although\
      \ It doesnt' work in multiplayer, presumably because of missing replication.\
      \ I have no idea how to replicate it. Can anybody help me? I used foreach AllActors\
      \ and if a projectile heads player on at least one axe, it its acceleration\
      \ is changed to reversed velocity and rotation is also reversed by 180 degrees."
