      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>I choose this mutator because it'll be a nice change\
      \ of pace from my current mod project, and I doubt it'll take any longer than\
      \ a night or two of coding to get it working. Nothing to fancy here, and I think\
      \ there's some stuff I've used in the mod that I can pull over into this project.</p>\n\
      <p>Here's how I'm going to pull it off:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change primary fire on\
      \ link gun to instagib shot</li>\n<li>Make InstaGibLink &amp; InstaGibAVRiL\
      \ default weapons</li>\n<li>Remove all non-InstaGib weaponry</li>\n<li>Remove\
      \ all ammo</li>\n<li>Remove or Alter all Weapon Lockers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Possible\
      \ options for Ammo usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlimited</li>\n<li>Limited</li>\n\
      <li>Limited w/recharge (don't use it for X amount of time, ammo begins to recharge)</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>I think the ammo for both weapons needs to operate in the same way.\
      \ That means one less thing for players to worry about and less confusing ammo\
      \ operations in general. I'm partial to the recharge right now, because it puts\
      \ a damper on the spammers who'll just hold down fire and hope to hit someone,\
      \ but it shouldn't effect anyone using the gun in a smart manner. It also means\
      \ building bases will be a tactical decision as well, because it uses valuable\
      \ ammunition.</p>\n<p>The one problem is damage to bases. If the primary fire\
      \ does loads of damage, then destroying bases will be simple. Perhaps creating\
      \ an armor object that magnifies instagib damage while nullifying beam damage\
      \ is the way to go. Then, you'll have to use the beam to build/destroy bases,\
      \ the AVRiL for vehicles, and instagib for players. Vehicles will be the real\
      \ tricky thing to contend with. Basicly, does the instagib beam hurt them at\
      \ all? or is it AVRiL only? if I remember correctly, the bean needs a minimum\
      \ amount of damage to be registered as a \"hit\", at least for the pawns. The\
      \ idea is to create as few classes as possible.</p>\n<p>OK, classes to create:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>ONSIG_Link.uc - The primary gun</li>\n<li>ONSIG_LinkFire.uc - Instagib\
      \ beam</li>\n<li>ONSIG_AVRiL.uc - The modified AVRiL (for ammo recharge)</li>\n\
      <li>ONSIG_Armor.uc - To modify \"hits\" to the player</li>\n<li>ONSIG_Mutator.uc\
      \ - The file that makes the magic happen</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\n\
