      \ a great resource, and I'm glad I can contribute (though it's pretty miniscule).\

      \ The hierarchy is where the learning curve is. I worked at Apple for almost\
      \ 8 years and then a brief stint at Adobe. Then I worked on my own stuff for\
      \ a while, then Yahoo! and now Apple again. The circle is now complete!</p>\n\
      <p>I'm an avid Bombing Run player and play most nights, even now (when noone\
      \ plays any more). We still do 1.35 Instagib low-grav. We're crazy like that.</p>\n\
      <p>Why off-kilter? I dunno. I guess that's how I felt when I had to make a name\

      <p>Another mut called TimeToBomb was a custom gametype (only because I found\
