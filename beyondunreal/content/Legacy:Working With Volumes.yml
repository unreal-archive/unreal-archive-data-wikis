      \ Explain how I add one.</p>\n<p><b>the G.o.a.T:</b> It's quite simple actually.\
      \ Assume for example you want to add water somewhere. Make the <a href=\"/Legacy:Red_Builder_Brush\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Red Builder Brush\">red builder brush</a> take the general\
      \ shape of what need to be filled with water. I used simple cubes in my test\
      \ maps as they seem to cause no trouble in passing trough level-construct&#160;:).\
      \ Click the button \"Add Volume\" -&gt; select WaterVolume. Done&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p>You'll have to add a <a href=\"/Legacy:Sheet\" title=\"Legacy:Sheet\">sheet</a>\
      \ if you want the water to have a visible water-surface&#160;:/ A watervolume\
      \ just contains the physics of water, nothing more.</p>\n<p><b>Birelli:</b>\
      \ I noticed when I tried adding one it colored the sides of the area it was\
      \ filling slightly blue. It made it look more like it was underwater. Does anyone\
      \ know if this is an actual effect in the game or is it just a way for the Ed\
      \ to show you you're in a volume?</p>\n<p><b>the G.o.a.T:</b> A watervolume\
      \ might show up blueish due to the fact of the blue fogging they use in the\
      \ water.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Is the old zoning method still possible? This\
      \ is going to be such a pain with things like curved pipes. It's <a href=\"\
      /edit/Legacy:Quake?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Quake (page does\
      \ not exist)\">Quake</a>1-style.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> I have a source\
      \ that claims that it is ... I've put the question to eepers on the Polycount\
      \ message board so we'll see what he comes back with. He is a modelling/prefab\
      \ guru by default btw. And indeed Tarquin - it is very reminiscient of Quake\
      \ 1 mapping (oh the pain).</p>\n<p><b>the G.o.a.T:</b> Not without scripting.\
      \ I found no <a href=\"/Legacy:WaterZone\" title=\"Legacy:WaterZone\">WaterZone</a>Info\
      \ in there. The only zone-actors in there are <a href=\"/Legacy:LevelInfo\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:LevelInfo\">LevelInfo</a>, <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:SkyInfo?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:SkyInfo (page does not exist)\">SkyInfo</a> and\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:WarpZoneInfo\" title=\"Legacy:WarpZoneInfo\">WarpZoneInfo</a>.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> If you manage to have a hollow curved pipe, you obviously\
      \ have the inside of that pipe as a shape already (de-/intersect). Using that\
      \ as a base for a volume shouldn't be a problem. Never forget that we're still\
      \ working with CSG here, not purely additive geometry like Quake does...</p>\n\
      <p><b>Highlander:</b> And if this tube is a static mesh would it act like BSP\
      \ that it uh.. \"blocks\" zones&#160;? (hmmm theres a thought do static meshes\
      \ act as zone boundarys? ) so making a water pipe would be hard in that respect.\
      \ You would need to model the static mesh, then create the water inside the\
      \ static mesh as a volume.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Yes, I see – if architecture\
      \ is made with static meshes, then that can't be divided up into zones – because\
      \ they are a <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP\" title=\"Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a> construction.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Highlander: Static meshes don't work as zone portals; as\
      \ tarquin says, only BSP does. (And since zones are much more heavily relied\
      \ on for level optimization than ever before, \"wasting\" them for water effects\
      \ and the like doesn't seem appropriate.)</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Mychaeel\
      \ - that may not be the case if your hollow pipe is actually constructed from\
      \ a static mesh. You may then additionally have to add a \"pipe shaped\" BlockingVolume\
      \ taking up the space of your pipe, and still have to \"model\" the pipe interior\
      \ for your WaterVolume.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> That's right, but firstly you\
      \ couldn't have used your static mesh pipe for zoning anyway and secondly you\
      \ <i>can</i> convert static meshes to BSP, at least temporarily, deintersect\
      \ to get your WaterVolume's shape and remove the temporary BSP afterwards again.</p>\n\
      <p><b>SaxxonPike</b> Physics volumes are for defining gravity and other physics.\
      \ I'm not quite sure about the DefaultPhysicsVolume thing yet.</p>\n<p><b>Highlander:</b>\
      \ The Default Physics volume is the volume that controls the gravity etc when\
      \ your not in a regular physics volume... it is the default settings.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Ragdoll:</b> Ive found some very interesting uses for physics volumes.\
      \ Say you have an open manhole cover and you want players that fall into it\
      \ to die, simply add a physics volume (about 500 units in height is usually\
      \ suffice) and set its \"damagepersec\" option (under physics volume) to 1000\
      \ or something. Also very useful if you have a tank of acid that should slowly\
      \ degrade the health of players who fall in, you can make a physics volume the\
      \ same size as the water volume and set the damge per sec to 20 or something,\
      \ depending on how quickly you want them to die.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> A <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:WaterVolume\" title=\"Legacy:WaterVolume\">WaterVolume</a>\
      \ already is a subclass of <a href=\"/Legacy:PhysicsVolume\" title=\"Legacy:PhysicsVolume\"\
      >PhysicsVolume</a>, so why add two things of the same kind if one can do the\
      \ trick as well? You can even use that WaterVolume to give the tank's inside\
      \ area a location name and trigger an event when a player enters it.</p>\n<p><b>Ragdoll:</b>\
      \ Ok thanks for that, im sure it will come in very handy (open holes in the\
      \ ground are always a laugh in multiplayer, so are tanks of acid)</p>\n<hr />\n\
      <p><b>KungFu Hampster:</b> Can someone who knows how to track playerposition\
      \ using volumes please post some info on this? I've found a lack of info out\
      \ there about this and I've had a heck of a time figureing it out. I'm sure\
      \ there are other people who are having the same problem.</p>\n<p><b>Solid Snake:</b>\
      \ Boo hoo, so what if there is NO info on this. All you do is add a pawn to\
      \ an array, and then do log the changes to its location. Surely it can't be\
      \ *that* hard.</p>\n<p><b>KungFu Hampster:</b> It becomes more difficult when\
      \ you want to track the location and have something appear that diplays the\
      \ player location on the HUD</p>\n<p><b>KungFu Hampster:</b> I've just written\

      \ shape already (de-/intersect).  Using that as a base for a volume shouldn't\
      \ be a problem.  Never forget that we're still working with CSG here, not purely\
      \ additive geometry like Quake does...\n\n'''Highlander:''' And if this tube\
      \ is a static mesh would it act like BSP that it uh.. \"blocks\" zones ? (hmmm\
      \ theres a thought do static meshes act as zone boundarys? ) so making a water\
      \ pipe would be hard in that respect. You would need to model the static mesh,\
      \ then create the water inside the static mesh as a volume.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Yes, I see &ndash; if architecture is made with static meshes, then that can't\
      \ be divided up into zones &ndash; because they are a [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]] construction.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Highlander:  Static meshes don't work as zone portals; as\
      \ tarquin says, only BSP does.  (And since zones are much more heavily relied\
      \ on for level optimization than ever before, \"wasting\" them for water effects\
      \ and the like doesn't seem appropriate.)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''  Mychaeel -\
      \ that may not be the case if your hollow pipe is actually constructed from\
      \ a static mesh.  You may then additionally have to add a \"pipe shaped\" BlockingVolume\
      \ taking up the space of your pipe, and still have to \"model\" the pipe interior\
      \ for your WaterVolume.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' That's right, but firstly you couldn't\
      \ have used your static mesh pipe for zoning anyway and secondly you ''can''\
      \ convert static meshes to BSP, at least temporarily, deintersect to get your\
      \ WaterVolume's shape and remove the temporary BSP afterwards again.\n\n'''SaxxonPike'''\
      \ Physics volumes are for defining gravity and other physics.  I'm not quite\
      \ sure about the DefaultPhysicsVolume thing yet.\n\n'''Highlander:''' The Default\
      \ Physics volume is the volume that controls the gravity etc when your not in\
      \ a regular physics volume... it is the default settings.\n\n'''Ragdoll:'''\
      \ Ive found some very interesting uses for physics volumes. Say you have an\
      \ open manhole cover and you want players that fall into it to die, simply add\
      \ a physics volume (about 500 units in height is usually suffice) and set its\
      \ \"damagepersec\" option (under physics volume) to 1000 or something. Also\
      \ very useful if you have a tank of acid that should slowly degrade the health\
      \ of players who fall in, you can make a physics volume the same size as the\
      \ water volume and set the damge per sec to 20 or something, depending on how\
      \ quickly you want them to die.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' A [[Legacy:WaterVolume|WaterVolume]]\
      \ already is a subclass of [[Legacy:PhysicsVolume|PhysicsVolume]], so why add\
      \ two things of the same kind if one can do the trick as well? You can even\
      \ use that WaterVolume to give the tank's inside area a location name and trigger\
      \ an event when a player enters it.\n\n'''Ragdoll:''' Ok thanks for that, im\
      \ sure it will come in very handy (open holes in the ground are always a laugh\
      \ in multiplayer, so are tanks of acid)\n\n----\n\n'''KungFu Hampster:''' Can\
      \ someone who knows how to track playerposition using volumes please post some\
      \ info on this?  I've found a lack of info out there about this and I've had\
      \ a heck of a time figureing it out.  I'm sure there are other people who are\
      \ having the same problem.\n\n'''Solid Snake:''' Boo hoo, so what if there is\
      \ NO info on this. All you do is add a pawn to an array, and then do log the\
      \ changes to its location. Surely it can't be *that* hard.\n\n'''KungFu Hampster:'''\
      \ It becomes more difficult when you want to track the location and have something\
      \ appear that diplays the player location on the HUD\n\n'''KungFu Hampster:'''\
      \ I've just written a bsic tutorial on using a [[Legacy:CaptureVolume|CaptureVolume]].\
