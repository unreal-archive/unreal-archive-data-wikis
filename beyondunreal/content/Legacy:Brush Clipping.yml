      \ clipping tool is handy for trimming multiple brushes at once, or sometimes\
      \ slicing up a brush that can't stick out at all. Basically all you do is select\
      \ the clipping tool, hold Ctrl, and click on two vertices to place the two 'pins'.\
      \ Then grab the pins and move them wherever you want to create your cutting\
      \ plane. The side with the little tick (T) on it is the side that gets cut off.\
      \ You can use the flip button to reverse the tick (uber handy - just get the\
      \ pins where you want and flip the thingy until its right). The cut button is\
      \ what you press to actually lop off part of the brush.</p>\n<p>The split button\
      \ will cut one brush into two separate brushes, this will not work on the builder\
      \ brush itself, but will work on any other brush already placed in the level.\
      \ The delete button just gets rid of the pins.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ clipping, it is important which viewport you use. Clipping is always done\
      \ by a plane - think of it as a large blade. If you use the top view, the blade\
      \ will cut straight down on the line connecting the two pins. If you use the\
      \ side view, the blade cuts sideways. You can do diagonal cuts in 2D, but they\
      \ will only slope one way - as you look at them in 2D. In 3D, three points are\
      \ enough to define any plane, and so if you have three pins, UnrealEd performs\
      \ a 3D clip no matter what view port you are in.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
