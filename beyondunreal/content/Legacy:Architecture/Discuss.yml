      \ complex and unfriendly to browse. Maybe we should put the more basic stuff\
      \ at the beginning (brush,addition/substracion,etc...). It looks a bit like\

      <dl>\n<dd><i>Tarquin</i> It's a fair point. I've been pondering that page for\
      \ a few days. I like the \"Creating Shapes\" section, because that groups all\
      \ the ways of changing the red builder brush, though the actual header name\
      \ I just made up on the spot&#160;;-)<br />\nI'm not sure what everyone had\
      \ against <a href=\"/Legacy:Beginner_Topics\" title=\"Legacy:Beginner Topics\"\
      >Beginner Topics</a>, maybe that could become the \"introduction to mapping\"\

      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Subtraction_And_Addition\" title=\"Legacy:Subtraction And\

      \ The 'beginners topic' section is copycat of 'tutorial', a complete noob would\

      /Legacy:Beginner_Topics\" title=\"Legacy:Beginner Topics\">Beginner Topics</a>\
      \ was that it would be a selection of links from places like Architecture, arranged\
      \ in n00b-friendly order with extra explanations &amp; also links to n00b-specific\
      \ tutorials. Alternatively, we could have a sub-page like Architecture/Beginners.<br\
