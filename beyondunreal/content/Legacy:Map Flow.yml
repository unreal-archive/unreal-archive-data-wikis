    text: "<p><b>Map flow</b> is a somewhat subjective term. It could be defined as\
      \ the sum value of the potential movements, actions and strategies a map has.\
      \ Making it even harder to define, map flow also shares several elements from\
      \ other map design principles. Generally, the principles have to do with layout\
      \ and object placement, but they are also tied to psychology and timing. The\
      \ unifying goal for all principles that make up map flow is to maximize the\
      \ replay value of the given map.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"\

      \ the hunted. Provide extra ways either in or out of the area or make the dead\
      \ end quick to reach and retreat from. Above all remember to balance the risk\
      \ with reward by placing a strong powerup or weapon inside a dead end. Hazards\

      \ a perceptual change that registers as action to the player. Random timing\

      \ An irregular water drip will give a listening player a greater sense of purpose,\

      \ I think it sums things up very neatly.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Dear, 129.19.1.147.\

      \ If you can't sum up your point in one sentence, this is likely a less concrete\

      \ possible revision.</p>\n<p><b>129.19.1.147:</b> Arena layout</p>\n<p>The layout\
      \ of the arena plays a large part in the action. Maps can be quiet, good for\
      \ snipers, good for flak cannons, or just plain bloody. A good example of an\
      \ extremely active map is Blood Core Arena (CTF-Bloodcore, UT). You can't go\
      \ ten feet without running into an enemy. It is an intense, bloody map. My personal\
      \ congratulations to Jan Kohnert.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are maps\
      \ like Hall of Giants (CTF-HallOfGiants) and Facing Worlds. They are large,\
      \ open, and quiet. (You can't even snipe all the way across Hall of Giants.)\
      \ Then there are bad maps, like DM-BattleArena. I hope this was taken out of\
      \ UT2kx, because in UT, it was terrible. All the action is on the ground floor\
      \ because there is nothing interesting on the upper levels. I guess this is\
      \ what you would call a 'killbox'.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time\

  wikitext:
    text: "'''Map flow''' is a somewhat subjective term.  It could be defined as the\
      \ sum value of the potential movements, actions and strategies a map has.  Making\
      \ it even harder to define, map flow also shares several elements from other\
      \ map design principles.  Generally, the principles have to do with layout and\
      \ object placement, but they are also tied to psychology and timing.  The unifying\
      \ goal for all principles that make up map flow is to maximize the replay value\
      \ of the given map.\n\n==General Navigation ==\n\nThe manifestation of Map Flow\
      \ is usually thought of as an imaginary river or wind flowing through the map.\
      \  Where the flow is congested, turbulent, or imbalanced is where the map will\
      \ frustrate players the most in terms of navigation.\n\n===An Open Map and a\
      \ Variety of Routes===\n\nIf a player can see it, they should be able to reach\
      \ it very easily and without backtracking.  Players should be able to get anywhere\
      \ in a map very quickly.  The space should also include more than one way to\
      \ get to and from main landmarks.  These ideas promote both an immediate engagement\
      \ with the map's strategies and a long-term exploration of alternate tactics.\n\
      \n===Free Movements ===\n\n{{innerbox| Nothing is worse than running with the\
      \ flag and then getting stuck on a little decorative rock that looks so nice\
      \ and pretty sitting there, but is a death trap for anyone that tries to run\
      \ over it.  &rarr;''Hanover_Fist''\n\n}}\n\n\"Sticky\" spots prevent obvious\
      \ navigation when the game engine's collision detection gets in the way.  This\
      \ happens more often with static meshes, but can also happen with steeper sections\
      \ of terrain and in tight spaces made of BSP.  Make sure doorways, pathways,\
      \ tunnels and crawlspaces are big enough to move through in a firefight. See\
      \ also [[Legacy:General Scale And Dimensions|General Scale and Dimensions]].\
      \  Playtest these areas with the idea that players will be more concerned about\
      \ combat than traveling in smooth, central paths.  Playtest the edges of your\
      \ pathways, extra rough spots of terrain, and the areas with heavy decoration,\
      \ then place low-poly blocking volumes to replace any sticky static mesh collision\
      \ and discreetly cover (or just smooth) any terrain collision you find not working\
      \ well.\n\n===Dead Ends, Hazards, and Risk vs Reward ===\n\nRisk vs Reward is\
      \ the concept that there is a balance between the risks a player must take and\
      \ the rewards the player will recieve if those risks are succesfull.  A hidden\
      \ deathtrap in a main corridor or a safe pile of powerups in front of a PlayerStart\
      \ are examples of situations that are out of balance.\n\nA dead end can either\
      \ enhance or ruin a map depending on the situation.  Dead ends can provide a\
      \ focus point for combat if they are used to hold control points and flag bases\
      \ in CTF and DOM [[Legacy:Gametype|gametype]]s.  The worst thing you can do\
      \ as a mapper is force the hunted into an area of no escape; waiting for death,\
      \ while the hunter launches projectiles into the dead end.  This requires no\
      \ skill for the hunter and it aggrevates the hunted.  Provide extra ways either\
      \ in or out of the area or make the dead end quick to reach and retreat from.\
      \  Above all remember to balance the risk with reward by placing a strong powerup\
      \ or weapon inside a dead end.  Hazards suchs as open lava pools, dangerous\
      \ heavy machinery or large drop-offs should be given the same Risk vs Reward\
      \ considerations.\n\n===Interconnectivity===\n\nInterconnectivity has to do\
      \ with the varied connections between the areas of a map.  Having more than\
      \ two ways in or out of a space ensures multiple tactics in Navigation.  Players\
      \ will be aware of these extra routes as escape routes, ambush points, sniper\
      \ positions, and usable cover.  This principle can also eliminate \"perfect\"\
      \ sniper positions by forcing the sniper to look over their shoulder.  In the\
      \ extreme, this principle can be overdone, making the map lose some of the variation\
      \ or definition between areas, as if it were only one space.\n\n===Side Passages,\
      \ Escape Routes, and Cover===\n\nWhile players move from one area to another,\
      \ there will inevitably be combat.  In situations under fire, players seek cover\
      \ to block the line of fire of their opponent, while lining up their own clear\
      \ shot.  Long stretches of space without usable cover, side passages or corners\
      \ will frustrate players in the heat of combat.  Useable cover includes features\
      \ a player can use to block enemy fire, and usually block their line of sight\
      \ as well.\n\n===Rewarding Special Moves===\n\nSpecial moves such as the Translocate,\
      \ Dodge, DoubleJump, ImpactJump and LiftJump use a higher than novice skill.\
      \  Couple these skills with a knowledge of a map that rewards special moves,\
      \ and players are given the opportunity to PWN (dominate) unsuspecting opponents.\
      \  Rewards for such moves can be everything from access to a shortcut, to getting\
      \ them through a narrow escape route.  The various Jump moves can reward players\
      \ by getting them to an out-of-reach ledge with a special item on it.\n\n==The\
      \ Z-Axis==\n\nThese are the elements of the layout that take advantage of vertical\
      \ site lines, vertical movement and vertical combat.  [[Legacy:Z-Axis|Z-axis]]\
      \ has a page all to itself.\n\n==Predictability==\n\nPlayers in any game require\
      \ some certainty in order to plan ahead.  In Map Flow, certainty comes from\
      \ predictable events and structure.\n\n===Framerates and Optimization===\n\n\
      Before you start building a map, decide the maximum players it should hold in\
      \ the heat of battle.  This is the single most important factor in framerate\
      \ perfomance, given large overhead for player models, weapons fire, personal\
      \ effects and gore.  If the map holds too many players fighting in one area,\
      \ your map's performance will suffer and so will the players; especially online.\
      \  Optimize thoroughly to ensure the player's experience is smooth throughout\
      \ and your carefully timed elements are not interfered with.\n\n===Balance of\
      \ Power, No Perfect Sniper Positions===\n\nHere a map with good flow is essentially\
      \ balanced for combat between players.  In such a map, no player will accidentally\
      \ gain a severe tactical advantage or disadvantage.  No sniper position will\
      \ be \"perfect\"; that is, easily defendable, difficult to assault.  No spot\
      \ on the map should be an easy target without sufficient reward value.  Of course,\
      \ no team game maps should have inherit advantages for one team over another.\
      \  Within this balance, provide some variety of PlayerStart positions, including\
      \ a safe spots or item stashes as well as hazardous or frontline areas.  See\
      \ also [[Legacy:Placing PlayerStart|Placing PlayerStart]]\n\n===Sound cues,\
      \ Triggered Events, and Item Placement===\n\nUse triggered sounds like water\
      \ puddles that splash or carefully place items like health vials to create sound\
      \ cues near special areas.  Any detectable event that is triggered by player\
      \ movement through a space will work.  Doors often serve this purpose well,\
      \ as they usually make distinct sounds and they delineate two different areas.\
      \  These are great ways to add potential risk to high-traffic or particularly\
      \ attractive areas.  See also [[Legacy:Triggering Sounds|Triggering Sounds]]\
      \ and [[Legacy:Inventory Item Placement|Inventory Item Placement]].\n\n===Patterns\
      \ of Rhythm and Form===\n\nPlayers recognize patterns easily and use them to\
      \ their advantage.  A regular series of spaces or a regular measure of time\
      \ can allow players to predict each other's movements or changes in the environment.\
      \  A regular loud sound can cover the sounds of a player's actions.  After going\
      \ through a series of rooms with the same shape, a team can hone their tactics\
      \ as they advance.  A symetrical map can help players learn a large map in half\
      \ the time.  \n\n===Clear Goals===\n\nIt shouldn't be a complete mystery how\
      \ to succeed in a map.  If there are strategically critical positions to hold,\
      \ they should be almost immediately obvious to the player entering the map for\
      \ the first time.  A player will want to devise successfull attacking or defending\
      \ plans while getting the first impressions of a map's layout.\n\n===Building\
      \ Goals Towards a SuperGoal===\n\nA heightened sense of achievement comes from\
      \ an accumulation of efforts.  If a map's design uses a progression of actions\
      \ or challenges to achieve a climax with sufficient reward value, the players\
      \ will feel more involved and satisfied with their efforts.  The rewards can\
      \ either help the player or hurt their opponent.  The Assault (AS) and Onslaught\
      \ (ONS) gameTypes have this progession of goals clearly built into the rules\
      \ of the game, but other [[Legacy:Gametype|gametype]]s can impress players by\
      \ using the same idea in unique ways.\n\n==Action==\n\nAction is change over\
      \ time and is a term used to describe conditions changing at an irregular pace\
      \ or direction.  Whether the players change or the environment changes, action\
      \ is what players need to experience in order to feel satisfied with the game.\
      \  In many ways, the principle of Action conflicts with the principle of Predictability,\
      \ and a balance must be struck.  Although action typically implies movement,\
      \ any apparent change qualifies as action.\n\n===Variation in Space and Timing===\n\
      \nVariation is a designers best friend.  Here it's the player's perpception\
      \ of the environment that changes.  As a player is aware of the map, their perpection\
      \ of the space they're in changes when they move from space to space.  The change\
      \ from a narrow hallway to a wide room gives a perceptual change that registers\
      \ as action to the player.  Random timing can increase tension or danger and\
      \ serve to make experiences more organic.  An irregular water drip will give\
      \ a listening player a greater sense of purpose, to find a pattern, and a greater\
      \ sense of satisfaction when they come to the conclusions the pattern is complex\
      \ or there is no pattern.\n\n===Keep Up the Pace===\n\nKeeping the pace alive\
      \ is an old secret to success in performance.  Your audience, the players, don't\
      \ want to wait for the next thing to happen, the next thing should be waiting\
      \ for them.  Make sure lifts don't take too long to ride, spaces aren't too\
      \ long without some change, and progressions of predicatble events don't take\
      \ too long to complete.\n\n===Use of Layout to Create Suspense===\n\nOne of\
      \ the most subtle forms of action is a change in mood.  The player can be in\
      \ the most familiar surroundings and yet their experience can change drastically\
      \ by their level of anger, joy or fear.  By making sure a sniper position includes\
      \ an alternate entrance that just happens to be behind the sniper, you've created\
      \ tension.  By giving the opponent several routes to attack the base, you've\
      \ created potential fear for defending players.  By having regular intervals\
      \ or events end in a strange or unpredictable way, you've created suspense for\
      \ the player paying attention.\n\n===Suprises and Discovery===\n\nNo player\
      \ wants to experience \"the same old thing\".  If suprises can happen and the\
      \ player can discover new features of the map, the impulse will be there to\
      \ replay the map.  While a suprise shouldn't happen so often as to become ordinary,\
      \ it will have to be noticed to be effective.  In performance, the promise of\
      \ suprise and discovery is called, \"the hook\".  The hook can be anything from\
      \ a cryptic map description, to in-game clues, to blatant advertisement of a\
      \ secret in the map.\n\n==Related Topics ==\n* [[Legacy:Gameplay|Gameplay]]\n\

      \ the arena plays a large part in the action. Maps can be quiet, good for snipers,\
      \ good for flak cannons, or just plain bloody. A good example of an extremely\
      \ active map is Blood Core Arena (CTF-Bloodcore, UT). You can't go ten feet\
      \ without running into an enemy. It is an intense, bloody map. My personal congratulations\
      \ to Jan Kohnert.\n\nOn the other hand, there are maps like Hall of Giants (CTF-HallOfGiants)\
      \ and Facing Worlds. They are large, open, and quiet. (You can't even snipe\
      \ all the way across Hall of Giants.) Then there are bad maps, like DM-BattleArena.\
      \ I hope this was taken out of UT2kx, because in UT, it was terrible. All the\
      \ action is on the ground floor because there is nothing interesting on the\
      \ upper levels. I guess this is what you would call a 'killbox'.\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
