      <p>Now you are ready to proceed. First of all let's start with modding the game\
      \ in a way that the game's developers have actually provided for in a direct\
      \ fashion. <b>They included in the game a module named <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator_(UT)\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mutator (UT)\">Mutator (UT)</a> and it is intended for this\
      \ purpose.</b> This is by no means anywhere near the limit to what you can do.\
      \ If it was, the wiki would have been complete in a day. This module contains\
      \ functions that override functions in other parts of the game. For example\
      \ look at this function from that module:</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi\
      \ mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"\
      de1\"><span class=\"kw1\">function</span> <span class=\"kw5\">bool</span> CheckReplacement<span\
      \ class=\"br0\">(</span><span class=\"kw9\">Actor</span> Other, <span class=\"\
      kw1\">out</span> <span class=\"kw5\">byte</span> bSuperRelevant<span class=\"\
      br0\">)</span>\n<span class=\"br0\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"kw2\">return</span>\
      \ <span class=\"kw6\">true</span>;\n<span class=\"br0\">}</span></pre></div>\n\
      </div>\n<p>This function is in the Mutator module to allow you to mutate an\
      \ actor as the game checks through the actors in the map to see if they are\
      \ to to be replaced. Here you can replace one actor with another. You can replace\
      \ all weapons with one particular weapon if you like (but if this what you want\
      \ to do then study up on the Arena mutator as most of the work is done for you\
      \ already there). This function will be called and all the code in it will be\
      \ executed. You can do pretty much anything you want to here as it is an opportunity\
      \ for your code to be executed.</p>\n<p>One mutator included with the game is\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:LowGrav\" title=\"Legacy:LowGrav\">LowGrav</a>. This mutator\
      \ uses the CheckReplacement() function as an opportunity to modify all instances\
      \ of <a href=\"/Legacy:ZoneInfo\" title=\"Legacy:ZoneInfo\">ZoneInfo</a> in\
      \ any map that loads. It also uses this function to get rid of all <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:UT_JumpBoots\" title=\"Legacy:UT JumpBoots\">UT JumpBoots</a> in the\
      \ map. That's all the mutator does. It's one function long. But that function\
      \ is in a subclass of Mutator named LowGrav. It inherits all the rest of the\
      \ code from Mutator so the rest of the work is already done. See <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Object_Oriented_Programming_Overview\" title=\"Legacy:Object Oriented\
      \ Programming Overview\">Object Oriented Programming Overview</a> for more on\
      \ this, and <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator_Topics\" title=\"Legacy:Mutator Topics\"\
      >Mutator Topics</a> for more on mutators in general.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Project_Defined\">Project Defined</span><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:UT_Low_Gravity_Mutator?section=2\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Project Defined\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This is a good first mod for you, because you can\
      \ study the mutator you make here against the mutator you changed to make this\
      \ one. And you can study the [Mutator] module itself which is the class that\
      \ the LowGrav class extends.</p>\n<p>Okay, lets do it. The LowGrav mutator is\
      \ popular and surely you have played on a low grav server. This server runs\
      \ the LowGrav mutator and that's how it does it. On one of these servers you\
      \ may have encountered a place you wanted to get to, but low gravity only afforded\
      \ you to get almost high enough but not quite enough to reach that spot. <b>We\
      \ are going to make the XLowGrav mutator.</b> This will be exactly like the\
      \ LowGrav mutator but you will be able to jump quite a bit higher, and cover\
      \ more map when you jump forward from a high point then you could in LowGrav.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Make_your_working_directory\">Make your\
      \ working directory</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\

      Edit section: Make your working directory\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>First you need to <a href=\"/Legacy:Set_Up_Package_Folders\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Set Up Package Folders\">Set Up Package Folders</a> where you\
      \ will place your code for UCC to compile it from. In your UnrealTournament\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Base_Directory\" title=\"Legacy:Base Directory\">Base Directory</a>,\
      \ make a new folder named \"XLowGrav\". Open that folder and make a new folder\
      \ inside named \"Classes\". This Classes folder is where you will save your\
      \ code for UCC to find later.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Open_the_file_that_will_be_used_as_your_template\"\
      >Open the file that will be used as your template</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Open the file that will be used as your template\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Open the Botpack\
      \ folder then open the Classes folder within. You should see the modules here\
      \ named LowGrav.uc. If not you need to go back two steps and complete both the\
      \ prerequisits for this tutorial. If you do see it there, then open it up with\
      \ your <a href=\"/Legacy:Text_Editor\" title=\"Legacy:Text Editor\">text editor</a>.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Edit_the_template\">Edit the template</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:UT_Low_Gravity_Mutator?section=5\" title=\"Edit section:\

      <p>All the lines at the top that start with double slashes are comment lines\
      \ and you can put what ever message you want here as long as you don't use the\
      \ word <i>class</i>. It will be ignored by the game. So take a second and make\
      \ this mutator your own. Change the name there from <i>LowGrav</i> to <i>XLowGrav</i>\
      \ and change the description to say <i>EXTRA low gravity</i>. This next part\
      \ is important. Change the line</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code\
      \ mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"de1\"\
      > <span class=\"kw1\">class</span> LowGrav <span class=\"kw1\">expands</span>\
      \ <span class=\"kw9\">Mutator</span>;</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>to show <i>XLowGrav</i>\
      \ instead of <i>LowGrav</i>. This is the class declaration (see <a href=\"/Legacy:Class_Syntax\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Class Syntax\">class syntax</a> for more on this). It says\
      \ that this class is named XLowGrav and that it will inherit and/or override\
      \ any code in its parent class named Mutator.</p>\n<p>All you are going to do\
      \ is edit one number here. Find the line</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi\
      \ mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\">\n<pre class=\"\
      de1\"> ZoneInfo<span class=\"br0\">(</span>Other<span class=\"br0\">)</span>.<span\

      \ class=\"br0\">)</span>;</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>and change the <i>(0,0,-200)</i>\
      \ to <i>(0,0,-100)</i>. Now save this file as XLowGrav.uc (not XLowGrav.uc.txt&#160;!!)\
      \ in the Classes folder you made in your working directory for this mod.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Add_your_class_to_the_list_of_classes_to_be_compiled.\"\
      >Add your class to the list of classes to be compiled.</span><span class=\"\

      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There\
      \ it waits for you to compile it with UCC. But you can't yet. First you have\
      \ to leave a note for the compiler to know what all to compile. Open unrealtournament.ini\
      \ in your ut system folder and use the find feature of notepad to locate all\
      \ group of lines that say \"EditPackages=Core\" and such.</p>\n<p>Everytime\
      \ the Make commandlet is called in UCC it looks in the unrealtournament file\
      \ for all the EditPackages lines and checks to see if those files are already\
      \ compiled to the system folder as file with the extension \".u\". If an EditPackages\
      \ line is equal to a file that is not compiled to the system folder already,\
      \ then and only then will UCC look for that file in the classes folder within\
      \ a folder in your ut directory of the exact name that the EditPackes line is\
      \ equal to. Thus, you have created this directory in the manor you have.</p>\n\
      <p>Now you will add another EditPackages line to the list. It will read, <i>\"\
      EditPackages=XLowGrav\"</i>.</p>\n<p>Remember to put your EditPackages line\
      \ at the bottom, beneath all the others, or you'll get Compiler errors. (make\
      \ sure when you save the unrealtournamet.ini that notepad doesn't add \".txt\"\
      \ to the end of it.)</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Compile_that_sucker.21\"\
      >Compile that sucker!</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As soon as you see that you have successfully compiled\
      \ your first mod, you will want to open it right away and test it. Wait! You\
      \ need to make one more file so it will show up as a mutator in the game. After\
      \ you compile this come back and read the section after this one (Make your\
      \ .int file) to make that file.</p>\n<p>Open a command prompt box (yes you can\
      \ still do this in XP, start/run/cmd and hit enter) and change directory (\"\
      cd\") to the ut system folder. Type \"ucc make\" and UCC will compile your script\
      \ to a \".u\" file and save it in your system folder. When its done you will\
      \ see that tells you there were no errors and no warnings. You can close that\
      \ prompt box now and complete the next and final step.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      /Legacy:INT_File\" title=\"Legacy:INT File\">INT file</a> it finds in the system\
      \ folder. So your int has to be there when UT loads. If UT is running, close\

    text: "This tutorial aims to get you hands experience making actual modifications\
      \ to the game. It is geared toward [[Legacy:UT|UT]] although some of it might\
      \ apply to [[Legacy:UT2003|UT2003]] as well, I don't have that in mind while\
      \ writing this. This tutorial assumes you have completed the following initial\
      \ steps.\n\n# [[Legacy:Setting Up UnrealScript|Setting Up UnrealScript]] &ndash;\
      \ you have to do this before anything else anyway.\n# [[Legacy:UnrealScript\
      \ Hello World|UnrealScript Hello World]] &ndash; get your feet wet.\n\n==Overview==\n\
      \nNow you are ready to proceed. First of all let's start with modding the game\
      \ in a way that the game's developers have actually provided for in a direct\
      \ fashion. '''They included in the game a module named [[Legacy:Mutator (UT)|Mutator\
      \ (UT)]] and it is intended for this purpose.''' This is by no means anywhere\
      \ near the limit to what you can do. If it was, the wiki would have been complete\
      \ in a day. This module contains functions that override functions in other\
      \ parts of the game. For example look at this function from that module:\n\n\
      <uscript>\nfunction bool CheckReplacement(Actor Other, out byte bSuperRelevant)\n\
      {\n\treturn true;\n}\n</uscript>\n\nThis function is in the Mutator module to\
      \ allow you to mutate an actor as the game checks through the actors in the\
      \ map to see if they are to to be replaced. Here you can replace one actor with\
      \ another. You can replace all weapons with one particular weapon if you like\
      \ (but if this what you want to do then study up on the Arena mutator as most\
      \ of the work is done for you already there). This function will be called and\
      \ all the code in it will be executed. You can do pretty much anything you want\
      \ to here as it is an opportunity for your code to be executed. \n\nOne mutator\
      \ included with the game is [[Legacy:LowGrav|LowGrav]]. This mutator uses the\
      \ CheckReplacement() function as an opportunity to modify all instances of [[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]]\
      \ in any map that loads. It also uses this function to get rid of all [[Legacy:UT\
      \ JumpBoots|UT JumpBoots]] in the map. That's all the mutator does. It's one\
      \ function long. But that function is in a subclass of Mutator named LowGrav.\
      \ It inherits all the rest of the code from Mutator so the rest of the work\
      \ is already done. See [[Legacy:Object Oriented Programming Overview|Object\
      \ Oriented Programming Overview]] for more on this, and [[Legacy:Mutator Topics|Mutator\
      \ Topics]] for more on mutators in general.\n \n\n==Project Defined==\n\nThis\
      \ is a good first mod for you, because you can study the mutator you make here\
      \ against the mutator you changed to make this one. And you can study the [Mutator]\
      \ module itself which is the class that the LowGrav class extends. \n\nOkay,\
      \ lets do it. The LowGrav mutator is popular and surely you have played on a\
      \ low grav server. This server runs the LowGrav mutator and that's how it does\
      \ it. On one of these servers you may have encountered a place you wanted to\
      \ get to, but low gravity only afforded you to get almost high enough but not\
      \ quite enough to reach that spot. '''We are going to make the XLowGrav mutator.'''\
      \ This will be exactly like the LowGrav mutator but you will be able to jump\
      \ quite a bit higher, and cover more map when you jump forward from a high point\
      \ then you could in LowGrav.\n\n===Make your working directory===\n\nFirst you\
      \ need to [[Legacy:Set Up Package Folders|Set Up Package Folders]] where you\
      \ will place your code for UCC to compile it from. In your UnrealTournament\
      \ [[Legacy:Base Directory|Base Directory]], make a new folder named \"XLowGrav\"\
      . Open that folder and make a new folder inside named \"Classes\". This Classes\
      \ folder is where you will save your code for UCC to find later.\n\n===Open\
      \ the file that will be used as your template===\n\nOpen the Botpack folder\
      \ then open the Classes folder within. You should see the modules here named\
      \ LowGrav.uc. If not you need to go back two steps and complete both the prerequisits\
      \ for this tutorial. If you do see it there, then open it up with your [[Legacy:Text\
      \ Editor|text editor]].\n\n===Edit the template===\n\nAll the lines at the top\
      \ that start with double slashes are comment lines and you can put what ever\
      \ message you want here as long as you don't use the word ''class''. It will\
      \ be ignored by the game. So take a second and make this mutator your own. Change\
      \ the name there from ''LowGrav'' to ''XLowGrav'' and change the description\
      \ to say ''EXTRA low gravity''. This next part is important. Change the line\
      \ \n\n<uscript>\n class LowGrav expands Mutator;\n</uscript>\n\nto show ''XLowGrav''\
      \ instead of ''LowGrav''. This is the class declaration (see [[Legacy:Class\
      \ Syntax|class syntax]] for more on this). It says that this class is named\
      \ XLowGrav and that it will inherit and/or override any code in its parent class\
      \ named Mutator. \n\nAll you are going to do is edit one number here. Find the\
      \ line\n\n<uscript>\n ZoneInfo(Other).ZoneGravity = vect(0,0,-200);\n</uscript>\n\
      \nand change the ''(0,0,-200)'' to ''(0,0,-100)''. Now save this file as XLowGrav.uc\
      \ (not XLowGrav.uc.txt !!) in the Classes folder you made in your working directory\
      \ for this mod.\n\n===Add your class to the list of classes to be compiled.===\n\
      \nThere it waits for you to compile it with UCC. But you can't yet. First you\
      \ have to leave a note for the compiler to know what all to compile. Open unrealtournament.ini\
      \ in your ut system folder and use the find feature of notepad to locate all\
      \ group of lines that say \"EditPackages=Core\" and such. \n\nEverytime the\
      \ Make commandlet is called in UCC it looks in the unrealtournament file for\
      \ all the EditPackages lines and checks to see if those files are already compiled\
      \ to the system folder as file with the extension \".u\". If an EditPackages\
      \ line is equal to a file that is not compiled to the system folder already,\
      \ then and only then will UCC look for that file in the classes folder within\
      \ a folder in your ut directory of the exact name that the EditPackes line is\
      \ equal to. Thus, you have created this directory in the manor you have. \n\n\
      Now you will add another EditPackages line to the list. It will read, ''\"EditPackages=XLowGrav\"\
      ''.\n\nRemember to put your EditPackages line at the bottom, beneath all the\
      \ others, or you'll get Compiler errors. (make sure when you save the unrealtournamet.ini\
      \ that notepad doesn't add \".txt\" to the end of it.)\n\n===Compile that sucker!===\n\
      \nAs soon as you see that you have successfully compiled your first mod, you\
      \ will want to open it right away and test it. Wait! You need to make one more\
      \ file so it will show up as a mutator in the game. After you compile this come\
      \ back and read the section after this one (Make your .int file) to make that\
      \ file.\n\nOpen a command prompt box (yes you can still do this in XP, start/run/cmd\
      \ and hit enter) and change directory (\"cd\") to the ut system folder. Type\
      \ \"ucc make\" and UCC will compile your script to a \".u\" file and save it\
      \ in your system folder. When its done you will see that tells you there were\
      \ no errors and no warnings. You can close that prompt box now and complete\
      \ the next and final step.\n\n===Make your .int file===\n\nWhen UT launches\
      \ it loads the data in every [[Legacy:INT File|INT file]] it finds in the system\
      \ folder. So your int has to be there when UT loads. If UT is running, close\
      \ it, and restart it after your int file is in the system folder. Open notepad\
      \ and add this data: \n\n<uscript>\n[Public]\nObject=(Name=XLowGrav.XLowGrav,Class=Class,MetaClass=Engine.Mutator,Description=\"\
      Extra Low Gravity\")\n</uscript>\n\nSave this file as XLowGrav.int (not XLowGrav.int.txt)\
      \ in the [[Legacy:Base Directory|Base Directory]]\\system folder. I know you\
      \ have to try it so go ahead and launch UT then you'll see \"Extra Low Gravity\"\
      \ in your mutator list. Have fun, good job, and happy modding. You've come to\
      \ the right place.\n\n==Related Topics ==\n* [[Legacy:UnrealScript Lessons|UnrealScript\
