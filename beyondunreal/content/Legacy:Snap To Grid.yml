      \ most l33t level designers always enable the <i>Snap to Grid</i> feature of\
      \ the UnrealEditor. From experience mappers have noticed that UnrealEd operates\
      \ much better when the <i>Snap to Grid</i> feature is on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Geometric\
      \ brushes line up together perfectly</li>\n<li>Clean joins look professional\
      \ during gameplay</li>\n<li>the 2D view is simpler &amp; easier to understand</li>\n\
      <li>reduced chance of <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP_Hole\" title=\"Legacy:BSP Hole\"\

      \ having to make alterations after every level rebuild (<i>I'm not sure what\
      \ this means, but obviously means something – Tarquin</i> )</li>\n<li>Allows\
      \ Unreal to calculate occlusion factors faster and more efficiently.</li>\n\
      <li>reduces occlusion time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For snap to grid to do all of the\
      \ above, it's important to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the dimensions\
      \ brushes multiples of the grid size. Eg 32, 64, 96, 128 etc.</li>\n<li>Never\
      \ use the <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush_Scaling\" title=\"Legacy:Brush Scaling\">brush\
      \ scaling</a> tool to resize brushes. In UnrealEd 2 it's buggy and will increase\
      \ your brush's dimensions by grid fractions. Use <a href=\"/Legacy:Vertex_Editing\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Vertex Editing\">vertex editing</a> mode instead.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>Most importantly, when your brushes are aligned to the grid, that horror,\
      \ BSP Holes are relatively infrequent, or totally absent from the map.</p>\n\

      <p>Too bad that snapping to values with decimal places doesn't work lowering\
