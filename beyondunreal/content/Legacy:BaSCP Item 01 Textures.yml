      <p>I went and did a google search to find images, I wanted some kind of soil,\
      \ and some mud, considering my theme, I had to choose something that looked\
      \ like it would fit. <b>(Refer to Tiles #01, and #02 below)</b></p>\n<p>I wasn't\
      \ overly thrilled with the images, they were not quite what I had in mind, but\
      \ I had spent enough time searching, and there was lots yet to be done.</p>\n\
      <p><i>It should be noted that I used a lot higher resolution image than shown\
      \ here</i></p>\n<p>I used the ISampler function of Texture Maker (see <a href=\"\
      /edit/Legacy:BaSCP_Tools_Links?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:BaSCP\
      \ Tools Links (page does not exist)\">BaSCP Tools Links</a>) to make the textures\
      \ seemless, it can be found under the tools drop down menu, and is labeled Isampler\
      \ Resynthesis.</p>\n<p>I normally use the settings shown in <b>Tile #03</b>,\
      \ but feel free to tweak it to your hearts desire, <i>Note: if you don't already\
      \ have a seemless texture, make sure the ignore borders checkbox is ticked,\
      \ otherwise you will get a very ugly texture.</i></p>\n<p>From the above images\
      \ I made the textures found in <b>Tile #04, and #05</b>.</p>\n<p>I also made\
      \ an alpha texture.</p>\n<p>Using Texture Maker, I ran off 3x 512x512 new images,\
      \ I used the <b>Generator' <i>function with the preset</i></b> <i>BumpMap</i>\
      \ at its default settings, and stored all 3 on my hard drive.</p>\n<p>I opened\
      \ them up in photoshop, and made a new 512x512 image that was 8-bit GreyScale,\
      \ I went to the <b>Layers' <i>tab on one of the floating toolbars, and clicked\
      \ the button</i></b> <i>Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer<b>, and chose</b>\
      \ Gradient</i>, I selected a black through white greyscale gradeint and made\
      \ it radial, so that I had a white dot in the center of a black background which\
      \ was smoothly blending between the grey scale.</p>\n<p>For the 3 images that\
      \ I had made in texture maker, I went to the <b>Channels</b> tab on the same\
      \ floating toolbar, and added an extra channel, I then copied the dot into this\
      \ new channel for each of them.</p>\n<p>I then made a 512x512 RGB image.</p>\n\
      <p>I went back to the images from texture maker, and with the 4th channel selected\
      \ and visible (the grey dot), I clicked the <b>Load Channel as Selection</b>,\
      \ I then changed back to the main RGB Channel, and copied, I went to the new,\
      \ blank image that I had just made (the RGB image), and pasted what I had copied\
      \ into the red channel, the 2nd texture from texture make I repeated the process,\
      \ except I copied it into the green channel, and the third Texture Maker image\
      \ into the blue channel.</p>\n<p>I could have kept going with the textures,\
      \ but I decided to change courses here and produce a static mesh to test them\
      \ out in game, there were reasons for this, and they were that I was not overly\
      \ happy with this result, I tend to muck around a lot when making things, and\
      \ you should be aware that changing tasks (and in my case moving around the\
      \ house between computers) slows things down, effeciency can be important to\

      \ like <b>Tile #06</b>.</p>\n<p>After this I was done with textures.</p>\n<h3><span\
