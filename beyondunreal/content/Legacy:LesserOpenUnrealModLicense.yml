      \ under this license you have to include the above license with your mod and\
      \ add the following to every source file:\n\n    <name of the program>\n   \
      \ Copyright (C) <year(s) of completion> <name of author>\n    \n    This program\
      \ is free software; you can redistribute and/or modify \n    it under the terms\
      \ of the Lesser Open Unreal Mod License version 1.1.\n\n'''Important note'''\n\
      \nIf you release your whole mod under this license it will also cover all other\
      \ assets like maps, meshes, etc. If you do not want this you can dual license\
      \ your mod (e.g. use this license for the code and a non-free license for maps).\n\
      \n==FAQ==\n\n===Why should I ''not'' use this license but the [[Legacy:OpenUnrealModLicense|OUML]]?===\n\
      \nThis license permits others from using your work in their non-free software.\
      \ They could profit from your work without you getting anything in return.\n\
      \n==Other versions==\n\n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Version 1.0]]\
      \ - deprecated\n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Version 1.1]] - current\n\
      \n==Related pages==\n\n* [[Legacy:OpenUnrealModLicense|OpenUnrealModLicense]]\
      \ - Similar license, this one allows linking with non-free work\n* [[Legacy:Open\
      \ Source|Open Source]]\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''El Muerte:''' removed the first\
      \ paragraf of section 5, thus permitting to link with everything.\n\n'''Snake.PLiSKiN:'''\
      \ Has any one really read the EULA?  (Open the file \\UT200x\\System\\'''License.int'''\
      \ in windows notepad) And read section \"'''11. Editor and End user Mods.'''\"\
      , Im pretty sure it is a violation for any mod to have any type of copyrighted\
      \ material.  I really think that someone should contact epic and get a statement\
      \ on this matter. Because I think epic didnt want for people to sue one another\
      \ because one mod used some of the work in another mod. Everything that does\
      \ not require having a license of the Unreal Engine, can be easily decompiled,\
      \ if a mod author didnt like that, they need to purchase a license.  If you\
      \ want to really copyright your work, you need to pay for the right to do so\
      \ is how I take it after reading the EULA.\n\n'''El Muerte:''' read this: [[Legacy:Mod\
      \ Copyright|Mod Copyright]], it explains it all."
