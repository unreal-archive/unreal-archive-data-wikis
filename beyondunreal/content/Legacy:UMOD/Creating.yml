      <p>When you're developing a mod or a mutator it's always a good idea to automate\
      \ as much of the creation process as possible; that includes the creation of\
      \ distribution packages.</p>\n<p>There are a couple of very pragmatic reasons\
      \ for that: Firstly, it's more convenient for you on the long run; secondly,\
      \ once you have automated and validated the process you don't have to bother\
      \ with whether the created files are complete and working in future; thirdly,\
      \ last-minute changes and fixes are much more easily and conveniently applied\
      \ if all you have to do to pack your distribution packages is a single double-click\
      \ on a batch file.</p>\n<p>You can use <a href=\"/Legacy:Umod_Wizard\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Umod Wizard\">umod Wizard</a> to have the .ini and .int files created\
      \ necessary for making an <a href=\"/Legacy:UMOD\" title=\"Legacy:UMOD\">UMOD</a>\
      \ installer. Then use the following batch file (for Windows):</p>\n<pre>:: UCCMaster.bat\
      \ \n\n@echo off\nif \"%1\" == \"\" goto end\n\ncopy Manifest.* OldManifest.*\n\
      ucc.exe master %1\ndel Manifest.*\ncopy OldManifest.* Manifest.*\ndel OldManifest.*\n\
      \n:end</pre>\n<p>Place this file in Unreal Tournament's System directory and\
      \ simply drop your custom .ini file for <a href=\"/Legacy:UMOD\" title=\"Legacy:UMOD\"\
      >UMOD</a> creation on it. To automatize even this step, create another small\
      \ batch file that calls <tt>UCCMaster.bat</tt> with the .ini file being its\
      \ first command line argument.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"UMOD_files_for_UT2003:_UT2MOD\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: UMOD files for UT2003: UT2MOD\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Creating UT2MOD files is basically\
      \ the same as creating a UMOD file. Actually the only difference is the file's\
      \ extension and UT2003 as requirement instead of Unreal Tournament.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b>\
      \ You should not only create YourMod.ini and YourMod.int for creating your UT2MOD\
      \ file, but also YourMod.det, .est, .frt, .itt, .kot, .smt and .tmt (just copy\
      \ YourMod.int for that). Otherwise localized versions of UT2003 will display\
      \ your mod as \"Unreal Tournament 2003\" complete with Epic Games as developer\
      \ and the UT2003 website. This problem is caused by a Manifest.det, .frt, etc.\
      \ in the UT2003\\System directory which doesn't really belong there. It'll override\
      \ the settings in YourMod.int unless you override them yourself with the corresponding\
      \ YourMod localization file.</p>\n<p>Instead of creating physical copies of\
      \ YourMod.int (for the .det, .frt etc. versions), you can use the following\
      \ statements in your UT2MOD file's Manifest.ini to have \"ucc master\" create\
      \ them for you automatically when packing the UT2MOD file:</p>\n<pre> Copy=(Src=System\\\
      Manifest.ini,Flags=3)\n Copy=(Src=System\\Manifest.int,Master=System\\Manifest.int,Flags=3)\n\
      \ Copy=(Src=System\\Manifest.det,Master=System\\Manifest.int,Flags=3)\n Copy=(Src=System\\\
      Manifest.est,Master=System\\Manifest.int,Flags=3)\n Copy=(Src=System\\Manifest.frt,Master=System\\\

      \ Copy=(Src=System\\Manifest.kot,Master=System\\Manifest.int,Flags=3)\n Copy=(Src=System\\\
