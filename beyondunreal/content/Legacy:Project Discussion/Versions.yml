      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> I'm not so sure. While there were huge changes between UT\
      \ -&gt; UT200x, from what I have heard, the new Unreal engine version in UT2007\
      \ will be completely different; a top-down restructuring. We might have to get\

      \ this relative noober, I think it would be best to really stamp the difference\
      \ on it. Maybe go so far as to have a whole separate wiki with, say, a green\
      \ skin instead of blue for pages that apply to UT2007. Coming to this wiki last\
      \ year, I had (and continue to have) a lot of trouble figuring out what stuff\

      \ away from the wiki ethos, but I think it could be great to have a series of\

      \ applies to UT2007, UT2004, UT2003, UT...</p>\n<p>On the one hand that looks\
      \ too structured for a wiki, on the other, structure seems to be the biggest\
      \ bugbear here. The tiny amount of editorial input that such a checkbox system\

      \ point of view it should always be possible to indicate what version the information\
      \ applied to.</p>\n<p>The way I'd see it progressing from there is that the\
      \ checkboxes could show up on the reader's interface too, and irrelevant pages\
      \ simply aren't returned, or are sorted to the end of search results. Whether\
      \ done by checkboxes or by a whole separate wiki, over time, there would be\
      \ a UT2007 wiki plus a bunch of older material that could be used to draw from\
      \ when the UT2007 wiki draws a blank.</p>\n<p><b>Fyfe:</b> El Muerte had a better\
