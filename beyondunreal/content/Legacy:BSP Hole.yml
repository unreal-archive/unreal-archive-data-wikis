      <li>If you haven't added any zone portals to your map yet then do so - this\

      \ Mirrors effects.</li>\n<li>Make sure that all of the your zone portals are\
      \ added to the level last - see <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush_Order\" title=\"Legacy:Brush\
      \ Order\">Brush Order</a>.</li>\n<li>Are your semi-solids added to the level\
      \ after your adds and subtracts? I've seen strange Hall of Mirrors and clipping\
      \ problems with semi-solids aligned perfectly/overlapping with subtracted and\
      \ added brushes.</li>\n<li>Take a quick tour of your level in the editor and\
      \ see if you can re-arrange the order of the brushes (move as many subtracts\
      \ to the start as you can). Be careful when doing this - you can shaft your\
      \ level if you are not careful.</li>\n<li>Do you have zone portals overlapping\
      \ areas that were subtracted after the zone portal was added?</li>\n<li>Have\

      <dl>\n<dd>I've got two problems: 1. I have invisible collision hulls randomly\
      \ appearing in my maps and I can't get rid of them; 2. The dreaded Hall of Mirrors\
      \ randomly appears too, HELP ME!!!</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd Answers:</b></p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dd>Mmmmm, nice problems. The worst case I've ever had of Hall of Mirrors\
      \ and unwanted collisions was when building DOM-Cruising. The map is based on\
      \ two boats traveling through the water. The boats are solid brushes hollowed\
      \ out to make room for the stuff \"below deck\". The first time I built the\
      \ map I simply placed a zone portal (for the water) across the entire level.\
      \ This gave me the sort of pain you describe. In the end I had to add my zone,\
      \ subtract my solid boat brush (to make a boat shaped hole in the zone), and\
      \ then re-add the boat brush.</dd>\n<dd>Have you ordered all of your zone portals\
      \ to be the last things processed? That can sometimes help. If you haven't zoned\
      \ your level yet then consider doing so - Zoning affects the positions Hall\
      \ of Mirrors and ICHs appear. Messing about with the order of geometry can also\
      \ sometimes help - but be careful with it - you can royally screw up your level\
      \ doing it.</dd>\n<dd>Are the Hall of Mirrors and ICHs appearing in areas of\
      \ particular complexity? If so, can you reduce the compexity of that area? Have\
      \ you got any semi-solids intersecting (or with one surface touching) a solid\
      \ brush? I've had that cause me real pain (I was building celing lights).</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> How on earth can ICHs appear at random? You mean you're\
      \ getting blocked by invisible stuff? That's a <strong class=\"selflink\">BSP\
      \ Hole</strong></p>\n<p><b>Ragdoll:</b> A good way of detecting collision BSP\
      \ errors (you fall through a floor) is to enable show paths. Paths will not\
      \ form over dodgy BSP.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Comments\"\

      \ geometry that often resultsin inexplicable mapholes. This may not work in\
      \ all instances for bsp holes, but it's working in mine at least. If a complex\
      \ piece of brush work is causing BSP holes, I take the complex section and intersect\
      \ a cube onto it to turn it into a single brush. I turn that single brush into\
      \ a static mesh and then place the static mesh where I want it. Then, I convert\
      \ it back into a brush. Align the brush with the static mesh. Delete the mesh,\
      \ deintersect the brush and add. Seems to work quite effectively. But I worry\
      \ about any potential performance issues resulting from this. The result has\
      \ a lot more cuts through the brush, so unless someone can do some stress testing\
      \ to see how much of a performance hit this is, use it sparingly.</p>\n<h2><span\

  wikitext:
    text: "A '''BSP hole''' is an error in the [[Legacy:BSP Tree|BSP Tree]] which\
      \ results in visual and physical errors when editing and playing a map.\n\n\
      ==Symptoms==\n\nHoles can manifest themselves as:\n* a player can walk through\
      \ walls and fall through floors. \n* a spot of the map where the player dies\
      \ for no reason\n* an invisible obstacle\n* leaking zones: level full of water\
      \ for example. These tend to happen when zone sheets touch complex brushes.\
      \ First check the the [[Legacy:Zone Portal|zone portal]] brush is large enough\
      \ to properly seal off the zone.\n* a surface which doesn't display the texture\
      \ properly by revealing:\n** parts of the map which shouldn't be visible from\
      \ that location\n** a black area in UnrealEd's 3D viewport which produces a\
      \ [[Legacy:HOM|HOM]] (hall of mirrors) effect in the game. \n\nIf the surface\
      \ belongs to a [[Legacy:Semisolid|semisolid]] brush, see [[Legacy:Semisolid\
      \ Errors|semisolid errors]].\n\n[[Image:Legacy_legaltoon_goblin_bsphole.gif|center|An\
      \ error in the BSP tree affects part of a wall and floor.  A black hole or \"\
      hall of mirrors\" is the result.]]\n\n==Locate the Offender==\n\nFind the hole\
      \ in Zone/Portal view. The edges of the hole correspond to a BSP cut. Identifying\
      \ which part of the geometry makes this cut can often solve the problem.\n\n\
      ===The Mychaeel Patented BSP Hole Detector===\n\nIt's much easier to spot Hall\
      \ of Mirrors in maps if the screen is covered with a translucent red fog; at\
      \ Hall of Mirrors locations, the fog builds up to a solid red blotch and makes\
      \ discovering Hall of Mirrors pretty easy. You can achieve this with the following\
      \ console command, which you can also achieve with [[Legacy:Binding Keys|binding\
      \ keys]]:\n set PlayerPawn ConstantGlowFog (X=0.3)\n\n==Possible Cures==\n\n\
      ===Rearrange===\n* Put brushes on the grid (see [[Legacy:Keeping Brushes Snapped\
      \ To The Grid|Keeping brushes snapped to the grid]]). If your brush dimensions\
      \ aren't [[Legacy:Grid|grid]] units (e.g. 100 units wide instead of 96, 112\
      \ or 128, then you have angered the [[Legacy:UnrealEd Goblin|UnrealEd Goblin]].\
      \ You'll have to remake them. Tough.)\n\n* Changing the order often solves the\
      \ problem. If additive brushes get BSP errors then it often helps if you put\
      \ them to the end of the BSP rebuild sequence. \n** Select the diseased brush,\
      \ ''Right Click''. If it is a subtractive brush move it 'to first'. If it is\
      \ an additive brush move it 'to last'.\n** Export the brush and delete. Add\
      \ again during a later rebuild.\n* Change the way the geometry is put together:\
      \ use subtracts in a different way.\n\n===Simplify===\n\nEither outright simplify\
      \ the geometry in the area, or add a [[Legacy:Zone Portal|zone portal]] somewhere\
      \ judicious, thus splitting one zone into two smaller ones. This way the geometry\
      \ inside the zone won't be that complex.\n\n===Make It Permanent===\n\nWhen\
      \ brushes are rotated, stretched or vertex edited, it is important the changes\
      \ are made set to [[Legacy:Transform Permanently|transform permanently]].  Anything\
      \ not made permanent is prone to introduce math errors, which is inherited to\
      \ the BSP Tree when built.\n\n===Semisolids===\n\nUse more [[Legacy:Semisolid|semisolid]]s\
      \ for decoration or brushes a player/bot cant reach \n\n'''Ragdoll:''' As i\
      \ said over on the [[Legacy:Semisolid|Semisolid]] Page, the use of semisolids\
      \ where the player wont touch them is a myth. Use semis as much as possible\
      \ for a low node count, although there are limitations.\n\n===Merge Polygons===\n\
      \nJust recently when I was making a \"cloud\" for my level, I went to rebuild\
      \ my geometry and then there were about 5 to 10 BSP holes! With frustration,\
      \ I aligned the textures on the cloud and then I merged the polygons. After\
      \ that, for a reason I don't know why, the BSP holes vanished!\n\n===Desperation===\n\
      * Move the brush that is causing the BSP hole some minor distance. \n* [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?threadid=88347\
      \ 88347] on how to manage BSP cuts\n* [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?threadid=75868\
      \ 75868] (I know I'm lazy,hopefully somebody will sum up).\n* Offer the Unreal\
      \ Goblin your car keys. ''Stupid Grin''\n* Try to reduce [[Legacy:Node Count|node\
      \ count]] (no idea why)\n\n===Last Resort===\n\nThe sliders in the [[Legacy:Build|Build]]\
      \ window should be your last solution. \n\n===But wait! [[Legacy:Evil_blue_dude|evil_blue_dude]]\
      \ has found an experimental method to solving this!===\n\nSay you have a floor\
      \ that your are falling through. [[Legacy:Evil_blue_dude|evil_blue_dude]] would\
      \ suggest [[Legacy:Brush Sinking|brush sinking]] another brush (doesn't have\
      \ to be complex, just a cube will do) into the offending floor, and add, retexture/align,\
      \ etc.\n\nWon't even know it as there.\n\nOK. [[Legacy:Evil_blue_dude|evil_blue_dude]]\
      \ is done with his spree of shameless self promotion.\n\n==Prevention==\n\n\
      ===Stay on the grid===\n\nKeep brushes snapped to the grid. Use multiples of\
      \ powers of 2 for dimensions, so vertices are on the grid too.\n\nTry and keep\
      \ a large grid size: 32 or 16 should be fine for most brushwork; drop down to\
      \ 8, 4 or 2 for fine detail.\n\nOf course this is not always possible (especially\
      \ when you want to add details) but it's better to keep the exceptions at a\
      \ minimal level. Also on that note think in the powers of 2 when working with\
      \ your maps, like 2-4-8-16-32-64-128...\n\n===Semisolids===\n\nUse [[Legacy:Semisolid|semisolid]]\
      \ brushes for complex architecture:\n* [[Legacy:Making Arches|Making Arches]]\n\
      * [[Legacy:Making Stairs|Making Stairs]]\n\n===Keep it simple===\n\nIf an 8\
      \ sided cylinder will do, don't bother with 16 or 32 sides. Add curved brushes\
      \ as semisolids.\n\n===Desperation===\n* The last resort is to intersect/deintersect\
      \ brushes before adding them. If you need to do this, go back to \"stay on the\
      \ grid\" above.\n\n* If you're using the [[Legacy:Grid|grid]] there's no need\
      \ to intersect since everything will join perfectly; if you're off-grid you're\
      \ doomed anyway.\n\n* Overlapping brushes do not create BSP errors.\n\n==Technical==\n\
      \nBrush collision information is assigned incorrectly by the BSP compiler and\
      \ UnrealEd then displays the BSP anomaly that interferes with gameplay.  BSP\
      \ holes can be either missing sections of additive brushes (usually a rectangular\
      \ section of wall) that you can see through to geometry that should be occluded\
      \ from your perspective; or, the 3D Grid ''Black Space'' triangle interposed\
      \ usually at the confluence of two brushes. They're UGLY and terrifying. \n\n\
      You can see BSP holes in the Zone Portal view; and not in the BSP cuts view.\
      \ And, you can view information about BSP Tree depth in the Rebuild/Level Statistics.<br\
      \ />\n\nSee, a description of [[Legacy:BSP Tree|BSP Tree]] for clarification\
      \ of the mechanics involved.\n\n==Questions and Answers==\n\n===Strange BSP\
      \ Hole When Rebuilding All===\n\n'''Question:''' \n\nWhen I only build the geometry\
      \ there are NO BSP holes. But when I build all there are LOTS of BSP holes!\
      \  Does anybody know how this is possible?  And how I can resolve it?  Thanks!\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd Answers:'''\n* If you haven't added any zone portals to your\
      \ map yet then do so - this changes the BSP tree and will either solve your\
      \ problem or move the Hall of Mirrors effects.\n* Make sure that all of the\
      \ your zone portals are added to the level last - see [[Legacy:Brush Order|Brush\
      \ Order]].\n* Are your semi-solids added to the level after your adds and subtracts?\
      \  I've seen strange Hall of Mirrors and clipping problems with semi-solids\
      \ aligned perfectly/overlapping with subtracted and added brushes.\n* Take a\
      \ quick tour of your level in the editor and see if you can re-arrange the order\
      \ of the brushes (move as many subtracts to the start as you can).  Be careful\
      \ when doing this - you can shaft your level if you are not careful.\n* Do you\
      \ have zone portals overlapping areas that were subtracted after the zone portal\
      \ was added?\n* Have a look at the [[Legacy:Help Desk|Help Desk]] page - there\
      \ are some other Hall of Mirrors type problems on there.\n:Apart from that,\
      \ see if you can identify the piece of geometry that is causing the error and\
      \ either remove it, or see if you can simplify it in some way.  Good luck.\n\
      \n===Random Invisible Collision Hulls and Hall of Mirrors===\n\n'''Question:'''\
      \  \n:I've got two problems:  1. I have invisible collision hulls randomly appearing\
      \ in my maps and I can't get rid of them; 2. The dreaded Hall of Mirrors randomly\
      \ appears too, HELP ME!!!\n\n'''EntropicLqd Answers:'''\n:Mmmmm, nice problems.\
      \  The worst case I've ever had of Hall of Mirrors and unwanted collisions was\
      \ when building DOM-Cruising.  The map is based on two boats traveling through\
      \ the water.  The boats are solid brushes hollowed out to make room for the\
      \ stuff \"below deck\".  The first time I built the map I simply placed a zone\
      \ portal (for the water) across the entire level.  This gave me the sort of\
      \ pain you describe.  In the end I had to add my zone, subtract my solid boat\
      \ brush (to make a boat shaped hole in the zone), and then re-add the boat brush.\n\
      :Have you ordered all of your zone portals to be the last things processed?\
      \  That can sometimes help.  If you haven't zoned your level yet then consider\
      \ doing so - Zoning affects the positions Hall of Mirrors and ICHs appear. \
      \ Messing about with the order of geometry can also sometimes help - but be\
      \ careful with it - you can royally screw up your level doing it.\n:Are the\
      \ Hall of Mirrors and ICHs appearing in areas of particular complexity?  If\
      \ so, can you reduce the compexity of that area?  Have you got any semi-solids\
      \ intersecting (or with one surface touching) a solid brush?  I've had that\
      \ cause me real pain (I was building celing lights).\n\n'''Tarquin:''' How on\
      \ earth can ICHs appear at random? You mean you're getting blocked by invisible\
      \ stuff? That's a [[Legacy:BSP Hole|BSP Hole]]\n\n'''Ragdoll:''' A good way\
      \ of detecting collision BSP errors (you fall through a floor) is to enable\
      \ show paths. Paths will not form over dodgy BSP.\n\n==Comments==\n\n(Attribute\
      \ to ChrisToth, most, if not all useful information on BSP Holes, causes, diagnostics,\
      \ and corrective action.)\n\nBSP Holes can also appear after converting a static\
      \ mesh to a brush, and the problem sometimes does line up with the culprit on\
      \ one of the three axis points. ''Web Raines''\n\n'''Tarquin''':  There's a\
      \ lot of very useful technical info that's been moved to the end of it. This\
      \ stuff needs to be reintegrated here, or in [[Legacy:BSP|BSP]] or [[Legacy:BSP\
      \ Tree|BSP Tree]]\n\n'''Lucy''': I've been doing some complex geometry that\
      \ often resultsin inexplicable mapholes. This may not work in all instances\
      \ for bsp holes, but it's working in mine at least. If a complex piece of brush\
      \ work is causing BSP holes, I take the complex section and intersect a cube\
      \ onto it to turn it into a single brush. I turn that single brush into a static\
      \ mesh and then place the static mesh where I want it. Then, I convert it back\
      \ into a brush. Align the brush with the static mesh. Delete the mesh, deintersect\
      \ the brush and add. Seems to work quite effectively. But I worry about any\
      \ potential performance issues resulting from this. The result has a lot more\
      \ cuts through the brush, so unless someone can do some stress testing to see\
      \ how much of a performance hit this is, use it sparingly.\n\n==Related Topics==\n\
