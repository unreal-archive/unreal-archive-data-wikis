      \ editor. (this seems painfully obvious but i know people who had this game\
      \ from the day it was released and never worked that out&#160;:Rolleyes: )</p>\n\
      <p>The first thing is the most commonly asked question ever about unreal ed-\
      \ OMG my map dissapears when i open the editor! the viewports are white ( In\
      \ Devastation editor they show the editor icon that you see when it loads up)\
      \ . RELAX and do view-&gt; viewports-&gt;configure and choose your desired layout.</p>\n\
      <p>And try to remember <a href=\"/Legacy:Team_Number\" title=\"Legacy:Team Number\"\
      >Team Numbers</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Team 0=Conformists=Blue</li>\n<li>Team 1=Resistance=Red</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>When playtesting a multiplayer map from the editor it wont work properly.\
      \ For example, if you playtest a DDM map through the editor if you kill yourself\
      \ you will respawn with no weapons at all-even you hands will dissappear- but\
      \ you can still pick up weapons fine. Dont worry though. It will work fine when\
      \ actually running on the internet.</p>\n<p>As with most other unreal editors\
      \ out there, be prepared for it to crash. Ive outlined some things you shouldnt\
      \ do in this page but still, it can crash and freeze up for no reason at all.\
      \ Save, and save often under different filenames.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ of resources available for you to use.</p>\n<p><b>Static Meshes .USX</b></p>\n\
      <p>The most useful packages in terms on numbers of meshes and variety are the\
      \ DDecoSm packages. Static meshes from individual maps can be found in thier\
      \ respective packages, eg static meshes from rivers of waste can be found in\
      \ the riversofwaste and riversSM packages. or, you could <a href=\"/Legacy:Create_A_Static_Mesh\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Create A Static Mesh\">create a static mesh</a> yourself. There\
      \ seems to be collision bug with the DDecoSMestreetcleaner which allows you\
      \ to walk through it like it wasnt there. Simply add a <a href=\"/Legacy:BlockingVolume\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:BlockingVolume\">BlockingVolume</a> around it to fix the problem.\
      \ If you are creating a <a href=\"/Legacy:SkyBox\" title=\"Legacy:SkyBox\">SkyBox</a>\
      \ you can look in most of the singleplayer packages, or in DSkySM.</p>\n<p>As\
      \ with textures (see below), you should press the \"all\" tab in the corner\
      \ of the browser.</p>\n<p><b>Textures .UTX</b></p>\n<p>The skins for all static\
      \ meshes can be found within the texture browser. There is actually many very\
      \ useful textures, too many to list here, so have a look around in every package\
      \ and see what you can find. In the texture browser, the exclamation mark button\
      \ in the top left hand corner is used to preview what textures will look like\
      \ when put on a surface, IE some textures display moving objects (like a rotating\
      \ fan).</p>\n<p>Its a good idea to press the \"all\" button, that way all groups\
      \ will be displayed at once. Eg, if you open UTAPROPS, all you seen are some\
      \ fan textures, until you press the \"all\" tab.</p>\n<p>Note: DO NOT try to\
      \ open the UTAcode or Scripted tex. They will crash the editor.</p>\n<p>Some\
      \ useful textures</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zone portal texture BuildHelpTex.Zoneportaltex</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>(more to add when i have a proper look round later)</p>\n<p><b>Prefabs\
      \ .U</b></p>\n<p>For some reason, you cannot access the prefab browser from\
      \ directly under the view menu. So, go into the <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_Class_Browser\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Actor Class Browser\">Actor class browser</a> and select the\
      \ prefabs tab. You can view most of the prefabs by pressing the AllPkgs button\
      \ (i dont recommend pressing the AllGrps button though. It usually crashes the\
      \ editor). Have a look through different decoration packages and see what you\
      \ can find. You can add prefabs to you map using the middle mouse button, or\
      \ by right clicking in a 3d viewport in wireframe mode.</p>\n<p><b>Sounds .UAX</b></p>\n\
      <p>Most of the sound packages contain the character voices used in individual\
      \ levels, eg SP1M1 cointains all the voice effects used in the first mission.\
      \ . Use an <a href=\"/Legacy:AmbientSound\" title=\"Legacy:AmbientSound\">AmbientSound</a>\
      \ to implement a sound in your level.</p>\n<p>Most useful sounds (laser fence\
      \ hacking alarm, flag capture etc) are found in UDAmbeint, although you will\
      \ have to press the \"all\" tab.</p>\n<p><b>Actor Classes .u</b></p>\n<p>Most\
      \ of the useful actors are found in the DTerritories package. If, when you go\
      \ to select the <a href=\"/Legacy:Gametype\" title=\"Legacy:Gametype\">Gametype</a>,all\
      \ you see is Dgameinfo, then you need to open the DTerritories package to see\
      \ the full range of game types available. The territories package also contains\
      \ many of the emitters.</p>\n<p>You will also need to open this package in the\
      \ browser to load the DLaserfence and DLoadout volumes.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ scaling.</p>\n<p>From what i can tell, this is a very unusual problem which\
      \ I encountered recently (not for the first time) that makes it impossible to\
      \ build geometry. Its hard to explain, lets say that you make the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Red_Builder_Brush\" title=\"Legacy:Red Builder Brush\">red builder brush</a>\
      \ 512x512x512 and then add it to the world, the actual dimensions of the added\
      \ brush will come out as maybe 512x512x480. That is, the added brush is smaller\
      \ than the proper size it should be defined by the builder brush, in one or\
      \ more directions.</p>\n<p>I cant really be more specific, lets just say youll\
      \ know if you encounter this.</p>\n<p>You can fix it very easily by accessing\
      \ the builder brushes properties -&gt;dispay and resetting the \"drawscale 3D\"\
      \ settings all back to 1. The last time this happened to me, one of the drawscale\
      \ settings was 1.2 instead of one, making the actual brush added (or subtracted)\
