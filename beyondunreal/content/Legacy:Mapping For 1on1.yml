  title: "Legacy:Mapping For 1on1"
  text:
    text: "<p>1on1 deathmatch levels are arguably the hardest to make well. A 1on1\
      \ has the tightest margin of error when dealing with flow problems, because\
      \ the player is more often navigating your level than shooting at her opponent.\
      \ When a 1on1 map has lousy flow–it's hard to climb that ramp, you get stuck\
      \ on some trivial decoration–then it's not just a \"lame bit\" on your map,\
      \ it's a serious inbitor to gameplay.</p>\n<p>Most deathmatch map, but especially\
      \ 1-on-1 deathmatch maps, are based on a series of major and minor nodes. If\
      \ you run around in them it's pretty easy to tell where they are. Major nodes\
      \ are typically multi-level rooms with more than two entrances and maybe some\
      \ goodie in the middle to tempt people.</p>\n<p>Minor nodes are the rooms that\
      \ usually hold health, powerups, weapons, and most of the PlayerSpawns. Minor\
      \ nodes are tpyically escape routes, side halls, reloading spots, spawn areas,\
      \ and \"unimportant\" rooms. This is where you load up before hunting down the\
      \ enemy.</p>\n<p>A typical 1on1 map has between two and five major nodes and\
      \ no more than twice that in minor nodes.</p>\n<p>A 1on1 map is unique in that\
      \ it's just you, your enemy, and the level you're fighting in. When you aren't\
      \ worrying about a bunch of other players shooting you in the face, you can\
      \ spend time trying to figure out where your enemy is. For instance, all the\
      \ pickups make a very distinct noise when collected (health vials, for some\
      \ reason, are particularly loud and easy to pick out), so you can often determine\
      \ where your opponent is by what things they pick up. You can also track them\
      \ by the swath of missing pickups (ammo, health, damage amps, etc...) and figure\
      \ out their cycle around the map. Anyway, the point is, a 1on1 game is much\
      \ more of a sneaky game of ambush and thinking, rather than quick trigger fingers\
      \ and flak cannons (those things help, too, you know).</p>\n<p>When making a\
      \ 1on1 map, you should be thinking about how you'd want to <i>play</i> a 1on1\
      \ map. The first step should be to make a little diagram of the different major\
      \ nodes you want, and figure out how you want them to be connected. Mark where\
      \ you want elevators, important powerups, multilevel rooms, and rooms that have\
      \ one-way shortcuts to other locations (teleporters, dropshafts, etc.).</p>\n\
      <p>The second step is to think about how you want the major nodes to flow together\
      \ with minor nodes. This, for me, is the hardest part. In many 1on1 maps, the\
      \ lines are blurred between connector and node. Many 1on1 maps have little symmetry–\
      all the doors and halls are unique. This helps add more flavor than what would\
      \ otherwise exist on such a small map, and it makes the map seem somewhat bigger\
      \ than it otherwise would.</p>\n<p>When you develop the overall design, you\
      \ should think about where you want noisemakers. Noisemakers would be any powerup\
      \ that makes a distinctive noise, or some bit of the environment that reveals\
      \ the location of the player that triggered it. Adding noisemakers makes a 1on1\
      \ map much more interesting. It also plays into the risk-vs-reward principle\
      \ of mapping, since a player must decide if grabbing that keg o' health is worth\
      \ walking through that noisy puddle and revealing their location.</p>\n<h2><span\
