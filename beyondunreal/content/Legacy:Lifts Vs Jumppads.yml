      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Jumppads are almost always (generalizations are bad)\
      \ faster than lifts. A player can not easily elude a pursuer since a jumppad\
      \ simply modifies the players location and has little effect on breaking up\
      \ continuity of pursuit. There's a slight break in the action as each player\
      \ modifies their aim.</p>\n<p>If not pursuing directly behind the player, hitting\
      \ a player using a jumppad can be extremely difficult if the player isn't familiar\
      \ with the level.</p>\n<p>Jumppads have greater mobility and flexability that\
      \ lifts. If you see a person below you when jumped from a jumppad, you can kill\
      \ him, but when you are on the lift, your line of fire may be blocked by the\
      \ lift that you are standing on, depending on it's size and shape.</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Lifts\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Lifts are generally slower. Even a fast moving lift\
      \ usually doesn't offer the same throughput as a jumppad. Lifts can, however,\
      \ be better for escaping from an enemy who is in pursuit. The likliness of successful\
      \ evasion tends to be a proportional to the lift speed and it's exposure. For\
      \ example, an elevator shaft style lift protects the player from his pursuer\
      \ whereas a lift in an open area makes the lift a dangerous commitment.</p>\n\
      <p>Special care should be taken with lifts on CTF levels. If a flagcarrier takes\
      \ a lift and the pursuer can't get on and exit the lift in a reasonable amount\
      \ of time, the flagcarrier's whereabouts may be unknown if, at the lift exit,\
      \ there are multiple exits. The defender doesn't know whether or not the flagcarrier\
      \ went right or left in such a case. In addition, depending on the speed and\
      \ length of the lift, the flag carrier may end up with a tremendous lead on\
      \ any persons in pursuit. This can apply to other gametypes as well, but primarily\
      \ to CTF and Bombing Run.</p>\n<p>Of greater danger for exposed lifts is that\
      \ an attacker knows his target's movement is constrained to the lift and at\
      \ what speed the lift is moving. This increases the likeliness of the attacker\
      \ hitting his target, particularly with non-tracefire weapons. This is a good\
      \ tactic in DM-Serpentine when you defeat Malcolm. When you see the lift go\
      \ up, and you are in the central area, you can easily lob a flak grenade at\
      \ him for an easy frag.</p>\n<p>A contained lift, however, can offer temporary\
      \ protection to players within it.</p>\n<p>Lastly, lift jumps (hitting jump\
      \ at the peak of a lift's vertical movement) can allow a player to launch themselves\
      \ high into the air. This is due to a quirk in the physics code and will not\
      \ work for <a href=\"/Legacy:Karma\" title=\"Legacy:Karma\">Karma</a>-based\
      \ objects. While the lift goes up the player has great velocity. However, when\
      \ walking, a player is \"stuck\" to the floor. This is easily observed in low\
      \ gravity as your footsteps are not slowed. When the lift stops, the player\
      \ who is \"glued\" to it stops suddenly with the lift, instead of being launched\
      \ off of it as would happen in real life. By jumping at the last second or,\
      \ even worse, by hammer jumping at the last second, you separate yourself from\
      \ the lift and are not stopped by it when it stops. Thus you continue with the\
      \ same upward velocity until gravity pulls you down. On a fast-moving lift,\
      \ you can really go flying, which can catapult a player into an area they would\
      \ not normally be able to reach on foot, or allow a player to land directly\
      \ behind their opponent. It can also be used to make a speedy escape.</p>\n\

      <p>Sometimes you might want a lift that follows a curved pattern. This cannot\
      \ be done using regular movers. However, an ambitious person (other than me&#160;:P)\
      \ could fairly easily write a script for a new type of mover that would follow\
      \ interpolation points. This may or may not work for UT, but for UT2003 it shouldn't\
