      <p>Movies, games, mods, they're all copyrighted to somebody. What does this\
      \ mean? The owner of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/copyright\"\
      \ class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:copyright\">Wikipedia:copyright</a> is guaranteed\
      \ certain privileges to his material. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the exclusive\
      \ right to <b>reproduction</b>,</li>\n<li>the exclusive right to <b>derivative\
      \ works</b>,</li>\n<li>the exclusive right to <b>distribution</b> and</li>\n\
      <li>the exclusive right to <b>public performance and display</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n\
      <p>The most important one, as far as mods go, is the \"exclusive right to derivative\
      \ works.\" A derivative work is anything based on the original copyrighted work.</p>\n\
      <p>A simple example: You can't make an Unreal Tournament mod for Quake III.\
      \ The game, along with the content, is copyrighted to Epic Games. Or... you\
      \ couldn't make an <i>Independence Day</i> mod (you know, the movie...).</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>\"But we are not making profit.\"&#160;</dt>\n<dd>It doesn't matter.\
      \ The owner still retains the right to decide what is done with their material,\
      \ and they even legally <i>have to</i> protect it in order not to create a precedent\
      \ that may cause them to lose it when it <i>really</i> hurts. (And they still\
      \ potentially lose money due to your mod even if you don't make any. But regardless\
      \ of that, \"damage\" is not a concept that comes in where copyright is concerned.)</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>\"What about fair use?\"&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Generally, <a href=\"\
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Fair\
      \ use\">fair use</a> is limited to a reasonably small portion of a work. The\
      \ \"portion\" however depends on the work itself. Using a quote from a book\
      \ on a website wouldn't constitute copyright infringement as it's one sentence\
      \ out of thousands; copying an entire article from that website and using it\
      \ is a different matter though.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>What it comes down to is <b>explicit\
      \ permission.</b> If you don't have it, you can't do it. Some people and companies\
      \ will grant it, others won't. Nintendo, for example, is very strict with their\
      \ quality assurance and doesn't grant permissions to mod developers. On the\
      \ other hand, I recall a mod based on Square's <i>Final Fantasy</i> characters,\
      \ and they had in fact gotten permission to use them. But you’re better off\
      \ getting a letter refusing permission before you start a mod, than getting\
      \ a cease-and-desist letter six months into development.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Mod_Copyright?section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Why Does\
      \ This Matter?\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>Besides being illegal there are several other consequences of copyright infringement\
      \ to consider before starting a mod project. First of all, if you're reading\
      \ this you're <i>probably</i> a coder, level designer, 3D artist, 2D artist,\
      \ or have some other talent associated with game development. And, in the course\
      \ of creating content, you will (or have) put in a huge amount of time and effort\
      \ into your project. And, in the end, the <b>only</b> way of protecting your\
      \ hard work from theft by others is copyright protection. So, with that in mind,\
      \ let's consider a couple of scenarios.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Scenario A&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd></dd>\n</dl>\n<p><br />\nYou and a group of other buddies have worked hard\
      \ for over a year to produce a terrific mod. Then another group of developers\
      \ comes along, rips off all your content, ports it over to a newer engine over\
      \ the course of just a couple of months. And then, after it's release, this\
      \ new mod slowly starts stealing away your fanbase.</p>\n<p>How upset would\
      \ you be? Wouldn't you invoke your rights as the owner of that content and do\
      \ everything in your power to stop it?</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Scenario\
      \ B&#160;</dt>\n<dd>You <i>own</i> the copyright to a commerical game title\
      \ that is your main source of income. You rely on that income to feed your family,\
      \ pay your employees, and buy all your shiny new toys. Then, along comes another\
      \ game that is a direct copy of your title. And, to top it all off, this new\
      \ game is a mod, available for, gasp!, <i>free</i> to any person with an Internet\
      \ connection. So instead of having to <i>buy</i> your game, gamers can download\
      \ another game that's almost the same for <i>free</i>.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Now,\
      \ is it any surprise why game companies won't hesitate to slap you with a \"\
      cease and desist\" order? The newer the game, the greater the danger to mods\
      \ copying that title of being stopped dead in their tracks. Obviously, this\
      \ is less of a danger to mods based on older games, but not necessarily so.\
      \ You never know when a company may be planning on, or is already developing,\
      \ a sequel. And if that's the case, you better believe they'll come after you.</p>\n\
      <p>This is why the <i>\"but nobody's making profit\"</i> argument doesn't work.\
      \ It doesn't matter that <b>you're not making profit.</b> What matters is that\
      \ <b>they're losing profit,</b> and they may even lose their intellectual property\
      \ rights if they don't protect them.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As a development community it is our collective responsibility\
      \ to maintain its health. Not only is it in our best interests to share resources\
      \ and insight, it is equally in our best interests to protect the property of\
      \ its individual members. Tolerating the theft of others property by current\
      \ mod teams encourages that behavior in fledgling teams. And who's to say it\
      \ isn't <i>your</i> property that's stolen next?</p>\n<p>Another factor to consider\
      \ is the simple fact that people with the Talents necessary to publish mods\
      \ are in very short supply. The is only a finite number of mods that can be\
      \ in developement at any one time. Now consider a mod that's assembled a team\
      \ of three or four dedicated guys that have put in hundreds of man-hours of\
      \ work into their project. Then, six months into their work, the receive the\
      \ dreaded \"cease and desist\" order from the game they're copying. All those\
      \ man-hours of work are now wasted, when they could have been used by a mod\
      \ project that has a much better chance of reaching production.</p>\n<p>Producing\
      \ a mod is an <i>incredibly</i> difficult thing to do, and only a miniscule\
      \ percent of mods that get started ever see the light of day. And starting a\
      \ mod that's a copy of another game or movie only adds to that difficulty and\
      \ further reduces you chances of ever releasing, since you're starting with\
      \ a <i>big</i> strike against you. So, every developer that joins the doomed\
      \ project is one less developer that could have been used elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ simple fact is that starting, joining, or even tolerating, mods that violate\
      \ copyright law is detrimental to the community as a whole.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ for doing so. When writing this letter, there are several recommendations\
      \ to getting it noticed and receiving a positive answer.</p>\n<p>When obtaining\
      \ permission to use copyrighted material, get permission for an individual,\
      \ not a team, to use the material. That way, if the mod team splits up, there\
      \ is no ambiguity as to who has permission to continue use of the material.</p>\n\

      \ this. So list your suggestions/questions.</p>\n<p><b>Cookie:</b> Excellent\
      \ Deathwind. This article was desperately needed. I went ahead added a few more\
      \ sections that I felt elaborated on the importance of this issue. Hope you\
      \ don't mind.</p>\n<p><b>BM.Deathwind:</b> Impressive!!&#160;:) I really like\
      \ what you did...</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b> Nicely written. The \"not making\
      \ profit\" myth really needs to be plastered around everywhere. A lot of mod\
      \ groups are fans of X, whether X be Jason movies or Alien movies or Starcraft,\
      \ etc., and realizing such concepts might avoid a legal letter or two.</p>\n\
      <p><b>OverloadUT:</b> What about the topic of the copyright of the mod being\
      \ developed? I expected that to be covered here, but it's not. What I mean is:\
      \ If I release a mod and include a license that says \"You may not use this\
      \ to make dirivative works or modify this code\" and then someone does, do I\
      \ have grounds to press charges? I wouldn't be surprised if you automatically\
      \ give up all rights to your project because it's released for an engine to\
      \ which you do not have a license. Does anybody know the answer to this?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> What's written here about other people's rights to their\
      \ intellectual property naturally applies to mods as well. I've changed the\
      \ first paragraph to make that more obvious. You actually don't even have to\
      \ include a license that states that you own the copyright – you do, by default.</p>\n\
      <p><b>OverloadUT:</b> Okay, I've got a more tricky situation. I'll use a real\
      \ life relevant scenario: I'm making a CTF4 mod, which adds four team support\
      \ to UT2004. This is nice because it allows anyone to make a 4 team mod by using\
      \ my gameclass as a base. But if on release I said that no one is allowed to\
      \ make a mod that uses my code as a base, does that hold? The difference being\
      \ that I have not created anything particuarly innovative. \"4-team gameplay\"\
      \ is probably not something I can copyright. And if someone makes a mod that\
      \ sits on top of my code without actually changing my code or stealing any of\
      \ my code, are they doing anything (legally) wrong? Please note that this is\
      \ simply a question for the sake of knowing the answer. I don't really have\
      \ an issue with someone using CTF4 as a base for another mod.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ It not being innovative or revolutionary is irrelevant. If you wrote a book\
      \ that was essentially an age-old story rehased, you still have copyright over\
      \ it - even if it's \"nothing new.\" Whether or not it's innovative is an issue\
      \ that applies to patent law, which is not the same as copyright.</p>\n<p>However:\
      \ As for whether or not they are doing anything wrong if they derive off of\
      \ your classes and don't include any code: That's a bit tricky, but I think\
      \ it would be legal - after all, their code only makes reference to your work,\
      \ much like Coles notes, or a book report might make reference to your work.</p>\n\
      <p>However, it's not quite the same, since one can still read (make use of)\
      \ a book report without the book in question, while a person would not be able\
      \ to use code that referenced your code without having your (compiled) work.\
      \ In addition, one might logically argue that their package is linked to yours\
      \ at runtime by the virtual machine and thus constitutes a derivative work,\
      \ but I doubt many judges would understand what that means, so.. err, that might\
      \ not work.&#160;;)</p>\n<p>You could, in that case, maybe argue that the license\
      \ does not allow them to view your code, which would be required in order to\
      \ derive from the class. (Unless they claim they just \"guessed\" the function\
      \ names, etc.&#160;;))</p>\n<p>A person might also be able to include a clause\
      \ specifically forbidding such use, (not sure how well that would stand up)\
      \ and you could certainately restrict redistribution, though then they could\
      \ still link and state that you had to download the CTF4 mod separate from theirs.</p>\n\
      <p>Hrm, and if you did that, you could change function and variable names with\
      \ each new release, and if the license only allowed to most recent version to\
      \ be mirrored, then I SUPPOSE you could prevent such behaviour that way. Though\
      \ that's probrably not ideal.</p>\n<p>In the end I think it would mostly come\
      \ down to your (or your lawyers') ability to convince the judge. It seems like\
      \ a person OUGHT TO have control over that sort of thing, but the challenge\
      \ would lie in explaining OOP and how it relates to what the person has done.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Err.. doh! Just thought when I put that edit in; console manufacturers\
      \ like Nintendo have a legal ability to control what games are released for\
      \ their platform: so there is some legal background to the notion that a copyright\
      \ holder can have some control over what software is run on their platform -\
      \ you would only have to argue that your copyrighted work is being used as a\
      \ software platform for another piece of software.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ You can keep people from creating \"derivative works\" of your code (and what's\
      \ a subclass if not, literally, a \"derivative work\"?). However, you have no\
      \ right on the \"four teams\" idea just because you implemented it first – that's\
      \ the difference between <i>copyright</i> and <i>patents</i>. You could (probably,\
      \ sadly) <i>patent</i> the idea of having four teams instead of two fighting\
      \ against each other, but you cannot <i>copyright</i> it – just your code that\
      \ implements it. Anybody else can come up with the same idea and legally implement\
      \ it on their own.</p>\n<p><b>OverloadUT:</b> Okay, that makes sense. Thanks\
      \ for the answers! I think I was getting patents and copyrights confused. I\
      \ have another situation to ponder though: Let's say I wanted to add custom\
      \ loading screens for my mod, based on what map is loading. To do this, I would\
      \ remember that Jailbreak did that very thing, so I would look at that code\
      \ and see how they did it. If I implemented that code in to my mod without permission,\
      \ is that copyright violation? What if I asked for permission and they denied\
      \ it? I mean, I've seen how the code works now, and I could \"rewrite\" the\
      \ code but since their way is the best way to do it, it might end up looking\
      \ like the exact same code. How does that work? Can you copyright the <i>method</i>\
      \ that you used to implement a feature? That sounds more like a patent to me.\
      \ And if you <b>can</b> copyright the method, how much code has to be copied\
      \ before it's considered stealing the source? In this example, the loading thing\
      \ is only about 5 lines of code. It hardly seems like copying, but I wouldn't\
      \ have been able to come up with it myself. What if it were a much larger chunk\
      \ of code, like the GUIHook system that Jailbreak uses? (Can you tell I've learned\
      \ a lot from Jailbreak? You guys are geniuses.)</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> No. Once\
      \ again, that's a patent which is different. However, I wrote up the necessary\
      \ bits required to do that on the wiki long ago. If you copied the code from\
      \ another mod, without permission, that might be a violation of copyright. If\
      \ you decompiled or reverse engineered their code without permission that might\
      \ also be a violation of copyright. (I say might because it will vary based\
      \ on what sort of license the mod was released under, and the laws in your particular\
      \ country.)</p>\n<p>As for it ending up looking the same.. well, that's a bit\
      \ of a tricky one. From a moral perspective I would say no. However, one has\
      \ to consider: if you read a book, then wanted to write a book on that topic,\
      \ but you wrote exactly what they wrote because you felt that was the best way\
      \ to express it: would that be copyright infringement? It would, of course,\
      \ so the same logic could probrably apply to this situation.</p>\n<p>However,\
      \ considering that I wrote up all the info you need almost a year ago on the\
      \ wiki, one could reasonably argue that the methods are public knowledge. See\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Vignette\" title=\"Legacy:Vignette\">Vignette</a>. I didn't\
      \ want to make it tutorial-like, so there isn't any \"hand holding\" per se,\
      \ but all the information you should need is pretty plainly laid out.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Being the one who made that Jailbreak JBGUIHook code, I\
      \ assure you that <a href=\"/Legacy:Vignette\" title=\"Legacy:Vignette\">Vignette</a>\
      \ has little to do with it. – OverloadUT: If, just for the sake of the argument,\
      \ the Jailbreak team didn't give you permission to use their code, copying their\
      \ code would be exactly what copyright does <i>not</i> allow you to do. The\
      \ difference between a patent and copyright is just that copyright would allow\
      \ you to re-invent the same technique on your own without copying it, while\
      \ a patent means that even if you thought it up all by yourself and perhaps\
      \ didn't even know about the patent, you still wouldn't be allowed to use it.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Err, yes. I was referring to the custom loading screens. I\
      \ don't know what the Jailbreak \"GUI hooks\" refers to.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ I'm confusing my own code here... JBGUIHook is responsible for Jailbreak's\
      \ custom menu music and the \"Add-Ons\" tab which is dynamically added to the\
      \ game setup screen. Jailbreak <i>also</i> replaces the loading screens by map-specific\
      \ custom ones, and <i>that</i> code is what I was referring to as having little\
      \ to do with the bit that's written up on <a href=\"/Legacy:Vignette\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Vignette\">Vignette</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Err. Hmm. May I look\
      \ at the code for Jailbreak to see what you have done there? I don't see how\
      \ else one could alter the loading screens without making use of the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Vignette\" title=\"Legacy:Vignette\">Vignette</a> class, but I'd be\
      \ interested to see what you have done there.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Jailbreak\
      \ integrates into the game as (yet another) game type and thus doesn't have\
      \ it's own .ini file. Thus, Jailbreak's implementation of the static GetLoadingHint\
      \ function modifies the existing <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:UT2K4ServerLoading?redlink=1\"\

      \ object (subclass of <a href=\"/Legacy:Vignette\" title=\"Legacy:Vignette\"\
      >Vignette</a>) to replace the default UT2004 loading screen rather than creating\
      \ its own <a href=\"/Legacy:Vignette\" title=\"Legacy:Vignette\">Vignette</a>\
      \ subclass and registering it in an .ini file. (I'd link you to JDN for the\
      \ code, but unfortunately it's down at the moment and I won't be able to look\
      \ into that problem until later tonight.)</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ a bunch of modders fighting over the copyright permissions. What would be\
      \ the legally correct thing to do?</p>\n<p>I'm going to try and get permission\
      \ from Hasbro to use Nerf© material in <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Nytro?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:Nytro (page does not exist)\">my mod</a>, but\
      \ I thought I would consider this a bit first.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Permission\
      \ to use somebody's copyrighted material sticks with a certain mod concept.\
      \ So if some people of that team continue working on the very same project,the\
      \ copyright holder won't even care. However, if each faction of the team starts\
      \ a new project only roughly along the lines of the old, you have to inquire\
      \ for permission individually again.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> What if the team\
      \ were to split in half, and both halves wanted to continue production from\
      \ where they were before? Where does the copyright lie in this case? Do both\
      \ parties retain copyright priviledges as they had the copyrights when they\
      \ were part of the original team? Is the copyright retained by whichever team\
      \ has the name that the copyright was originally assigned to, and thus belong\
      \ to whichever team contains the person who founded the team?</p>\n<p><b>RegularX:</b>\
      \ Most companies would have you sign a legal document that would explain exactly\
      \ how they define the party being granted the license. Quite possibly both would\
      \ lose copyright privs, have to ask the holder again (who would probably just\
      \ be annoyed and drop it at that point). Or it would be in the hands of one\
      \ principal person (the mod founder). Point is, a copyright license is a singular\
      \ entity, it doesn't duplicate due to the number of people on a team, you can't\
      \ re-divide it up after it's granted.</p>\n<p><b>GRAF!K:</b> The point is, though,\
      \ that after a team split up, everyone would claim that <i>they</i> own the\
      \ team and therefore the copyright.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> At the end of the\
      \ day it's the copyright owner's decision who gets permission to use it for\
      \ what purpose. If two factions end up bickering about permission that was previously\
      \ granted to the entire team for a certain project, chances are that the copyright\
      \ owner behaves as RegularX suggests and makes clear that the original permission\
      \ was only granted to the entire original team <i>and</i> project, not the two\
      \ halves of it. If in doubt, ask the only entity that has a say in this: the\
      \ copyright holder.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Okay, I have another question about\
      \ teams and copyright: suppose you are working on a mod/game/whatever with a\
      \ team and part of the team breaks off, including some of the coders. The code\
      \ is mostly in the tweaking stage, so most of the code has been touched in some\
      \ way by every coder. The coders on the part that has broken off then claim\
      \ that the original team cannot use the code because it is, at least partially,\
      \ their intellectual property. How does this work? Do the breakaway coders have\
      \ a valid argument, or how would that be settled?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> In\
      \ a real-life business relationship, there'd be a legal entity (the \"company\"\
      ) that owns the code, and all coders would have signed a contract that expressly\
      \ states that the code they produce for the company becomes the company's property.\
      \ If a coder (or many coders) leave the company, the code ownership sticks with\
      \ the company. It'd be a separate question who the company itself would stick\
      \ to; possibly one that'd have to be settled in a law suit.</p>\n<p>Matters\
      \ are obviously different in a mod team situation that was never formalized\
      \ in any way. Given the lack of any legally binding contract between the people\
      \ from the original mod team, they all retain ownership of their own creations;\
      \ and if part of the code has been worked on by several people, <i>none</i>\
      \ of them has the right to individually use it without the other involved coders'\
      \ permission.</p>\n<p><b>Haral:</b> The law will rarely factor into situations\
      \ like this... Especially considering how incredibly hard it would be to prove\
      \ who made what. The only real standard for a situation like that is a moral\
      \ one. A decent argument could also be made that their work was made as part\
      \ of that team, and became open for use amongst that team from the moment they\
      \ sent the code out. Kind of like posting code on a public forum.</p>\n<p>Really\
      \ though, when it comes to inner-team conflicts, the closest to law you might\
      \ get is a daytime \"Judge\" show.</p>\n<p><b>Uncommon:</b> Don't forget <a\
      \ href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Trademark\"\
      >trademarks</a>, and how that's different from copyright. People often confuse\
      \ the two. The name \"Unreal Tournament\" is a trademark, while the content\
      \ of the game is copyrighted. The characters in the game, and their names, may\
      \ also be trademarks - particularly the more recognizable ones like Malcolm\
      \ or Gorge. Copyright would apply to the actual skins and models of those chararcters.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> True, but I would expect that trademarks are fairly obvious\
      \ - I can't see a a modder who respected copyright being unaware that they would\
      \ need permission to use the term \"Quake\" as the title of their mod, or conversely\
      \ a person worrying about whether or not they need permission to call their\
      \ weapon mod, \"the BowFlex.\"</p>\n<p><b>Draconx:</b> You would have very little\
      \ success trying to enforce trademarks on a game character name called \"Malcolm\"\
      , reasonably common names like that having their trademarks enforced could end\
      \ up with someone saying something like \"You are to cease using your name where\
      \ other people can see/hear it\". But with a character name like Xan you likely\
      \ would be able to enforce your trademarks on.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> But remember,\
      \ that trademarks are only enforceable in the market to which they apply. So,\
      \ for instance, if you did have the name Malcolm trademarked for video games,\
      \ it would not invalidate a person's ability to be named Malcolm, or even another\
      \ company from naming their products Malcolm, so long as it wasn't within the\
      \ same market. So for instance a vacuum cleaner called \"Unreal\" would be perfectly\
      \ legit.</p>\n<p>However, it is probable that you couldn't trademark the name\
      \ Malcolm, but you probrably could trademark the name Malcolm used in conjunction\
      \ with the likeness of that character.</p>\n<p><b>Uncommon:</b> My point was\
      \ just to call attention to the difference between the two. People often say\
      \ copyright when they mean trademark.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU\

  wikitext:
    text: "The more popular modding becomes, the more often one sees mods based on\
      \ existing ideas:  movies, games, and so on.  However, there is one problem\
      \ inherent to all such mods:  '''Copyrights.'''\n\n==What's Copyright?==\n\n\
      Movies, games, mods, they're all copyrighted to somebody.  What does this mean?\
      \  The owner of the [[Wikipedia:copyright]] is guaranteed certain privileges\
      \ to his material.  This includes:\n\n* the exclusive right to '''reproduction''',\n\
      * the exclusive right to '''derivative works''',\n* the exclusive right to '''distribution'''\
      \ and\n* the exclusive right to '''public performance and display'''.\n\nThe\
      \ most important one, as far as mods go, is the \"exclusive right to derivative\
      \ works.\"  A derivative work is anything based on the original copyrighted\
      \ work.\n\nA simple example:  You can't make an Unreal Tournament mod for Quake\
      \ III.  The game, along with the content, is copyrighted to Epic Games.  Or...\
      \ you couldn't make an ''Independence Day'' mod (you know, the movie...).\n\n\
      ; \"But we are not making profit.\" : It doesn't matter.  The owner still retains\
      \ the right to decide what is done with their material, and they even legally\
      \ ''have to'' protect it in order not to create a precedent that may cause them\
      \ to lose it when it ''really'' hurts.  (And they still potentially lose money\
      \ due to your mod even if you don't make any.  But regardless of that, \"damage\"\
      \ is not a concept that comes in where copyright is concerned.)\n\n; \"What\
      \ about fair use?\" :  Generally, [[Wikipedia:Fair use|fair use]] is limited\
      \ to a reasonably small portion of a work.  The \"portion\" however depends\
      \ on the work itself.  Using a quote from a book on a website wouldn't constitute\
      \ copyright infringement as it's one sentence out of thousands; copying an entire\
      \ article from that website and using it is a different matter though.\n\nWhat\
      \ it comes down to is '''explicit permission.'''  If you don't have it, you\
      \ can't do it.  Some people and companies will grant it, others won't.  Nintendo,\
      \ for example, is very strict with their quality assurance and doesn't grant\
      \ permissions to mod developers.  On the other hand, I recall a mod based on\
      \ Square's ''Final Fantasy'' characters, and they had in fact gotten permission\
      \ to use them.  But you’re better off getting a letter refusing permission before\
      \ you start a mod, than getting a cease-and-desist letter six months into development.\n\
      \n==Why Does This Matter?==\n\nBesides being illegal there are several other\
      \ consequences of copyright infringement to consider before starting a mod project.\
      \ First of all, if you're reading this you're ''probably'' a coder, level designer,\
      \ 3D artist, 2D artist, or have some other talent associated with game development.\
      \ And, in the course of creating content, you will (or have) put in a huge amount\
      \ of time and effort into your project. And, in the end, the '''only''' way\
      \ of protecting your hard work from theft by others is copyright protection.\
      \ So, with that in mind, let's consider a couple of scenarios.\n\n; Scenario\
      \ A : \n\n\nYou and a group of other buddies have worked hard for over a year\
      \ to produce a terrific mod. Then another group of developers comes along, rips\
      \ off all your content, ports it over to a newer engine over the course of just\
      \ a couple of months. And then, after it's release, this new mod slowly starts\
      \ stealing away your fanbase.\n\nHow upset would you be? Wouldn't you invoke\
      \ your rights as the owner of that content and do everything in your power to\
      \ stop it?\n\n\n; Scenario B : You ''own'' the copyright to a commerical game\
      \ title that is your main source of income. You rely on that income to feed\
      \ your family, pay your employees, and buy all your shiny new toys. Then, along\
      \ comes another game that is a direct copy of your title. And, to top it all\
      \ off, this new game is a mod, available for, gasp!, ''free'' to any person\
      \ with an Internet connection. So instead of having to ''buy'' your game, gamers\
      \ can download another game that's almost the same for ''free''. \n\nNow, is\
      \ it any surprise why game companies won't hesitate to slap you with a \"cease\
      \ and desist\" order? The newer the game, the greater the danger to mods copying\
      \ that title of being stopped dead in their tracks. Obviously, this is less\
      \ of a danger to mods based on older games, but not necessarily so. You never\
      \ know when a company may be planning on, or is already developing, a sequel.\
      \ And if that's the case, you better believe they'll come after you.\n\nThis\
      \ is why the ''\"but nobody's making profit\"'' argument doesn't work. It doesn't\
      \ matter that '''you're not making profit.''' What matters is that '''they're\
      \ losing profit,''' and they may even lose their intellectual property rights\
      \ if they don't protect them.\n\n==How Does This Affect the Community?==\n\n\
      As a development community it is our collective responsibility to maintain its\
      \ health. Not only is it in our best interests to share resources and insight,\
      \ it is equally in our best interests to protect the property of its individual\
      \ members. Tolerating the theft of others property by current mod teams encourages\
      \ that behavior in fledgling teams. And who's to say it isn't ''your'' property\
      \ that's stolen next?  \n\nAnother factor to consider is the simple fact that\
      \ people with the Talents necessary to publish mods are in very short supply.\
      \ The is only a finite number of mods that can be in developement at any one\
      \ time. Now consider a mod that's assembled a team of three or four dedicated\
      \ guys that have put in hundreds of man-hours of work into their project. Then,\
      \ six months into their work, the receive the dreaded \"cease and desist\" order\
      \ from the game they're copying. All those man-hours of work are now wasted,\
      \ when they could have been used by a mod project that has a much better chance\
      \ of reaching production.\n\nProducing a mod is an ''incredibly'' difficult\
      \ thing to do, and only a miniscule percent of mods that get started ever see\
      \ the light of day. And starting a mod that's a copy of another game or movie\
      \ only adds to that difficulty and further reduces you chances of ever releasing,\
      \ since you're starting with a ''big'' strike against you. So, every developer\
      \ that joins the doomed project is one less developer that could have been used\
      \ elsewhere.\n\nThe simple fact is that starting, joining, or even tolerating,\
      \ mods that violate copyright law is detrimental to the community as a whole.\
      \ \n\n==Getting Permission==\n\nThe good news is that often the only thing necessary\
      \ to receive the coveted \"permission\" is a letter to the orginal producer\
      \ stating your intent to produce a mod based on thier work, and your reasons\
      \ for doing so. When writing this letter, there are several recommendations\
      \ to getting it noticed and receiving a positive answer.\n\nWhen obtaining permission\
      \ to use copyrighted material, get permission for an individual, not a team,\
      \ to use the material. That way, if the mod team splits up, there is no ambiguity\
      \ as to who has permission to continue use of the material.\n\n===How to Write\
      \ a Good Letter===\n\n; Snail mail vs. email : That's a judgement call, and\
      \ there's no way I can answer it. The only thing I can recommend, is to do your\
      \ research. Find as much contact info as you can. Find out ''who'' you need\
      \ to contact and what contact info this individual posts about themselves. Often\
      \ times people will have a preference, so try and find out what that is. In\
      \ either case, the rest of rules apply no matter what medium you choose.\n\n\
      ; Professionalism : Be as professional as possible. Structure it as a business\
      \ letter. Use your '''real name''', not your game nick. (Sincerely, ThunderFart\
      \ does ''not'' look good on a business proposal.) Use correct grammar, spelling,\
      \ and punctuation (see below). The quickest way to end up in the circular file\
      \ is to send a letter that looks like it was written by a 12-year-old. So, if\
      \ your ''are'' a 12-year-old, or just write like one, find a buddy to write\
      \ the letter for you. \n\n; Language : Unless the original producer is located\
      \ in a non-English speaking country ''and'' you are fluent in the language of\
      \ that country, your letter should be in English. English is the international\
      \ business language. If English is not your first language, find a buddy who\
      \ speaks english fluently to avoid mistranslations. \n\n; Use compliments &ndash;\
      \ do not brown-nose! : But, do let them know that you picked their game or movie\
      \ because you ''like'' it. It's fun and entertaining, and you want to continue\
      \ that tradition with your new mod. This is especially effective for an older\
      \ game or movie that is no longer in production.\n\n; Not for profit : While\
      \ being non-profit won't matter if you fail to ask for permission, if you do\
      \ bother to ask often this is the ''key'' to getting that permission.\n\n; Educational\
      \ : Do ''not'' say that your project is for a school project unless that is\
      \ the case. However you are more than welcome to say this project is for your\
      \ \"personal\" education. This is another factor that might soften them up a\
      \ bit.\n\n; Credit : If you're going to copy the game, then copy the game. Make\
      \ it completely obvious what game you are emulating and give the original producer\
      \ full credit for the original game.\n\n==Summary==\n\nI hope that this article\
      \ doesn't completely discourage you from making a mod from an existing game\
      \ or movie. But, I do hope it discourages you from doing one without the ''permission''\
      \ of its original owner. Copyright law is there for a reason. And before you\
      \ decide it's okay to be a thief, please think long and hard about the consequences\
      \ of your actions, and how you would feel if it was you being stolen from.\n\

      \n==Discussion==\n\n'''BM.Deathwind:'''  I do plan on revising/editing this.\
      \  So list your suggestions/questions.\n\n'''Cookie:''' Excellent Deathwind.\
      \ This article was desperately needed. I went ahead added a few more sections\
      \ that I felt elaborated on the importance of this issue. Hope you don't mind.\n\
      \n'''BM.Deathwind:''' Impressive!! :) I really like what you did...\n\n'''RegularX:'''\
      \ Nicely written.  The \"not making profit\" myth really needs to be plastered\
      \ around everywhere.  A lot of mod groups are fans of X, whether X be Jason\
      \ movies or Alien movies or Starcraft, etc., and realizing such concepts might\
      \ avoid a legal letter or two.\n\n'''OverloadUT:''' What about the topic of\
      \ the copyright of the mod being developed? I expected that to be covered here,\
      \ but it's not.  What I mean is: If I release a mod and include a license that\
      \ says \"You may not use this to make dirivative works or modify this code\"\
      \ and then someone does, do I have grounds to press charges?  I wouldn't be\
      \ surprised if you automatically give up all rights to your project because\
      \ it's released for an engine to which you do not have a license. Does anybody\
      \ know the answer to this?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' What's written here about other\
      \ people's rights to their intellectual property naturally applies to mods as\
      \ well.  I've changed the first paragraph to make that more obvious.  You actually\
      \ don't even have to include a license that states that you own the copyright\
      \ &ndash; you do, by default.\n\n'''OverloadUT:''' Okay, I've got a more tricky\
      \ situation. I'll use a real life relevant scenario: I'm making a CTF4 mod,\
      \ which adds four team support to UT2004.  This is nice because it allows anyone\
      \ to make a 4 team mod by using my gameclass as a base. But if on release I\
      \ said that no one is allowed to make a mod that uses my code as a base, does\
      \ that hold?  The difference being that I have not created anything particuarly\
      \ innovative.  \"4-team gameplay\" is probably not something I can copyright.\
      \ And if someone makes a mod that sits on top of my code without actually changing\
      \ my code or stealing any of my code, are they doing anything (legally) wrong?\
      \ Please note that this is simply a question for the sake of knowing the answer.\
      \ I don't really have an issue with someone using CTF4 as a base for another\
      \ mod.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' It not being innovative or revolutionary is irrelevant.\
      \ If you wrote a book that was essentially an age-old story rehased, you still\
      \ have copyright over it - even if it's \"nothing new.\" Whether or not it's\
      \ innovative is an issue that applies to patent law, which is not the same as\
      \ copyright.\n\nHowever: As for whether or not they are doing anything wrong\
      \ if they derive off of your classes and don't include any code: That's a bit\
      \ tricky, but I think it would be legal - after all, their code only makes reference\
      \ to your work, much like Coles notes, or a book report might make reference\
      \ to your work.\n\nHowever, it's not quite the same, since one can still read\
      \ (make use of) a book report without the book in question, while a person would\
      \ not be able to use code that referenced your code without having your (compiled)\
      \ work. In addition, one might logically argue that their package is linked\
      \ to yours at runtime by the virtual machine and thus constitutes a derivative\
      \ work, but I doubt many judges would understand what that means, so.. err,\
      \ that might not work. ;)\n\nYou could, in that case, maybe argue that the license\
      \ does not allow them to view your code, which would be required in order to\
      \ derive from the class. (Unless they claim they just \"guessed\" the function\
      \ names, etc. ;))\n\nA person might also be able to include a clause specifically\
      \ forbidding such use, (not sure how well that would stand up) and you could\
      \ certainately restrict redistribution, though then they could still link and\
      \ state that you had to download the CTF4 mod separate from theirs.\n\nHrm,\
      \ and if you did that, you could change function and variable names with each\
      \ new release, and if the license only allowed to most recent version to be\
      \ mirrored, then I SUPPOSE you could prevent such behaviour that way. Though\
      \ that's probrably not ideal.\n\nIn the end I think it would mostly come down\
      \ to your (or your lawyers') ability to convince the judge. It seems like a\
      \ person OUGHT TO have control over that sort of thing, but the challenge would\
      \ lie in explaining OOP and how it relates to what the person has done.\n\n\
      '''Foxpaw:''' Err.. doh! Just thought when I put that edit in; console manufacturers\
      \ like Nintendo have a legal ability to control what games are released for\
      \ their platform: so there is some legal background to the notion that a copyright\
      \ holder can have some control over what software is run on their platform -\
      \ you would only have to argue that your copyrighted work is being used as a\
      \ software platform for another piece of software.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' You can\
      \ keep people from creating \"derivative works\" of your code (and what's a\
      \ subclass if not, literally, a \"derivative work\"?).  However, you have no\
      \ right on the \"four teams\" idea just because you implemented it first &ndash;\
      \ that's the difference between ''copyright'' and ''patents''.  You could (probably,\
      \ sadly) ''patent'' the idea of having four teams instead of two fighting against\
      \ each other, but you cannot ''copyright'' it &ndash; just your code that implements\
      \ it.  Anybody else can come up with the same idea and legally implement it\
      \ on their own.\n\n'''OverloadUT:''' Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for the\
      \ answers! I think I was getting patents and copyrights confused.  I have another\
      \ situation to ponder though: Let's say I wanted to add custom loading screens\
      \ for my mod, based on what map is loading. To do this, I would remember that\
      \ Jailbreak did that very thing, so I would look at that code and see how they\
      \ did it.  If I implemented that code in to my mod without permission, is that\
      \ copyright violation?  What if I asked for permission and they denied it? I\
      \ mean, I've seen how the code works now, and I could \"rewrite\" the code but\
      \ since their way is the best way to do it, it might end up looking like the\
      \ exact same code. How does that work? Can you copyright the ''method'' that\
      \ you used to implement a feature? That sounds more like a patent to me. And\
      \ if you '''can''' copyright the method, how much code has to be copied before\
      \ it's considered stealing the source? In this example, the loading thing is\
      \ only about 5 lines of code. It hardly seems like copying, but I wouldn't have\
      \ been able to come up with it myself. What if it were a much larger chunk of\
      \ code, like the GUIHook system that Jailbreak uses?  (Can you tell I've learned\
      \ a lot from Jailbreak? You guys are geniuses.)\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' No. Once again,\
      \ that's a patent which is different. However, I wrote up the necessary bits\
      \ required to do that on the wiki long ago. If you copied the code from another\
      \ mod, without permission, that might be a violation of copyright. If you decompiled\
      \ or reverse engineered their code without permission that might also be a violation\
      \ of copyright. (I say might because it will vary based on what sort of license\
      \ the mod was released under, and the laws in your particular country.)\n\n\
      As for it ending up looking the same.. well, that's a bit of a tricky one. From\
      \ a moral perspective I would say no. However, one has to consider: if you read\
      \ a book, then wanted to write a book on that topic, but you wrote exactly what\
      \ they wrote because you felt that was the best way to express it: would that\
      \ be copyright infringement? It would, of course, so the same logic could probrably\
      \ apply to this situation.\n\nHowever, considering that I wrote up all the info\
      \ you need almost a year ago on the wiki, one could reasonably argue that the\
      \ methods are public knowledge. See [[Legacy:Vignette|Vignette]]. I didn't want\
      \ to make it tutorial-like, so there isn't any \"hand holding\" per se, but\
      \ all the information you should need is pretty plainly laid out.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Being the one who made that Jailbreak JBGUIHook code, I assure you that [[Legacy:Vignette|Vignette]]\
      \ has little to do with it. &ndash; OverloadUT: If, just for the sake of the\
      \ argument, the Jailbreak team didn't give you permission to use their code,\
      \ copying their code would be exactly what copyright does ''not'' allow you\
      \ to do.  The difference between a patent and copyright is just that copyright\
      \ would allow you to re-invent the same technique on your own without copying\
      \ it, while a patent means that even if you thought it up all by yourself and\
      \ perhaps didn't even know about the patent, you still wouldn't be allowed to\
      \ use it.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Err, yes. I was referring to the custom loading screens.\
      \ I don't know what the Jailbreak \"GUI hooks\" refers to.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ I'm confusing my own code here...  JBGUIHook is responsible for Jailbreak's\
      \ custom menu music and the \"Add-Ons\" tab which is dynamically added to the\
      \ game setup screen.  Jailbreak ''also'' replaces the loading screens by map-specific\
      \ custom ones, and ''that'' code is what I was referring to as having little\
      \ to do with the bit that's written up on [[Legacy:Vignette|Vignette]].\n\n\
      '''Foxpaw:''' Err. Hmm. May I look at the code for Jailbreak to see what you\
      \ have done there? I don't see how else one could alter the loading screens\
      \ without making use of the [[Legacy:Vignette|Vignette]] class, but I'd be interested\
      \ to see what you have done there.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Jailbreak integrates into\
      \ the game as (yet another) game type and thus doesn't have it's own .ini file.\
      \  Thus, Jailbreak's implementation of the static GetLoadingHint function modifies\
      \ the existing [[Legacy:UT2K4ServerLoading|UT2K4ServerLoading]] object (subclass\
      \ of [[Legacy:Vignette|Vignette]]) to replace the default UT2004 loading screen\
      \ rather than creating its own [[Legacy:Vignette|Vignette]] subclass and registering\
      \ it in an .ini file.  (I'd link you to JDN for the code, but unfortunately\
      \ it's down at the moment and I won't be able to look into that problem until\
      \ later tonight.)\n\n===Teams and Copyright Permission===\n\n'''GRAF!K:''' What\
      \ would happen if a mod team got permission to use copyrighted material, then\
      \ broke up? Then you would have a bunch of modders fighting over the copyright\
      \ permissions. What would be the legally correct thing to do?\n\nI'm going to\
      \ try and get permission from Hasbro to use Nerf&copy; material in [[Legacy:Nytro|my\
      \ mod]], but I thought I would consider this a bit first.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ Permission to use somebody's copyrighted material sticks with a certain mod\
      \ concept.  So if some people of that team continue working on the very same\
      \ project,the copyright holder won't even care.  However, if each faction of\
      \ the team starts a new project only roughly along the lines of the old, you\
      \ have to inquire for permission individually again.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' What if\
      \ the team were to split in half, and both halves wanted to continue production\
      \ from where they were before? Where does the copyright lie in this case? Do\
      \ both parties retain copyright priviledges as they had the copyrights when\
      \ they were part of the original team? Is the copyright retained by whichever\
      \ team has the name that the copyright was originally assigned to, and thus\
      \ belong to whichever team contains the person who founded the team?\n\n'''RegularX:'''\
      \ Most companies would have you sign a legal document that would explain exactly\
      \ how they define the party being granted the license.  Quite possibly both\
      \ would lose copyright privs, have to ask the holder again (who would probably\
      \ just be annoyed and drop it at that point). Or it would be in the hands of\
      \ one principal person (the mod founder).  Point is, a copyright license is\
      \ a singular entity, it doesn't duplicate due to the number of people on a team,\
      \ you can't re-divide it up after it's granted.\n\n'''GRAF!K:''' The point is,\
      \ though, that after a team split up, everyone would claim that ''they'' own\
      \ the team and therefore the copyright.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' At the end of the\
      \ day it's the copyright owner's decision who gets permission to use it for\
      \ what purpose.  If two factions end up bickering about permission that was\
      \ previously granted to the entire team for a certain project, chances are that\
      \ the copyright owner behaves as RegularX suggests and makes clear that the\
      \ original permission was only granted to the entire original team ''and'' project,\
      \ not the two halves of it.  If in doubt, ask the only entity that has a say\
      \ in this: the copyright holder.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Okay, I have another question\
      \ about teams and copyright: suppose you are working on a mod/game/whatever\
      \ with a team and part of the team breaks off, including some of the coders.\
      \ The code is mostly in the tweaking stage, so most of the code has been touched\
      \ in some way by every coder. The coders on the part that has broken off then\
      \ claim that the original team cannot use the code because it is, at least partially,\
      \ their intellectual property. How does this work? Do the breakaway coders have\
      \ a valid argument, or how would that be settled?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' In a real-life\
      \ business relationship, there'd be a legal entity (the \"company\") that owns\
      \ the code, and all coders would have signed a contract that expressly states\
      \ that the code they produce for the company becomes the company's property.\
      \  If a coder (or many coders) leave the company, the code ownership sticks\
      \ with the company.  It'd be a separate question who the company itself would\
      \ stick to; possibly one that'd have to be settled in a law suit.\n\nMatters\
      \ are obviously different in a mod team situation that was never formalized\
      \ in any way.  Given the lack of any legally binding contract between the people\
      \ from the original mod team, they all retain ownership of their own creations;\
      \ and if part of the code has been worked on by several people, ''none'' of\
      \ them has the right to individually use it without the other involved coders'\
      \ permission.\n\n'''Haral:''' The law will rarely factor into situations like\
      \ this... Especially considering how incredibly hard it would be to prove who\
      \ made what.  The only real standard for a situation like that is a moral one.\
      \  A decent argument could also be made that their work was made as part of\
      \ that team, and became open for use amongst that team from the moment they\
      \ sent the code out.  Kind of like posting code on a public forum.\n\nReally\
      \ though, when it comes to inner-team conflicts, the closest to law you might\
      \ get is a daytime \"Judge\" show.\n\n'''Uncommon:''' Don't forget [[Wikipedia:Trademark|trademarks]],\
      \ and how that's different from copyright. People often confuse the two. The\
      \ name \"Unreal Tournament\" is a trademark, while the content of the game is\
      \ copyrighted. The characters in the game, and their names, may also be trademarks\
      \ - particularly the more recognizable ones like Malcolm or Gorge. Copyright\
      \ would apply to the actual skins and models of those chararcters.\n\n'''Foxpaw:'''\
      \ True, but I would expect that trademarks are fairly obvious - I can't see\
      \ a a modder who respected copyright being unaware that they would need permission\
      \ to use the term \"Quake\" as the title of their mod, or conversely a person\
      \ worrying about whether or not they need permission to call their weapon mod,\
      \ \"the BowFlex.\"\n\n'''Draconx:''' You would have very little success trying\
      \ to enforce trademarks on a game character name called \"Malcolm\", reasonably\
      \ common names like that having their trademarks enforced could end up with\
      \ someone saying something like \"You are to cease using your name where other\
      \ people can see/hear it\".  But with a character name like Xan you likely would\
      \ be able to enforce your trademarks on.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' But remember, that\
      \ trademarks are only enforceable in the market to which they apply. So, for\
      \ instance, if you did have the name Malcolm trademarked for video games, it\
      \ would not invalidate a person's ability to be named Malcolm, or even another\
      \ company from naming their products Malcolm, so long as it wasn't within the\
      \ same market. So for instance a vacuum cleaner called \"Unreal\" would be perfectly\
      \ legit.\n\nHowever, it is probable that you couldn't trademark the name Malcolm,\
      \ but you probrably could trademark the name Malcolm used in conjunction with\
      \ the likeness of that character.\n\n'''Uncommon:''' My point was just to call\
      \ attention to the difference between the two. People often say copyright when\
      \ they mean trademark."
