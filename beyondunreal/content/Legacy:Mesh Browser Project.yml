      \ a database of all the default Texture and Static Mesh packages in Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2004. It has keywords assigned to each mesh or texture, and has a search function.\
      \ If you're looking for a static mesh to use as a pipe, you type in 'pipe' in\
      \ the keyword browser, and it lists all the mesh names (and locations) that\
      \ fit that description. You can add more than one keyword to further filter\
      \ the results ('pipe' would return a LOT of meshes). If you're looking for a\
      \ \"rusty\" texture, you do the same thing and see what the browser returns,\
      \ etc. It supports thumbnail images, so you can scroll through and see a snapshot\
      \ of the mesh.</p>\n<p>Merely having thumbnails of each static mesh or texture\
      \ puts this light years ahead of loading packages in UED just to look through\
      \ them. With the ability to search by keyword, imagine how much time this saves.\
      \ In my own experience, I don't even bother getting very specific with my searches...if\
      \ I'm looking for a ramp, I'll put that into the browser and scroll through\
      \ the thumbnails to find something I'd like to take a closer look at in UnrealEd.\
      \ In the spirit of creativity, those working on keywording the meshes are trying\
      \ to offer suggested uses for a mesh, beyond what the meshes were originally\
      \ made for. The object is to think of what a specific mesh <b>might</b> be used\
      \ for, not just identifying it. This might result in getting a lot of results\
      \ for a particular keyword, but more is better in this case&#160;:P</p>\n<div\

      \ through the available keywords, or type the word you want to search for.\n\
      <ol>\n<li>Like Ued's broswers, it begins to parse results as you type.</li>\n\
      <li>Double-click the keyword you want, or use the arrows, and a list will be\
      \ shown of all meshes that fit that description. You can add more keywords to\
      \ narrow your search, or just click through the results. This particular example\
      \ (with an incomplete database) tells me that there are 5 different packages\
      \ that have a barrel static mesh in them.</li>\n<li>With \"Show Images\" selected,\
      \ you'll see a thumbnail of the mesh, as well as where to find it.</li>\n<li>Note\
      \ in the above example, I have already selected the keyword \"barrel\", and\
      \ the keyword list is showing me the keywords also associated with meshes that\
      \ have the \"barrel\" keyword attached...if I wanted to add \"corroded\" to\
      \ the search, it's going to narrow the list to only meshes that have both keywords.</li>\n\
      </ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can edit keywords yourself, or add packages and\
      \ keywords for meshes that come with other maps. You can share your own database\
      \ and merge someone else's database into yours quite easily. Even after there's\
      \ a single databse posted, it is expected that users will modify or edit it,\
      \ refine keywords, etc. and then share with others. It's a pretty powerful tool,\
      \ and very flexible for the future.</p>\n<p>see <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
