      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Well, I definitely grok the replication system now[though\
      \ sometimes the behavior/process confuses me], though weighting different strategies\
      \ will take time. I disagree with some of the advice given on writing with replication/netplay\
      \ in mind first–specifically as it applies to new people. Getting the code functioning\
      \ reasonably without worrying too much about replication is much much easier\
      \ for a beginner than to try and code with replication in mind–if you dont mind\
      \ refactoring. If you already understand the UnrealEngine, then by all means\
      \ consider replication from the beginning. But if you dont, I would think you\
      \ should basically look at getting the first few iterations done as a demo/rapid\
      \ prototype, and then, after you have a better handle on the architecture and\
      \ different variables involved, move on to incorporating the issue of replication\
      \ into your design and rewriting or refactoring your prototype.</p>\n<p>I love\
      \ it when I overlook simple things and realize it before going too far down\
      \ the wrong path–I did research on the bot classes but didnt start coding. Wasted\
      \ research time on a new package/area isn't really wasted. Didn't connect the\
      \ native path problem with the tellbothowtodisable hook. should have, but didnt\
      \ until i started looking at commenting on the bot wiki and it hit me that i\
      \ was overlooking the simple hook solution that epic put there. saves me a lot\
      \ of time/work. makes me wonder though why VCTF released new maps. kinda thinking\
      \ it might be possibly to do with an existing map at runtime. anyway hooray\
      \ for wiki. of course, now i have to move into new code areas that i reaaaly\
      \ dont know anything about: HUDs and that maplist issue. blah.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ note that you don't need to insert hard line breaks&#160;:) )</p>\n<p><b>Recondite:</b>\
      \ Heh, the IE off-the-end bug bit me and i was too lazy to figure it out.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> Oh I didn't know it was an IE bug that caused that. /me never\
      \ uses it&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>Daid303:</b> There is a 'bUseCylinderCollision'\
      \ in Actor, that might fix your problem?</p>\n<p><b>Recondite:</b> Lol, just\
      \ when i was coming here to update. Thanks, though, it's a little cleaner than\
      \ what i had. I'd originally used a static mesh with no collision saved (maybe\
      \ a point). It wouldnt call touch unless i was on top of it, but it would use\
      \ my actor's collision for the untouch (wierd). So i created a mesh with collision,\
      \ and that made the touch work correctly, but only if i also set the collision\
      \ height/radius in the actor, in other words bUseCollisionStaticMesh just wasnt\
      \ working like i expected. Maybe it means use the collision map and scale it\
      \ to the actor? dunno. anyway setting collision parameters in two different\
      \ places is ultra hokie. So i'm using your method&#160;:) I _would_ like to\
      \ just use the mesh collision, since it's more OO and since the two need to\
      \ line up anyway, but oh well. Thanks!</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> If you're looking\
      \ for a way to display all the maps in the map browser, you can set the prefix\
      \ to \"\". This will display all maps. It will, however, display some maps you\
      \ might not want it to, like the NVidia logo map, the Entry level, etc.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Recondite</b> I tried that, but it completely removed my gametype from\
      \ the list when i started up&#160;:/ ...unless there's another execution path\
      \ for setting it in prop files vs the default in the code. of course i admittedly\
      \ dont understand the map list classes–do you have to have a custom subclass\
      \ of maplist? thanks</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I don't know if you need a custom\
      \ subclass or not, but you probrably do. I'm guessing that since all the other\
      \ gametypes do even though they are just blank objects.</p>\n<p><b>Recondite</b>\
      \ blah, oddly enough, putting the class in makes it generate the full map list\
      \ in the ini. unfortunately though, it doesnt show my game type in the host/instant\
      \ action page because it thinks there are no maps(?!). Sounds like the GUI part\
      \ wont work&#160;:/ I'll try and poke around a bit later.</p>\n<p><b>Recondite</b>\
      \ well, i can get it to work in ut2vote, somewhat, it requires different entries\
      \ for the different map types (which is fine) BUT it also requires a different\
      \ gametype round between the two.&#160;:/</p>\n<p><b>Recondite</b> well...everything\
      \ else is working...i've put it off till last...and now...i have to fix the\
      \ HUD. but first, it's time for beer. If anyone's at all interested, the download\
      \ link is current. Note the ONS version is currently un-fun, needs vehicle tweaking\
      \ or teleporters. But i really enjoy DM version and CTF. Odd though, because\
      \ in Halo it was the vehicle maps that were the best. The download is only 34KB...but\
      \ dont export the source...it's suspicious lookin at this point.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ See <a href=\"/Legacy:Testing_Lab\" title=\"Legacy:Testing Lab\">Testing Lab</a>&#160;:)\
      \ Btw, you can post a game url with the protocol part and it should appear clickable.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Recondite</b> Head meet wall. Blah, so i've got the damn-skippy shoulder\
      \ weapon mutator working in non-replicated fashion [heh]. And it worked fully\
      \ until I moved it to my personal class directory and tweaked a couple variables–\
      wish i had a local source control system installed. Anyway, after screwing around\
      \ with overrides, i figured it would be easier and cleaner(!) to just toggle\
      \ the firing and set the timer appropriately. So i ripped it out and started\
      \ over...seemed simple enough. but nooo...damn replication variables...which\
      \ one am i missing? hmmm???? the weapon APPEARS on the client, perched right\
      \ on the pawns shoulder, but doesnt ever have any methods called. arg. eventually\
      \ i'll add an interaction instead of a mutate command–i have to if i want to\
      \ fire two weapons at once and don't want the weapon to actually switch...and\
      \ dont want to replace pawn or the hud...etc etc...and want to have a hud display\
      \ for the second weapon as well as the pawns weapon. but that's waaay ahead\
      \ of myself since im supposed to be working on EE.</p>\n<p>If you're really\
      \ bored and want to learn how many degrees it takes to be successfully unemployed,\
      \ then read on:</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Resume\">Resume</span><span\

      \ sometimes the behavior/process confuses me], though weighting different strategies\
      \ will take time. I disagree with some of the advice given on writing with replication/netplay\
      \ in mind first&ndash;specifically as it applies to new people. Getting the\
      \ code functioning reasonably without worrying too much about replication is\
      \ much much easier for a beginner than to try and code with replication in mind&ndash;if\
      \ you dont mind refactoring. If you already understand the UnrealEngine, then\
      \ by all means consider replication from the beginning. But if you dont, I would\
      \ think you should basically look at getting the first few iterations done as\
      \ a demo/rapid prototype, and then, after you have a better handle on the architecture\
      \ and different variables involved, move on to incorporating the issue of replication\
      \ into your design and rewriting or refactoring your prototype.\n\nI love it\
      \ when I overlook simple things and realize it before going too far down the\
      \ wrong path&ndash;I did research on the bot classes but didnt start coding.\
      \ Wasted research time on a new package/area isn't really wasted. Didn't connect\
      \ the native path problem with the tellbothowtodisable hook. should have, but\
      \ didnt until i started looking at commenting on the bot wiki and it hit me\
      \ that i was overlooking the simple hook solution that epic put there. saves\
      \ me a lot of time/work. makes me wonder though why VCTF released new maps.\
      \ kinda thinking it might be possibly to do with an existing map at runtime.\
      \ anyway hooray for wiki. of course, now i have to move into new code areas\
      \ that i reaaaly dont know anything about: HUDs and that maplist issue. blah.\n\
      \n===Texturing/Modeling===\n\nOn hold. I've read a bunch of books, but not really\
      \ done anything since i never took an art class and the tool i was using (TrueSpace)\
      \ was a pain. Plus the tools seem a little to new and too much like work. Can't\
      \ wait to see kids using 3dsmax instead of crayons ;)\n\nI am doing a little\
      \ bit here and there, had the 3dstudio max trial but need to install gmax. \
      \ and need to reinstall my old copy of truespace which has some textures i could\
      \ use.\n\n===Comments===\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Hi, welcome to Unreal Wiki! (BTW,\
      \ note that you don't need to insert hard line breaks :) )\n\n'''Recondite:'''\
      \ Heh, the IE off-the-end bug bit me and i was too lazy to figure it out.\n\n\
      '''Tarquin:''' Oh I didn't know it was an IE bug that caused that. /me never\
      \ uses it :D\n\n'''Daid303:''' There is a 'bUseCylinderCollision' in Actor,\
      \ that might fix your problem?\n\n'''Recondite:''' Lol, just when i was coming\
      \ here to update. Thanks, though, it's a little cleaner than what i had.  I'd\
      \ originally used a static mesh with no collision saved (maybe a point). It\
      \ wouldnt call touch unless i was on top of it, but it would use my actor's\
      \ collision for the untouch (wierd). So i created a mesh with collision, and\
      \ that made the touch work correctly, but only if i also set the collision height/radius\
      \ in the actor, in other words bUseCollisionStaticMesh just wasnt working like\
      \ i expected. Maybe it means use the collision map and scale it to the actor?\
      \ dunno.  anyway setting collision parameters in two different places is ultra\
      \ hokie. So i'm using your method :)  I _would_ like to just use the mesh collision,\
      \ since it's more OO and since the two need to line up anyway, but oh well.\
      \ Thanks!\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' If you're looking for a way to display all the maps\
      \ in the map browser, you can set the prefix to \"\". This will display all\
      \ maps. It will, however, display some maps you might not want it to, like the\
      \ NVidia logo map, the Entry level, etc.\n\n'''Recondite''' I tried that, but\
      \ it completely removed my gametype from the list when i started up :/ ...unless\
      \ there's another execution path for setting it in prop files vs the default\
      \ in the code. of course i admittedly dont understand the map list classes&ndash;do\
      \ you have to have a custom subclass of maplist? thanks\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I don't\
      \ know if you need a custom subclass or not, but you probrably do. I'm guessing\
      \ that since all the other gametypes do even though they are just blank objects.\n\
      \n'''Recondite''' blah, oddly enough, putting the class in makes it generate\
      \ the full map list in the ini. unfortunately though, it doesnt show my game\
      \ type in the host/instant action page because it thinks there are no maps(?!).\
      \ Sounds like the GUI part wont work :/   I'll try and poke around a bit later.\n\
      \n'''Recondite''' well, i can get it to work in ut2vote, somewhat, it requires\
      \ different entries for the different map types (which is fine) BUT it also\
      \ requires a different gametype round between the two. :/\n\n'''Recondite'''\
      \ well...everything else is working...i've put it off till last...and now...i\
      \ have to fix the HUD. but first, it's time for beer.  If anyone's at all interested,\
      \ the download link is current. Note the ONS version is currently un-fun, needs\
      \ vehicle tweaking or teleporters. But i really enjoy DM version and CTF. Odd\
      \ though, because in Halo it was the vehicle maps that were the best. The download\
      \ is only 34KB...but dont export the source...it's suspicious lookin at this\
      \ point.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' See [[Legacy:Testing Lab|Testing Lab]] :) Btw, you\
      \ can post a game url with the protocol part and it should appear clickable.\n\
      \n'''Recondite''' Head meet wall. Blah, so i've got the damn-skippy shoulder\
      \ weapon mutator working in non-replicated fashion [heh].  And it worked fully\
      \ until I moved it to my personal class directory and tweaked a couple variables&ndash;wish\
      \ i had a local source control system installed. Anyway, after screwing around\
      \ with overrides, i figured it would be easier and cleaner(!) to just toggle\
      \ the firing and set the timer appropriately. So i ripped it out and started\
      \ over...seemed simple enough. but nooo...damn replication variables...which\
      \ one am i missing? hmmm???? the weapon APPEARS on the client, perched right\
      \ on the pawns shoulder, but doesnt ever have any methods called.  arg. eventually\
      \ i'll add an interaction instead of a mutate command&ndash;i have to if i want\
      \ to fire two weapons at once and don't want the weapon to actually switch...and\
      \ dont want to replace pawn or the hud...etc etc...and want to have a hud display\
      \ for the second weapon as well as the pawns weapon. but that's waaay ahead\
      \ of myself since im supposed to be working on EE.\n\nIf you're really bored\
