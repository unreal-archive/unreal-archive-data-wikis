      <p>We first must choose a <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static\

      /Legacy:Create_A_Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Create A Static Mesh\">create\
      \ a static mesh</a> or select an existing one. For the purposes of this short\
      \ tutorial, select a <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh\"\
      >static mesh</a> that already exists. A good candidate is in the <b>HumanoidHardware</b>\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh_Package\" title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh Package\"\
      >static mesh package</a>, under the <b>Miscellaneous</b> category: <i><b>MGrate04HA</b></i></p>\n\

      <p>Once you have this static mesh selected in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Static_Mesh_Browser\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh Browser\">static mesh browser</a>, click the <i>Add\
      \ Mover Brush</i> button in the UnrealEd <a href=\"/Legacy:Toolbox\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Toolbox\">toolbox</a> (this button has a picture of a blue box with several\
      \ arrows coming out of it). The static mesh you selected should appear in your\

      <p>Move the lift to the location where you want it to start from. We now must\
      \ introduce the concept of <a href=\"/Legacy:Keyframe\" title=\"Legacy:Keyframe\"\
      >keyframes</a>. A mover can have a total of 8 <a href=\"/Legacy:Keyframe\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Keyframe\">keyframes</a>. Think of these as navigation points which the\
      \ mover will travel along. Our lift will begin at frame 0, travel to frame 1,\
      \ then frame 2, etc. Normally, lifts only have 2 <a href=\"/Legacy:Keyframe\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Keyframe\">keyframes</a>, so we will only use two for this\
      \ example.</p>\n<p>Right click on the static mesh, select the <i>Mover</i> submenu\
      \ and select the <b>Key 1</b> menu item. We have just told UnrealEd to note\
      \ where keyframe 1 is located. Now move your lift to its destination location.\
      \ This new position is where keyframe 1 is located. If you right click the static\
      \ mesh again, select the <i>Mover</i> submenu and select the <b>Key 0</b> menu\
      \ item, you will note that the lift returns to its starting position! Once you\
      \ have returned the lift to its starting position, it is time to begin editing\
      \ the lift properties.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Setting_Lift_Properties\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Again, right click the static mesh we are using for\
      \ our lift, and select the <b>Mover Properties</b> menu item. The properties\
      \ window will appear. First, expand the <b>Object</b> category. We should change\
      \ the <i>InitialState</i> variable from a value of <i>BumpOpenTimed</i> to <i>StandOpenTimed</i>.\
      \ This will prevent the lift from rising up the instant the player touches it\
      \ (which could cause the lift to leave without the player).</p>\n<p>Next, expand\
      \ the <b>Mover</b> category. There are many different settings available here,\
      \ but we are primarily focused on just a few. First is the <i>MoverEncroachType</i>\
      \ variable. The two most interesting values here are <i>ME_ReturnWhenEncroach</i>\
      \ and <i>ME_CrushWhenEncroach</i>. The first value will cause the lift to return\
      \ to the previous keyframe if it collides with an actor (e.g., a player is underneath\
      \ the lift as it comes down). The latter value will cause the player to be crushed\
      \ if they are caught underneath the lift (or they hit their head on something\
      \ on the way up). Let us leave it at <i>ME_ReturnWhenEncroach</i> for now.</p>\n\
      <p>Two other important settings are <i>MoveTime</i> and <i>StayOpenTime</i>.\
      \ These values are how long (in seconds) the lift takes to move from the first\
      \ keyframe to the last one, and how long the lift waits before returning in\
      \ the opposite direction, respectively.</p>\n<p>If you have more than two keyframes,\
      \ you <b>must</b> change the <i>NumKeys</i> variable from 2 (the default) to\
      \ however many keyframes your lift has. So, if my lift has 5 keyframes, I give\
      \ this variable a value of 5.</p>\n<p>For lifts that use triggers see <a href=\"\

      \ you do this. Expand the <b>Events</b> category and note the <i>Tag</i> variable.\
      \ By default, movers have a <i>Tag</i> value set to <i>Mover</i>. You need to\
      \ change this to something unique. I commonly use the same value as the <i>Name</i>\
      \ variable in the <b>Object</b> category. Doing this will prevent a few annoying\

      <p>Finally, let us add some sounds to our lift. Expand the <b>MoverSounds</b>\
      \ category. Listed here are several variables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>ClosedSound</b>:\
      \ This sound is played when the lift arrives at its last KeyFrame.</li>\n<li><b>ClosingSound</b>:\

      <li><b>OpenedSound</b>: This sound is played when the lift arrives at its first\
      \ KeyFrame.</li>\n<li><b>OpeningSound</b>: This sound is played when the lift\
      \ starts its first KeyFrame.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For our simple example, we only\
      \ care about <b>ClosingSound</b> and <b>OpeningSound</b>. Select an appropriate\

    text: "(This tutorial was written using [[Legacy:UnrealEd 3|UnrealEd 3]]. Prior\
      \ versions may follow a slightly different path than what is presented here.)\n\
      \nCreating a lift is a fairly simple process, once you learn how to create movers.\
      \ Let's take a look at this process in detail:\n\n==Selecting the Lift==\n\n\
      We first must choose a [[Legacy:Static Mesh|static mesh]] that will act as our\
      \ lift. You can either [[Legacy:Create A Static Mesh|create a static mesh]]\
      \ or select an existing one. For the purposes of this short tutorial, select\
      \ a [[Legacy:Static Mesh|static mesh]] that already exists. A good candidate\
      \ is in the '''HumanoidHardware''' [[Legacy:Static Mesh Package|static mesh\
      \ package]], under the '''Miscellaneous''' category: '''''MGrate04HA'''''\n\n\
      ==Adding the Lift==\n\nOnce you have this static mesh selected in the [[Legacy:Static\
      \ Mesh Browser|static mesh browser]], click the ''Add Mover Brush'' button in\
      \ the UnrealEd [[Legacy:Toolbox|toolbox]] (this button has a picture of a blue\
      \ box with several arrows coming out of it). The static mesh you selected should\
      \ appear in your map and should show up as a purple color (pink if it is selected).\n\
      \n==Placing the Lift==\n\nMove the lift to the location where you want it to\
      \ start from. We now must introduce the concept of [[Legacy:Keyframe|keyframes]].\
      \ A mover can have a total of 8 [[Legacy:Keyframe|keyframes]]. Think of these\
      \ as navigation points which the mover will travel along. Our lift will begin\
      \ at frame 0, travel to frame 1, then frame 2, etc. Normally, lifts only have\
      \ 2 [[Legacy:Keyframe|keyframes]], so we will only use two for this example.\n\
      \nRight click on the static mesh, select the ''Mover'' submenu and select the\
      \ '''Key 1''' menu item. We have just told UnrealEd to note where keyframe 1\
      \ is located. Now move your lift to its destination location. This new position\
      \ is where keyframe 1 is located. If you right click the static mesh again,\
      \ select the ''Mover'' submenu and select the '''Key 0''' menu item, you will\
      \ note that the lift returns to its starting position! Once you have returned\
      \ the lift to its starting position, it is time to begin editing the lift properties.\n\
      \n==Setting Lift Properties==\n\nAgain, right click the static mesh we are using\
      \ for our lift, and select the '''Mover Properties''' menu item. The properties\
      \ window will appear. First, expand the '''Object''' category. We should change\
      \ the ''InitialState'' variable from a value of ''BumpOpenTimed'' to ''StandOpenTimed''.\
      \ This will prevent the lift from rising up the instant the player touches it\
      \ (which could cause the lift to leave without the player).\n\nNext, expand\
      \ the '''Mover''' category. There are many different settings available here,\
      \ but we are primarily focused on just a few. First is the ''MoverEncroachType''\
      \ variable. The two most interesting values here are ''ME_ReturnWhenEncroach''\
      \ and ''ME_CrushWhenEncroach''. The first value will cause the lift to return\
      \ to the previous keyframe if it collides with an actor (e.g., a player is underneath\
      \ the lift as it comes down). The latter value will cause the player to be crushed\
      \ if they are caught underneath the lift (or they hit their head on something\
      \ on the way up). Let us leave it at ''ME_ReturnWhenEncroach'' for now.\n\n\
      Two other important settings are ''MoveTime'' and ''StayOpenTime''. These values\
      \ are how long (in seconds) the lift takes to move from the first keyframe to\
      \ the last one, and how long the lift waits before returning in the opposite\
      \ direction, respectively.\n\nIf you have more than two keyframes, you '''must'''\
      \ change the ''NumKeys'' variable from 2 (the default) to however many keyframes\
      \ your lift has. So, if my lift has 5 keyframes, I give this variable a value\
      \ of 5.\n\nFor lifts that use triggers see [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Triggered\
      \ Lifts]]\n\n==Setting the Unique Tag==\n\nThis is an incredibly important step,\
      \ so make sure you do this. Expand the '''Events''' category and note the ''Tag''\
      \ variable. By default, movers have a ''Tag'' value set to ''Mover''. You need\
      \ to change this to something unique. I commonly use the same value as the ''Name''\
      \ variable in the '''Object''' category. Doing this will prevent a few annoying\
      \ bugs (such as the ME_ReturnWhenEncroach failing to work when more than one\
      \ lift is in your level).\n\n==Adding Sound==\n\nFinally, let us add some sounds\
      \ to our lift. Expand the '''MoverSounds''' category. Listed here are several\
      \ variables:\n*'''ClosedSound''': This sound is played when the lift arrives\
      \ at its last KeyFrame.\n*'''ClosingSound''': This sound is played when the\
      \ lift starts moving towards its last KeyFrame.\n*'''LoopSound''': If the lift's\
      \ InitialState is set to ConstantLoop, then it will play this sound when it\
      \ reaches its first and last KeyFrame.\n*'''OpenedSound''': This sound is played\
      \ when the lift arrives at its first KeyFrame.\n*'''OpeningSound''': This sound\
      \ is played when the lift starts its first KeyFrame.\n\nFor our simple example,\
      \ we only care about '''ClosingSound''' and '''OpeningSound'''. Select an appropriate\
      \ sound for both. I usually use the '''door1''' sound, which can be found in\
      \ the IndoorAmbience sound package.\n\n==Conclusion==\n\nSave your map, build\
      \ all and test it out! Your lift should move from one position to the other,\
      \ include sound and do the right thing if it hits you on the head! That wasn't\
      \ so hard, was it?\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:How To Make Elevators With\
