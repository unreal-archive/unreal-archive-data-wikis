      <p>If you must scale an already placed brush, perform a \"\"Polygons-&gt;To\

      <p>Never scale too much, too fast (i.e. zooming way out in the viewport and\
      \ shooting the mouse down-screen) or it will bug out, neglect the grid, and\
      \ maybe even start blipping in the opposite direction. If this happens, its\

      \ it will scale. A standard 256 cubed cube will not scale much below 16 units,\
      \ because it is function upon the original values. To scale smaller, scale down,\
      \ make sure it is still sitting on the grid, apply transformation so it takes\
      \ on the new values, and continue to scale.</p>\n<p>The brush scales away from\
      \ the selected vertex, so selecting the center vertex and scaling it in all\
      \ directions in atleast 2 of the 2d viewports will ensure that all the vertices\
      \ of a cube are on the grid. Get used to checking all the possible vertices\
      \ of a cube, and making sure you have scaled all polygon-relevant vertices onto\
      \ the grid before you place the brush.</p>\n<p>It is best to scale from a 2d\
      \ viewport, and to select vertices from the 3d viewport.</p>\n<p>The mode is\
      \ known as \"BrushSnap\" in Ued2, rather than \"BrushScale\", because it scales\
      \ according to the grid. BrushScale ignores the grid, and should be avoided.</p>\n\
      <p>Scaling complex brushes will have unintended consequences, such as stairs\
      \ being to large to step on, or polygons stretching larger the farther they\
      \ are from the selected vertex (an effect easily of notice in a \"hollowed\"\
      \ brush). Scaling works best with symetrical shapes, such as cubes or cylinders.</p>\n\
      <p>While in BrushSnap mode, vertices cannot be selected in the 3d viewport,\
      \ so one has to switch to camera mode to do this. It is best to bind keys for\
      \ switching between camera mode and scaling mode, as well as applying transformation,\
      \ because a mapper who frequently uses this tool will have to switch between\
      \ these so often.</p>\n<p>If you need to scale something in a diagonal direction,\
      \ turn it along the y or x axis first, scale it, and then rotate it back. Otherwise,\
