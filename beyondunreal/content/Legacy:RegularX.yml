      \ me:</i> I've had several emails and AIMs which I haven't responded to...there's\
      \ like two reasons for this - I was too busy when I got it the first time (I\
      \ do, oddly, work for living) or I never knew I got it.</p>\n<p><i>UPDATE:</i>\
      \ inkless@inkless.com is an abandoned email now. I've occasionally gotten some\
      \ emails since I put up the auto-responder on it like this one: \"Hey man, chill,\
      \ my yahoo account doesn\\'t have a spamming system:) By the way, if you fear\
      \ revealing your own address, why do you ask for mine? Heh. Anyways, I have\
      \ no idea how you got spam from me. .... I never emailed you, nor received an\
      \ email from you.\"</p>\n<p>Look, it's an auto-responder. That means it automatically\
      \ responds. That means it got an email and it responded to it. If you didn't\
      \ intend to send me an email, that means you have a virus or someone you know\
      \ has a virus. It's really that simple. Before anyone goes \"but...\", no. There\
      \ is no but. That's what's going on.</p>\n<p>Now, I apologize if you get caught\
      \ up in all this mess, virus or no - but there's nothing I can do about it.\
      \ And I can't put my email address here or on that auto-response. As that email\
      \ smugly states \"By the way, if you fear revealing your own address, why do\
      \ you ask for mine? Heh.\"</p>\n<p>Well, I'll tell you. There's this thing called\
      \ email harvesting. Spammers spider virtually every piece of text they can get\
      \ their hands on and look for email formats, and then they add that to their\
      \ list. So now I have a level of anonmynity when it comes to my email address,\
      \ and I try be sure you aren't some soulless evil bastard before I give it out.\
      \ Why do I ask for yours? I don't actually, but obviously it's required in order\
      \ to get a response (which this guy didn't want, which makes you wonder why\
      \ he bothered emailing at all).</p>\n<p>In short, use the contact form link\
      \ above. Spammers are the laziest form of parasites and I know they won't bother\
      \ with it. If you (or some program in your name) sends an email to inkless@inkless.com,\
      \ it will get this <a href=\"/Legacy:RegularX/Spam_Response\" title=\"Legacy:RegularX/Spam\
      \ Response\">RegularX/Spam_Response</a>.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ been involved in game modding since Doom, but that was mostly just mapping\
      \ and the like. My first foray into UT for coding turned out to be <a rel=\"\
      nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://inkless.com/freehold/\">Freehold</a>,\
      \ a project which is now continuing in a much larger way on UT2003.</p>\n<p>I\
      \ mostly put this page up as a launching pad to put the source code and supplementary\
      \ tutorials to the xpak mutators in a safe place. With the release of the XXXpak,\
      \ all the source code to the mutators is included with the archive, but I thought\
      \ this would be a good spot to replicate it and the UTutes.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ original Unreal Tournament mod, which added bounty rules, credits, inventory,\
      \ thermonukes and the concept of \"lofting\" with Firestorm rounds. Containment\
      \ is probably my favorite game mode here, a more objective based gameplay than\
      \ Invasion. Unreal XL will be the successor to this project it seems.</p>\n\
      <p><b><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://webcosa.com/xpak.html\"\
      >XXXpak</a></b>: 36 mutators for UT2003 in one package. The XXXpak can't be\
      \ discussed on the official Atari forums because they think it's about pr0n.\
      \ These mutators will not be getting a direct UT2004 port, instead they will\
      \ be rolled into Unreal XL.</p>\n<p><b><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
      \ text\" href=\"http://webcosa.com/riftwar/\">Riftwar</a></b>: Riftwar was one\
      \ of the (if not the) first mods for UT2003 to introduce class-based gameplay\
      \ (<a href=\"/Legacy:Making_A_Class-Based_Mod\" title=\"Legacy:Making A Class-Based\
      \ Mod\">Making_A_Class-Based_Mod</a>). It also broke the two team barrier and\
      \ was the first mod to introduce persistance in the form of a war campaign.\
      \ Three races, Humans, Aliens and the Undead, cross between their homeworlds\
      \ trying to control all three. Riftwar won first place for Gametype in Phase\
      \ 1 of the MSUC, won third place for phase 2 and was a finalist in phase 3.</p>\n\
      <p>I haven't updated Riftwar's site in some time. The secret hidden link to\
      \ the latest UT2004 version is <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"\
      http://www.webcosa.com/riftwar/rgxriftwar.zip\">here</a></p>\n<p>Wong keeps\

      \ Riftwar once again.</p>\n<p><b><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\"\
      \ href=\"http://webcosa.com/grind/\">Grind</a></b>: Grind is a movement mod,\
      \ and I was trying to combine the gameplay of things like Jet Set Radio with\
      \ things like Mario and, of course, Quake. Everyone starts with electroskates\
      \ and a velocity gun and you get kills mostly by ramming other players at high\
      \ speeds. Grind is also a finalist for Phase 2 of the MSUC.</p>\n<p><b><a rel=\"\

      >Unreal XL</a></b>: Unreal XL is the successor to both Freehold and XXXpak,\
      \ and in the end will quite likely be massive. It introduces true akimbo weapons\
      \ (any weapon with some tweaking and a few limitations can be made akimbo w/\
      \ any other weapon), weapon augments, personal augments, a flexible loadout,\
      \ economy rules (including the bounty/balance system of Freehold), three large\
      \ mutators (Games XL, Players XL, Weapons XL), new game modes (probably a Containment\
      \ clone and a War Campaign mode), and god know what else I can cram in. The\
      \ UXL mutators were an honorable mention in the MSUC. I'm currently looking\
      \ at the akimbo &amp; augment system to see what works best. The gametypes might\
      \ get worked into UDS instead.</p>\n<p><b><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\

      \ Force Omega</a></b>: Defense Force Omega is probably going to be one of my\
      \ ambitious pieces. It is a pure coop, squad based game suited best for 3-5\
      \ people. The premise is that the Earth is under attack from an invading horde\
      \ which is slowly reforming the planet under the darkness of night. There will\
      \ be two basic modes, one where you plan and strategize at your home base, and\
      \ then executing missions - which are planned to be all Darkmatch style night\
      \ and randomly generated. DFO is very alpha right now, but is due to be released\
      \ for Phase 3 of the MSUC.</p>\n<p><b>Unreal Defense Squad</b> UDS is the lovechild\
      \ of DFO and Unreal. Basically it removes the TC components and places thing\
      \ squarely on the Unreal Universe. I'm working on the single-player portion\
      \ now.</p>\n<p><b>Unreal Tactics</b> Well, UDS is dormant right now. As noted\
      \ in <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://cathodetan.blogspot.com/2005/01/dev-day-diary-crisis-of-design.html\"\
      >this blog entry</a>, the combination of random/variable maps and bot AI was\
      \ becoming overwhelming. Thing about UT bots - they're very single minded. I\
      \ might do some research to restart it later.</p>\n<p>In it's place, I'm developing\
      \ a new turn based system (offline only). It's modelled after XCom, which much\
      \ of DFO/UDS was anyway, so this will more or less complete the circle. Tactics\
      \ is a working title for now.</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"/Legacy:RegularEngine\" title=\"\

      \ of a mod for people to use and learn from to build their own mods. Includes\

      \ Hunter kindly redesigned UMO's basics and I think it's looks right lovely.\
      \ I've also added unrealmodsbot to the toolbox. umbot is a jabber chatbot (\
      \ unrealmodsbot@jabber.org ), and you can search the UMO database, show mod\

      \ a kindly lightweight quality to umbot that I kinda enjoy.</p>\n<p><b>Sad Update:</b>\
      \ UMO got killed while I was doing a SQL update to delete spammers which were\
      \ flooding the system. Sad that trying to give power to developers resulted\

      \ your own address, why do you ask for mine? Heh.\"\n\nWell, I'll tell you.\
      \  There's this thing called email harvesting.  Spammers spider virtually every\
      \ piece of text they can get their hands on and look for email formats, and\
      \ then they add that to their list.  So now I have a level of anonmynity when\
      \ it comes to my email address, and I try be sure you aren't some soulless evil\
      \ bastard before I give it out.  Why do I ask for yours?  I don't actually,\
      \ but obviously it's required in order to get a response (which this guy didn't\
      \ want, which makes you wonder why he bothered emailing at all).\n\nIn short,\
      \ use the contact form link above.  Spammers are the laziest form of parasites\
      \ and I know they won't bother with it.  If you (or some program in your name)\
      \ sends an email to inkless@inkless.com, it will get this [[Legacy:RegularX/Spam_Response|RegularX/Spam_Response]].\n\
      \n===Quick Bio ===\n\nCompared to some gamers, I'm older than dirt.  I've been\
      \ involved in game modding since Doom, but that was mostly just mapping and\
      \ the like.  My first foray into UT for coding turned out to be [http://inkless.com/freehold/\
      \ Freehold], a project which is now continuing in a much larger way on UT2003.\n\
      \nI mostly put this page up as a launching pad to put the source code and supplementary\
      \ tutorials to the xpak mutators in a safe place.  With the release of the XXXpak,\
      \ all the source code to the mutators is included with the archive, but I thought\
      \ this would be a good spot to replicate it and the UTutes.\n\n===Unreal Projects\
      \ ===\n\nOld Projects:\n\n'''[http://webcosa.com/freehold/ Freehold UT]''':\
      \ My original Unreal Tournament mod, which added bounty rules, credits, inventory,\
      \ thermonukes and the concept of \"lofting\" with Firestorm rounds.  Containment\
      \ is probably my favorite game mode here, a more objective based gameplay than\
      \ Invasion.  Unreal XL will be the successor to this project it seems.\n\n'''[http://webcosa.com/xpak.html\
      \ XXXpak]''': 36 mutators for UT2003 in one package.  The XXXpak can't be discussed\
      \ on the official Atari forums because they think it's about pr0n.  These mutators\
      \ will not be getting a direct UT2004 port, instead they will be rolled into\
      \ Unreal XL.\n\n'''[http://webcosa.com/riftwar/ Riftwar]''': Riftwar was one\
      \ of the (if not the) first mods for UT2003 to introduce class-based gameplay\
      \ ([[Legacy:Making_A_Class-Based_Mod|Making_A_Class-Based_Mod]]).  It also broke\
      \ the two team barrier and was the first mod to introduce persistance in the\
      \ form of a war campaign.  Three races, Humans, Aliens and the Undead, cross\
      \ between their homeworlds trying to control all three.  Riftwar won first place\
      \ for Gametype in Phase 1 of the MSUC, won third place for phase 2 and was a\
      \ finalist in phase 3.\n\nI haven't updated Riftwar's site in some time.  The\
      \ secret hidden link to the latest UT2004 version is  [http://www.webcosa.com/riftwar/rgxriftwar.zip\
      \ here]\n\nWong keeps updating SSP :)  And his new PCP mutator makes me rethink\
      \ the basics of Riftwar once again.\n\n'''[http://webcosa.com/grind/ Grind]''':\
      \ Grind is a movement mod, and I was trying to combine the gameplay of things\
      \ like Jet Set Radio with things like Mario and, of course, Quake.  Everyone\
      \ starts with electroskates and a velocity gun and you get kills mostly by ramming\
      \ other players at high speeds.  Grind is also a finalist for Phase 2 of the\
      \ MSUC.\n\n'''[http://www.ataricommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=371453\
      \ Unreal XL]''': Unreal XL is the successor to both Freehold and XXXpak, and\
      \ in the end will quite likely be massive.  It introduces true akimbo weapons\
      \ (any weapon with some tweaking and a few limitations can be made akimbo w/\
      \ any other weapon), weapon augments, personal augments, a flexible loadout,\
      \ economy rules (including the bounty/balance system of Freehold), three large\
      \ mutators (Games XL, Players XL, Weapons XL), new game modes (probably a Containment\
      \ clone and a War Campaign mode), and god know what else I can cram in.  The\
      \ UXL mutators were an honorable mention in the MSUC.  I'm currently looking\
      \ at the akimbo & augment system to see what works best.  The gametypes might\
      \ get worked into UDS instead.\n\n'''[http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=120589\
      \ Defense Force Omega]''': Defense Force Omega is probably going to be one of\
      \ my ambitious pieces.  It is a pure coop, squad based game suited best for\
      \ 3-5 people.  The premise is that the Earth is under attack from an invading\
      \ horde which is slowly reforming the planet under the darkness of night.  There\
      \ will be two basic modes, one where you plan and strategize at your home base,\
      \ and then executing missions - which are planned to be all Darkmatch style\
      \ night and randomly generated.  DFO is very alpha right now, but is due to\
      \ be released for Phase 3 of the MSUC.\n\n'''Unreal Defense Squad''' UDS is\
      \ the lovechild of DFO and Unreal.  Basically it removes the TC components and\
      \ places thing squarely on the Unreal Universe.  I'm working on the single-player\
      \ portion now.\n\n'''Unreal Tactics''' Well, UDS is dormant right now.   As\
      \ noted in [http://cathodetan.blogspot.com/2005/01/dev-day-diary-crisis-of-design.html\
      \ this blog entry], the combination of random/variable maps and bot AI was becoming\
      \ overwhelming.  Thing about UT bots - they're very single minded.  I might\
      \ do some research to restart it later.\n\nIn it's place, I'm developing a new\
      \ turn based system (offline only).  It's modelled after XCom, which much of\
      \ DFO/UDS was anyway, so this will more or less complete the circle.  Tactics\
      \ is a working title for now.\n\n'''[[Legacy:RegularEngine|RegularEngine]]'''\
      \ - not a mod, per se, but an example of a mod for people to use and learn from\
      \ to build their own mods.  Includes code for player classes, campaign mode\
      \ and versatile key binds. Has a playable example which is a Humans V Skaarj\
      \ campaign.\n\n===UnrealMods.Org ===\n\nI launched '''[http://www.unrealmods.org/\
      \ UnrealMods.Org]''' on April 28th, 2004.  I built UMO out of frustration of\
      \ other mod databases being inclusive and restrictive (or just plain spammy,\
      \ but that's another rant).  \n\n'''Update:''' Hunter kindly redesigned UMO's\
      \ basics and I think it's looks right lovely.  I've also added unrealmodsbot\
      \ to the toolbox. umbot is a jabber chatbot ( unrealmodsbot@jabber.org ), and\
      \ you can search the UMO database, show mod lists, browse news, etc.  I might\
      \ create an AIM version later, but there is a kindly lightweight quality to\
      \ umbot that I kinda enjoy.  \n\n'''Sad Update:''' UMO got killed while I was\
      \ doing a SQL update to delete spammers which were flooding the system.  Sad\
      \ that trying to give power to developers resulted in such a misuse, but that's\
      \ the internet.  The RSS feeds weren't really getting utilized anyway, so I\
      \ will probably rewrite it for just personal use later on.\n\n===Unreal Columns/Writings/Rants\
