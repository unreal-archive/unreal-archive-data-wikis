      \ so unless you want the viewers of your screenshots to get an unhealthy tan\
      \ due to having had to turn their monitor brightness way up, lighten the shots\
      \ up a bit.</li>\n<li>Level correction is often a good idea too. Note that Photoshop's\
      \ Auto levels option tends to make your shot look like badly colourized Laurel\
      \ and Hardy films.</li>\n<li>Cropping the screenshot if often a good idea and\
      \ can create a more striking image. Save your original and try different possibilities.\
      \ Another way is to add a layer in Photoshop that is all black apart from a\
      \ transparent window, and drag this around the image.</li>\n<li>If you want\
      \ to post them in a forum, <b>scale them down</b> (640x480 pixels at most) and\
      \ <b>convert them to .jpg</b> using your favorite image editing program. Nobody\
      \ likes having to use the horizontal scrollbar to view your screenshots completely.</li>\n\
      <li>For show-off screenshots, enter the map <b>in spectator mode</b> so your\
      \ HUD and your weapon don't appear on the shots. Besides, you'll be able to\
      \ get much better camera angles that way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a utility\

      \ to create an animated gif showing how an effect looks like.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ There are programs that you can use to compile an animated gif from a series\
      \ of bitmaps, I don't have a link handy. The only problem with that is that\
      \ you would need to take screenshots rapidly and evenly, unless you wrote a\
      \ class especially for the task that would, for instance, advance a frame of\
      \ the animation/effect/whatever every time you triggered it by some means. (\
      \ like shooting it ) Plus that sounds like something resembling hard work.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Balu:</b> I know those programs, but I don't think you can \"hit\" the\
      \ right frames using screenshots. I was thinking of image like the ones in the\
      \ emitter-examples on UDN: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"\
      http://udn.epicgames.com/pub/Content/EmittersTutorial/acceleration.gif\">http://udn.epicgames.com/pub/Content/EmittersTutorial/acceleration.gif</a></p>\n\
      <p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> Do you want it for a map or just a stand-alone picture?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Balu:</b> Standalone - to create some example pics for this wiki e.g.</p>\n\
      <p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> Ok, try the demo record console command in the game and\
      \ try to find a demo recording converter (to gif or avi).</p>\n<p><b>Balu:</b>\
      \ I've just looked around for ways to do so, but only found <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.perilith.com/movieunrealplusplus/\"\
      >MovieUnreal++</a> - which is for UT only though. Does anyone have something\
      \ like this for UT2003?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Like I said, if you have trouble\
      \ hitting the right frames you could write a class that would advance the frame\
      \ each time it was triggered, so for instance it could monitor the player's\
      \ bExtra0, which isn't used as far as I cn tell but can be bound to a key. You\
      \ could then have it advance one frame each time it was triggered. Alternately\
      \ I believe there is generic video capture software that you could use while\
      \ running UT, but I don't have any specific examples of one.</p>\n<p><b>Balu:</b>\
      \ Anyone willing to undertake the task of doing the <i>you</i>-part of Foxpaws\
      \ idea? I am truly not skilled enough to do so. I'd love to analyze the code\
      \ though and willing to write a doc for the wiki (if I understand a word&#160;;)</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Could't you ensure you hit the right frames by setting\
      \ the game speed to something really low and then thumping the f9 key repeatedly?</p>\n\
      <p><b>Balu:</b> That might be possible, but it's more a workaround... I also\
      \ just found <a href=\"/Legacy:Capturing_Unreal_Video\" title=\"Legacy:Capturing\
      \ Unreal Video\">Capturing_Unreal_Video</a> where this discussion should be\
      \ taken I guess...</p>\n<p><b>ZxAnPhOrIaN:</b> In an ini (i think UT2003), there\
      \ is a variable called something like framerate or framespersecond, set it really\
      \ low, and don't forget to change it back!</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Just skimming\
      \ over this page again, the code to make something that would take screenshots\
      \ repeatedly some distance apart would look something like this:</p>\n<div dir=\"\

      \ for your video, you could set the timedilation low and the FPS in that class\
      \ low. For 30FPS for instance, you could set the FPS in the class to 3 and \"\
      Set LevelInfo TimeDilation 0.1\" on the console. This probrably wouldn't be\
      \ of much help unless your computer can't put out as many FPS as you want the\

      \ badly colourized Laurel and Hardy films.\n* Cropping the screenshot if often\
      \ a good idea and can create a more striking image. Save your original and try\
      \ different possibilities. Another way is to add a layer in Photoshop that is\
      \ all black apart from a transparent window, and drag this around the image.\n\
      * If you want to post them in a forum, '''scale them down''' (640x480 pixels\
      \ at most) and '''convert them to .jpg''' using your favorite image editing\
      \ program.  Nobody likes having to use the horizontal scrollbar to view your\
      \ screenshots completely.\n* For show-off screenshots, enter the map '''in spectator\
      \ mode''' so your HUD and your weapon don't appear on the shots.  Besides, you'll\
      \ be able to get much better camera angles that way.\n\nThere's a utility which\
      \ performs some of the screenshot processing here: http://www.willemssoft.be/english/index1024normal.html\

      \ way to create movies? E.g. to create an animated gif showing how an effect\
      \ looks like.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' There are programs that you can use to compile\
      \ an animated gif from a series of bitmaps, I don't have a link handy. The only\
      \ problem with that is that you would need to take screenshots rapidly and evenly,\
      \ unless you wrote a class especially for the task that would, for instance,\
      \ advance a frame of the animation/effect/whatever every time you triggered\
      \ it by some means. ( like shooting it ) Plus that sounds like something resembling\
      \ hard work.\n\n'''Balu:''' I know those programs, but I don't think you can\
      \ \"hit\" the right frames using screenshots. I was thinking of image like the\
      \ ones in the emitter-examples on UDN: http://udn.epicgames.com/pub/Content/EmittersTutorial/acceleration.gif\n\
      \n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Do you want it for a map or just a stand-alone picture?\n\
      \n'''Balu:''' Standalone - to create some example pics for this wiki e.g.\n\n\
      '''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Ok, try the demo record console command in the game and try\
      \ to find a demo recording converter (to gif or avi).\n\n'''Balu:''' I've just\
      \ looked around for ways to do so, but only found [http://www.perilith.com/movieunrealplusplus/\
      \ MovieUnreal++] - which is for UT only though. Does anyone have something like\
      \ this for UT2003?\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Like I said, if you have trouble hitting\
      \ the right frames you could write a class that would advance the frame each\
      \ time it was triggered, so for instance it could monitor the player's bExtra0,\
      \ which isn't used as far as I cn tell but can be bound to a key. You could\
      \ then have it advance one frame each time it was triggered. Alternately I believe\
      \ there is generic video capture software that you could use while running UT,\
      \ but I don't have any specific examples of one.\n\n'''Balu:''' Anyone willing\
      \ to undertake the task of doing the ''you''-part of Foxpaws idea? I am truly\
      \ not skilled enough to do so. I'd love to analyze the code though and willing\
      \ to write a doc for the wiki (if I understand a word ;)\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \ Could't you ensure you hit the right frames by setting the game speed to something\
      \ really low and then thumping the f9 key repeatedly?\n\n'''Balu:''' That might\
      \ be possible, but it's more a workaround... I also just found [[Legacy:Capturing_Unreal_Video|Capturing_Unreal_Video]]\
      \ where this discussion should be taken I guess...\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' In\
      \ an ini (i think UT2003), there is a variable called something like framerate\
      \ or framespersecond, set it really low, and don't forget to change it back!\n\
      \n'''Foxpaw:''' Just skimming over this page again, the code to make something\
      \ that would take screenshots repeatedly some distance apart would look something\
      \ like this:\n\n<uscript>\nclass TimedScreenshots extends Actor;\n\nvar float\
      \ FPS;\nvar float NextShotTime;\n\nfunction PostBeginPlay()\n{\n  NextShotTime\
      \ = Level.TimeSeconds;\n}\n\nfunction Tick(float Delta)\n{\n  while (Level.TimeSeconds\
      \ >= NextShotTime)\n  {\n    ConsoleCommand(\"SShot\");\n    NextShotTime +=\
      \ 1/FPS;\n  }\n}\n\ndefaultproperties\n{\n  bHidden=true\n  FPS=10\n}\n</uscript>\n\
      \nThen you could bind a key to \"Summon WhateverPackage.TimedScreenshots\" and\
      \ another key to \"Killall TimedScreenshots\".\n\nTo get the best results if\
      \ you want a high FPS for your video, you could set the timedilation low and\
      \ the FPS in that class low. For 30FPS for instance, you could set the FPS in\
      \ the class to 3 and \"Set LevelInfo TimeDilation 0.1\" on the console. This\
      \ probrably wouldn't be of much help unless your computer can't put out as many\
      \ FPS as you want the video to have at the detail settings you want for the\
      \ video.\n\n'''DarthDevilous:''' From the current article:\n\n{{innerbox| Unreal\
      \ Tournament stops taking screenshots when you reach <tt>Shot0255.bmp</tt>\n\
      \n}}\n\nThis doesn't seem to be the case in UT2004, I am currently at <tt>Shot00283</tt>.\
      \ Also my Screenshots end up in the /ScreenShots subdirectory. Is this functionality\
      \ new in UT2004 or what? (and could someone update the article appropriatly)\n\
      \n'''Xian:''' I assume that is because you have 2 zeros. It might go up to 9999\
      \ but I am not sure.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]\n[[Category:Legacy\
