      \ You don't want bots around for this. There are several ways of getting rid\
      \ of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run UT normally, and start any practice session with\
      \ 0 bots. Exit the game. UT will remember this setting the next time you playtest\

      Legacy:SinglePlayer (page does not exist)\">SinglePlayer</a>. Remember to change\

      \ href=\"/Legacy:UT_Console\" title=\"Legacy:UT Console\">UT console</a> commands\
      \ remove bots. Hit TAB and type one beforepressing Fire to play. You can bind\
