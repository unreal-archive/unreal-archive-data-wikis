      \ title=\"Legacy:ZoneInfo\">ZoneInfo</a> to pull you throught the tube and out\

      \ ZoneVelocity and add a - infront of the number you put in Y. Ex- 3000 pushed\
      \ you back. -3000 should pull you in. If that isn't the case and it pushes you\
      \ to the top or bottom or side, then you may have to change the velocity number.\
      \ Ex- If Y - 3000 pushed you to the top, then X or Z - 3000 might pull you to\

      \ 2. Step into Tube 3 Then You come out Tube 4 and then repeats itself. Don't\
      \ even try and make it go both ways because I don't think thats possible.</p>\n\
