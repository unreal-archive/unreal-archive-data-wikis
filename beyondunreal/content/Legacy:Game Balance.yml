    text: "<p>Game balance is something which it seems a lot of developers out there,\
      \ amateur and professional alike, overemphasise. What is game balance? It is\
      \ the level of equality in value of all choices a player (or bot) can make.\
      \ Now, game balance is important, but not in a strict way. Should a game have\
      \ any lasting enjoyment to it, the choices available to a player should amount\
      \ to more than a dry technical weighing. If the numbers going into damage, strength,\
      \ or whatever you are working with are so important that they need to be perfect,\
      \ then your player can logically come to only two conclusions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>One\
      \ item is superior and should be used whenever possible. This removes all of\
      \ the interest gained through variety in your game.</li>\n<li>Two or more items\
      \ are equally good, and the choice does not matter, so the player's choices\
      \ really don't mean anything. It's pointless.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<div id=\"\

      \ can you avoid imbalance in your game, without making it dry and boring? Let's\
      \ just say we're balancing weapons right now. The above points become demonstratable.\
      \ You have three weapons:</p>\n<p>One does 10 damage and can attack once a second.</p>\n\
      <p>One does 20 damage and can attack once in two seconds.</p>\n<p>One does 50\
      \ damage and can attack once in four seconds.</p>\n<p>The value becomes apparent\
      \ in the simple math of damage / rate, coming out to 10, 10, and 12.5. You can\
      \ manipulate those numbers your entire life and never get around the two problems\
      \ illustrated above.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Beginning_of_a_Solution\"\
      >The Beginning of a Solution</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Game_Balance?section=2\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: The Beginning of a Solution\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The above example not only\
      \ demonstrates a problem, but a solution. A player's choice needs to be able\
      \ to make a difference. In the above example, you might have noticed there are\
      \ times when the value of the weapons changes.</p>\n<p>If your opponent is at\
      \ 30 health, using the first and then the second weapon will result in 3 seconds\
      \ rather than four to kill it, despite the better rate of damage. Likewise at\
      \ 20, either the first or the second will yield half the time to kill the opponent.</p>\n\
      <p>I call this the beginning of a solution, however, for a reason. These are\
      \ situational advantages, and are often overemphasised just like balnace in\
      \ general is. The fact of the matter is, these choices can be mathmatically\
      \ weighed and decided on bringing you right back to the original two problems.</p>\n\
      <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Where_It.27s_At\">Where It's At</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Game_Balance?section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Where It's\
      \ At\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>So let's take the example into greater detail. Let's talk about a first person\
      \ shooter. Let's say the first weapon hits so long as the victim is visible,\
      \ the second is an instantfire weapon, and the third is a projectile weapon.\
      \ Now we can say:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The weapon does 10 damage in 1 second if you\
      \ can see the victim.</li>\n<li>The weapon does 20 damage in 2 seconds if you\
      \ are aiming directly at the victim.</li>\n<li>The weapon does 50 damage in\
      \ 4 seconds if you are aiming at the point of intersection between the victim's\
      \ eventual path and your projectile's path.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, the picture\
      \ has changed. We're talking about conditional statements. Thus, the previous\
      \ calculated values would be multiplied by a .##% probability of the condition\
      \ being true. In this case, those numbers are impossible to calculate, but instead\
      \ hinge, for the first time, on the specific player in control. A good player\
      \ in a first person shooter is someone able to make those conditions come up\
      \ true for them more often, and for their opponents less.</p>\n<p>So now weighing\
      \ these options and their worth depends on your best assessment of a player's\
      \ relative skill with weapons. Hitting someone directly with an instantfire\
      \ weapon is easier for most than with a projectile.</p>\n<p>Understanding that\
      \ it is these differences in skills, not the differences in power of the weapons,\
      \ which creates lasting fun. A lot of people love matches with single instant-fire\
      \ weapons... Avoiding that whole argument all together, I'll just point out\
      \ a fact from this: This is ground down to a complete lack of balance issues...\
      \ and I believe it's that which makes them so popular. Not because they're perfectly\
      \ balanced, exactly, but because it's \"all skill.\" It's a pure contest of\
      \ ability, but of a smaller set of abilities. Someone is going to win, and the\
      \ only variable is skill (and ping/fps but let's not get into that.)</p>\n<p>So\
      \ that's really what balance is all about. It's the technical balance itself,\
      \ but the best arrangement of your variables to allow skill to show through\
      \ the most. The goal in any game is to win, and your game should do its best\
      \ to acknowledge who played the better game. Note that this doesn't mean an\
      \ imbalanced game can let a lesser player win (never, unless the players have\
      \ unequal access to items. That kind of situation has the same issues but the\
      \ consequences of a bad design are just worse.) It means that an imbalanced\
      \ game can make a lesser player appear as good as a slightly better player.</p>\n\
      <p>Example: Splash damage weapons. Say you have a simple projectile which does\
      \ 40 damage to everything in the splash radius. This is a bad weapon... why?\
      \ Because one player can be more accurate with the weapon, and do the same damage\
      \ so long as he's within that radius. One can hit the other player directly\
      \ every time (if that's what he wants) and the other can just barely hit that\
      \ radius back... and their aiming skills are judged equivalent by the rules\
      \ of the game. Instead you want a weapon which scales its splash damage with\
      \ distance, so that it makes a better reflection of the player's performance.</p>\n\

      <p>In most games you cannot keep track of all the variables which contribute\
      \ to a player's skill. There are a <b>lot</b> of them. Anything that can vary\
      \ within a situation is a factor. It's near impossible to plan for them and\
      \ simply futile. You shouldn't even care... because these are small. Do not\
      \ expect to have a perfectly balanced game, it's a nice thought, but it's just\
      \ not happening.</p>\n<p>The truth is, as stated before, inbalances in the game\
      \ distort the judgement of skill. A good game should be rigorous in its list\
      \ of abilities it tests, accurate in its judgement, and at the same time favor\
      \ none of them over another. Each little detail doesn't need to be perfectly\
      \ situated, because the variance in skill is by and large dispersed enough that\
      \ they will not come into importance.</p>\n<p>You might never be good at this.\
      \ Any good designer will be a good player, this is a hard fact. To make a good\
      \ game by anything other than luck you have to understand the abilities being\
      \ tested because you're the one testing. A truly good test in anything is created\
      \ by an expert, and you must be an expert. This is not to say you've got to\
      \ be extremely skillful, but you have to understand the skills, which will put\
      \ you at least in the upper realm of players.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Okay, that was\
      \ the main point of this topic right up there. I'm guessing the response would\
      \ have been \"duh,\" or it went over your head. It's really an observation of\
      \ the definitions of all the things which a designer is working with. So I'd\
      \ like to move on and just address some little points.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Chance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Chance, randomness... it's been used a lot in games.\
      \ Of course, the reason I'm talking about it here is because of the <b>misuse</b>\
      \ of chance.</p>\n<p>In reality, things are not random. This goes back to causality.\
      \ There is no little microchip in a gun which decides your shot will vary between\
      \ some percentage of error from where you aim it. We use randomness to represent\
      \ systems which are effected by so many minute variables, it would be ridiculous\
      \ to try and realistically implement them. This is really what we do with computers,\
      \ simulate things from life–not recreate them.</p>\n<p>Randomness, however,\
      \ does NOTHING for a game's design. Ignoring the possibility of people having\
      \ oracular powers, there is nothing to do with skill in this. In fact, this\
      \ is a common misconception with one of my favorite games, poker:</p>\n<p>In\
      \ poker your goal is to make the best five card hand. There are a lot of different\
      \ varieties of poker, but which cards make the best hand and using 5 of them\
      \ remains the same. The hand heirarchy is actually determined by the probability\
      \ of them occuring. Probability plays a big part in all games of \"chance\"\
      \ but it is <b>not</b> what poker is about. Poker is about bets and analysing\
      \ people.</p>\n<p>If you walk up to a slot machine and play, you are pretty\
      \ much an idiot unless you are cheating. I'm sure the people around here are\
      \ smart enough to know why: You can win in the short run, but the average case\
      \ is you're going to lose. Beside oracles, which we are ignoring for this discussion,\
      \ it is impossible for you to have any impact on this outcome. This is as exciting\
      \ as watching anything else in life you cannot control, and there are places\
      \ you can do this without spending your own money.</p>\n<p>Poker, however, is\
      \ different. This is for one basic fact: There are two ways to win at poker.\
      \ One is to have the best hand. One is to get your opponents to fold. If it\
      \ were merely the first, poker would be a pointless game where you're either\
      \ just trading money around and possibly giving up a rake (money payed to the\
      \ house, not the other players, on a per-hand basis.)</p>\n<p>So the primary\
      \ goal of poker, since everyone has an equal chance of having the best hand,\
      \ is to deceive and read your opponents. To make them think what you want them\
      \ to think, and to avoid the same from them. So long as your opponent does not\
      \ have the best possible hand, it is possible to convince them you have a better\
      \ hand. That's what betting is all about. It's saying \"I have a better hand\
      \ than you do. Think I'm lying? Put out the money and find out.\" This is why\
      \ chance is not what makes poker an interesting game, most the time. Chance\
      \ does allow the better player to lose some of the time, but this is actually\
      \ a good thing (for the better player) because it tricks more people into putting\
      \ their money out there. The better player wins over time.</p>\n<p>So bringing\
      \ this into other games... Chance merely makes you look at averages rather than\
      \ one immediate result. It means the better choice won't always win–but it's\
      \ <b>always</b> the better choice. It's necessary in some games (like poker)\
      \ to introduce an unknown quantity which other things can be put upon... by\
      \ itself, however, it's pointless.</p>\n<p>Do not use random variables for whatever\
      \ unless you have an intelligent reason to. It just uses up more resources.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Plus random variables can't be simulated client-side either\
      \ - so there's another reason. Anyways, I was going to post this in response\
      \ to your comment on my developer journal page but it applies here too, so I'll\
      \ compile what I was going to say there and what I was going to say here into\
      \ one:</p>\n<p>One of the neat things about Unreal Tournament (and UT2k3) is\
      \ that the weapons are all inherently different - not just different in fire-rate\
      \ and damage, there is more or less no two weapons that are used the same. In\
      \ essense, each weapon requires a different skill or set of skills to use. This\
      \ makes is very difficult to say that one weapon is \"better\" than another,\
      \ though there's certainately statistical favourites. For instance, if you were\
      \ to go mathematically, the \"best\" weapon is probrably the bio-rifle. (barring\
      \ Instagib) It's fast firing, precise, and dishes out loads of damage. Given\
      \ it's (considerably) greater damage per second, some might say it's the \"\
      best\" weapon. However, it's still considered by many to be about the worst\
      \ weapon you could have. Interestingly, some of the most preferred weapons have\
      \ about the lowest \"stats.\" The shock rifle takes like 3 whole seconds to\
      \ kill a person, and the rocket launcher is not much better. (it's probrably\
      \ worse, if you consider the travel time of the rockets.) Anyways, I'm getting\
      \ a bit off topic.</p>\n<p>In UT, the weapons are all pretty much different\
      \ enough that numerical comparisons are difficult to apply. To take an extreme\
      \ example, flak cannon versus lightning gun/sniper rifle. Arguing numbers between\
      \ the two would be totally senseless - it's clear that the flak cannon does\
      \ a heck of a lot more damage but has a much shorter effective range. In constrast,\
      \ a game like counterstrike is easy to argue numbers over - all the weapons\
      \ are pretty much the same. (Then again, they basically all have about the same\
      \ stopping power anyway, the weakest handgun you can get only takes like 4 shots\
      \ to kill somebody&#160;;) )</p>\n<p>Anyways, I think that's the key thing to\
      \ keeping the variety - keeping the weapons all different. Otherwise there will\
      \ certainately arise a favourite, as is noticeable in UT with the enforcer/assault\
      \ rifle and minigun. This is about the only case where they have two weapons\
      \ that are virtually identical, only the minigun is basically better in every\
      \ way. (Technically it doesn't do as much damage as the enforcer per shot, but\
      \ it shoots a lot faster and is the same style of weapon)</p>\n<p>Now then,\
      \ as for weapons on spacecraft (so the above intro doesn't need to be repeated\
      \ here and on my developer journal) I agree to some extent that weapons in space\
      \ are a bit more limited. However, with some creativity there are some things\
      \ that can make it seem like there's more options. (There isn't really, but\
      \ stuff that hasn't really been done in ground based FPSs anyway) Also, you\
      \ can make use of stuff that would just be considered \"cheap\" on the ground,\
      \ but may take skillful flying to use in space, thus making a weapon that's\
      \ too cheap to see the light of day on the ground be a real \"skill\" weapon\
      \ in space. Anyways, I'll throw out a few ideas that I had:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast\
      \ moving projectile weapons - pretty straightforward.</li>\n<li>Energy draining\
      \ weapons - weapons, projectile or otherwise, that prevent the target from firing\
      \ or makes them lose energy or whatever. Also, they'd do some damage. The fact\
      \ that the enemy can't fire back would make this more effective than a more\
      \ basic weapon, but since it doesn't do that much damage it would take longer\
      \ to kill an enemy, leaving more time for enemy reinforcements to arrive, or\
      \ for them to get away in CTF or something. (risk vs reward, sort of)</li>\n\
      <li>Basic instant hit and continuous beam type weapons.</li>\n<li>Area effect\
      \ type weapons, IE everything near the shooter gets damaged. This would be super\
      \ cheap on the ground, but in space it's probrably much more difficult to stay\
      \ close to an enemy that's avoiding you, introducing some skill.</li>\n<li>Persistant\
      \ damage weapons, like acid or something like that.</li>\n<li>A glue sprayer\
      \ kind of thing. I was thinking kind of like how the biorifle when charged up\
      \ splatters - anyways, the main chunk hits something and then if a splatter\
      \ hits something else than the two things (the thing the main chunk hit and\
      \ the thing the splatter hit) would be stuck together. (maybe somewhat elastically)</li>\n\
      <li>A projectile that kind of \"zig-zags\" along a straight path. This would\
      \ take a fair bit of skill to hit with because you would need the target to\
      \ be a multiple of a certain distance to hit them with it. (IE the projectile\
      \ would have to be crossing over it's center point as it approached them) Kind\
      \ of hard to explain, but I'm sure you see what I mean.</li>\n<li>A projectile\
      \ that you sort of \"charge up\" - basically holding the fire button sets a\
      \ timer on it, so you'd hold the fire button for say a half a second and then\
      \ release it, the projectile fires out and detonates two seconds after. Or something.\
      \ Basically the flight time is dictated by the time spent holding down the fire\
      \ button. THe projectile could do virtually no damage if it impacted something,\
      \ but the explosion would do lots.</li>\n<li>Kind of like the above, only harder\
      \ to do and maybe more effective - primary fire launches the projectile, which\
      \ travels through things without hitting them. Alt-fire makes a sort of \"force\
      \ cage\" around the projectile. The projectile would move pretty fast, so you'd\
      \ have to have good timing to make the cage coalsce while the projectile was\
      \ very near the target.</li>\n<li>A delayed-fire weapon of some kind - basically\
      \ you fire the weapon, then the location and rotation of the shot are locked\
      \ in (maybe the ship could launch some kind of a gun-drone or something to justify\
      \ the location and rotation of the shot not following the ship that fired it)\
      \ and a short time afterward the gun fires. This would require something sort\
      \ of like leading the target, but maybe different. It could be a relatively\
      \ easy weapon to hit with (like maybe a really fat beam or something) so would\
      \ primarily serve to force the target to change course to avoid getting hit.\
      \ It could also work well in concert with the glue weapon above.</li>\n<li>A\
      \ two-part projectile.. firing drops a mine kind of thing and shoots a projectile,\
      \ then alt-fire makes an instant-fire shot between the mine and the projectile.\
      \ (This might be kind of hard to hit people with)</li>\n<li>An \"instant hit\"\
      \ weapon that just creates a small explosion a certain distance ahead of the\
      \ ship, with some accompanying beam effect or something to make it plausable.\
      \ This would require good depth perception and range estimation ability.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>Anyways, just thought I'd throw out some ideas to help you come up\
      \ with weapons.</p>\n<p><b>Haral:</b> No doubt and no doubt. Having more than\
      \ one weapon that acts the same way, for the reasons I pretty much detailed\
      \ already, is pointless. I didn't really go into that as it was more on the\
      \ subject of balancing what you have rather than introducing new items.</p>\n\
      <p>As for coming up with weapons, I don't have too much trouble with that. A\
      \ lot of \"different\" effects can be introduced, it's just hard coming up with\
      \ <b>simple</b> variety. I've grown to the philosophy that no single thing in\
      \ a game should ever be complicated, although the end result might be. In my\
      \ mod I'm currently not too satisfied with many of the weapons I've made because\
      \ they're too awkward or specialised... I think I only really like one of them\
      \ so far, and I've made 8 so far. – That is, weapons like your \"zig-zag\" ones\
      \ are of a good variety, but ones that involve shooting out multiple projectiles,\
      \ etc are a bit too complicated.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ drop all their inventory. A weapon that swaps your location with your opponent's.\
      \ <i>OR</i> Make weapons that affect only certain attributes. Make a weapon\
      \ that strips armor or one that bypasses armor, but does little damage...</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Balance weapons by their attributes:</b> Ammo Capacity,\

      \ Accuracy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These all relate into a simple system of Effective\
      \ Damage Over Time. When comparing weapons that just deal damage, you're balancing\
      \ two tangible things: Effectiveness in hitting target and damage inflicted\

      \ kill with one hit is not a challenging game but it is very balanced. On the\
      \ other hand, a game with a weapon that kills a target in four hits compared\
      \ to another weapon that kills in one hit...the balancing factors here are clear\
      \ (how reliable are the weapons in hitting their target, and how long does it\
      \ take to fire subsquent shots?).</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time\

  wikitext:
    text: "Game balance is something which it seems a lot of developers out there,\
      \ amateur and professional alike, overemphasise.  What is game balance?  It\
      \ is the level of equality in value of all choices a player (or bot) can make.\
      \  Now, game balance is important, but not in a strict way.  Should a game have\
      \ any lasting enjoyment to it, the choices available to a player should amount\
      \ to more than a dry technical weighing.  If the numbers going into damage,\
      \ strength, or whatever you are working with are so important that they need\
      \ to be perfect, then your player can logically come to only two conclusions:\n\
      \n# One item is superior and should be used whenever possible.  This removes\
      \ all of the interest gained through variety in your game.\n# Two or more items\
      \ are equally good, and the choice does not matter, so the player's choices\
      \ really don't mean anything.  It's pointless.\n\n==The Problem==\n\nHow can\
      \ you avoid imbalance in your game, without making it dry and boring?  Let's\
      \ just say we're balancing weapons right now.  The above points become demonstratable.\
      \  You have three weapons:\n\nOne does 10 damage and can attack once a second.\n\
      \nOne does 20 damage and can attack once in two seconds.\n\nOne does 50 damage\
      \ and can attack once in four seconds.\n\nThe value becomes apparent in the\
      \ simple math of damage / rate, coming out to 10, 10, and 12.5.  You can manipulate\
      \ those numbers your entire life and never get around the two problems illustrated\
      \ above.\n\n==The Beginning of a Solution==\n\nThe above example not only demonstrates\
      \ a problem, but a solution.  A player's choice needs to be able to make a difference.\
      \  In the above example, you might have noticed there are times when the value\
      \ of the weapons changes.\n\nIf your opponent is at 30 health, using the first\
      \ and then the second weapon will result in 3 seconds rather than four to kill\
      \ it, despite the better rate of damage.  Likewise at 20, either the first or\
      \ the second will yield half the time to kill the opponent.\n\nI call this the\
      \ beginning of a solution, however, for a reason.  These are situational advantages,\
      \ and are often overemphasised just like balnace in general is.  The fact of\
      \ the matter is, these choices can be mathmatically weighed and decided on bringing\
      \ you right back to the original two problems.\n\n==Where It's At==\n\nSo let's\
      \ take the example into greater detail.  Let's talk about a first person shooter.\
      \  Let's say the first weapon hits so long as the victim is visible, the second\
      \ is an instantfire weapon, and the third is a projectile weapon.  Now we can\
      \ say:\n\n# The weapon does 10 damage in 1 second if you can see the victim.\n\
      # The weapon does 20 damage in 2 seconds if you are aiming directly at the victim.\n\
      # The weapon does 50 damage in 4 seconds if you are aiming at the point of intersection\
      \ between the victim's eventual path and your projectile's path.\n\nNow, the\
      \ picture has changed.  We're talking about conditional statements.  Thus, the\
      \ previous calculated values would be multiplied by a .##% probability of the\
      \ condition being true.  In this case, those numbers are impossible to calculate,\
      \ but instead hinge, for the first time, on the specific player in control.\
      \  A good player in a first person shooter is someone able to make those conditions\
      \ come up true for them more often, and for their opponents less.\n\nSo now\
      \ weighing these options and their worth depends on your best assessment of\
      \ a player's relative skill with weapons.  Hitting someone directly with an\
      \ instantfire weapon is easier for most than with a projectile.\n\nUnderstanding\
      \ that it is these differences in skills, not the differences in power of the\
      \ weapons, which creates lasting fun.  A lot of people love matches with single\
      \ instant-fire weapons...  Avoiding that whole argument all together, I'll just\
      \ point out a fact from this:  This is ground down to a complete lack of balance\
      \ issues... and I believe it's that which makes them so popular.  Not because\
      \ they're perfectly balanced, exactly, but because it's \"all skill.\"  It's\
      \ a pure contest of ability, but of a smaller set of abilities.  Someone is\
      \ going to win, and the only variable is skill (and ping/fps but let's not get\
      \ into that.)\n\nSo that's really what balance is all about.  It's the technical\
      \ balance itself, but the best arrangement of your variables to allow skill\
      \ to show through the most.  The goal in any game is to win, and your game should\
      \ do its best to acknowledge who played the better game.  Note that this doesn't\
      \ mean an imbalanced game can let a lesser player win (never, unless the players\
      \ have unequal access to items.  That kind of situation has the same issues\
      \ but the consequences of a bad design are just worse.)  It means that an imbalanced\
      \ game can make a lesser player appear as good as a slightly better player.\n\
      \nExample:  Splash damage weapons.  Say you have a simple projectile which does\
      \ 40 damage to everything in the splash radius.  This is a bad weapon... why?\
      \  Because one player can be more accurate with the weapon, and do the same\
      \ damage so long as he's within that radius.  One can hit the other player directly\
      \ every time (if that's what he wants) and the other can just barely hit that\
      \ radius back... and their aiming skills are judged equivalent by the rules\
      \ of the game.  Instead you want a weapon which scales its splash damage with\
      \ distance, so that it makes a better reflection of the player's performance.\n\
      \n==The Facts of Life==\n\nIn most games you cannot keep track of all the variables\
      \ which contribute to a player's skill.  There are a '''lot''' of them.  Anything\
      \ that can vary within a situation is a factor.  It's near impossible to plan\
      \ for them and simply futile.  You shouldn't even care... because these are\
      \ small.  Do not expect to have a perfectly balanced game, it's a nice thought,\
      \ but it's just not happening.\n\nThe truth is, as stated before, inbalances\
      \ in the game distort the judgement of skill.  A good game should be rigorous\
      \ in its list of abilities it tests, accurate in its judgement, and at the same\
      \ time favor none of them over another.  Each little detail doesn't need to\
      \ be perfectly situated, because the variance in skill is by and large dispersed\
      \ enough that they will not come into importance.\n\nYou might never be good\
      \ at this.  Any good designer will be a good player, this is a hard fact.  To\
      \ make a good game by anything other than luck you have to understand the abilities\
      \ being tested because you're the one testing.  A truly good test in anything\
      \ is created by an expert, and you must be an expert.  This is not to say you've\
      \ got to be extremely skillful, but you have to understand the skills, which\
      \ will put you at least in the upper realm of players.\n\n----\n\nOkay, that\
      \ was the main point of this topic right up there.  I'm guessing the response\
      \ would have been \"duh,\" or it went over your head.  It's really an observation\
      \ of the definitions of all the things which a designer is working with.  So\
      \ I'd like to move on and just address some little points.\n\n==Chance==\n\n\
      Chance, randomness... it's been used a lot in games.  Of course, the reason\
      \ I'm talking about it here is because of the '''misuse''' of chance.\n\nIn\
      \ reality, things are not random.  This goes back to causality.  There is no\
      \ little microchip in a gun which decides your shot will vary between some percentage\
      \ of error from where you aim it.  We use randomness to represent systems which\
      \ are effected by so many minute variables, it would be ridiculous to try and\
      \ realistically implement them.  This is really what we do with computers, simulate\
      \ things from life&ndash;not recreate them.\n\nRandomness, however, does NOTHING\
      \ for a game's design.  Ignoring the possibility of people having oracular powers,\
      \ there is nothing to do with skill in this.  In fact, this is a common misconception\
      \ with one of my favorite games, poker:\n\nIn poker your goal is to make the\
      \ best five card hand.  There are a lot of different varieties of poker, but\
      \ which cards make the best hand and using 5 of them remains the same.  The\
      \ hand heirarchy is actually determined by the probability of them occuring.\
      \  Probability plays a big part in all games of \"chance\" but it is '''not'''\
      \ what poker is about.  Poker is about bets and analysing people.\n\nIf you\
      \ walk up to a slot machine and play, you are pretty much an idiot unless you\
      \ are cheating.  I'm sure the people around here are smart enough to know why:\
      \  You can win in the short run, but the average case is you're going to lose.\
      \  Beside oracles, which we are ignoring for this discussion, it is impossible\
      \ for you to have any impact on this outcome.  This is as exciting as watching\
      \ anything else in life you cannot control, and there are places you can do\
      \ this without spending your own money.\n\nPoker, however, is different.  This\
      \ is for one basic fact:  There are two ways to win at poker.  One is to have\
      \ the best hand.  One is to get your opponents to fold.  If it were merely the\
      \ first, poker would be a pointless game where you're either just trading money\
      \ around and possibly giving up a rake (money payed to the house, not the other\
      \ players, on a per-hand basis.)\n\nSo the primary goal of poker, since everyone\
      \ has an equal chance of having the best hand, is to deceive and read your opponents.\
      \  To make them think what you want them to think, and to avoid the same from\
      \ them.  So long as your opponent does not have the best possible hand, it is\
      \ possible to convince them you have a better hand.  That's what betting is\
      \ all about.  It's saying \"I have a better hand than you do.  Think I'm lying?\
      \  Put out the money and find out.\"  This is why chance is not what makes poker\
      \ an interesting game, most the time.  Chance does allow the better player to\
      \ lose some of the time, but this is actually a good thing (for the better player)\
      \ because it tricks more people into putting their money out there.  The better\
      \ player wins over time.\n\nSo bringing this into other games... Chance merely\
      \ makes you look at averages rather than one immediate result.  It means the\
      \ better choice won't always win&ndash;but it's '''always''' the better choice.\
      \  It's necessary in some games (like poker) to introduce an unknown quantity\
      \ which other things can be put upon... by itself, however, it's pointless.\n\
      \nDo not use random variables for whatever unless you have an intelligent reason\
      \ to.  It just uses up more resources.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' Plus random variables\
      \ can't be simulated client-side either - so there's another reason. Anyways,\
      \ I was going to post this in response to your comment on my developer journal\
      \ page but it applies here too, so I'll compile what I was going to say there\
      \ and what I was going to say here into one:\n\nOne of the neat things about\
      \ Unreal Tournament (and UT2k3) is that the weapons are all inherently different\
      \ - not just different in fire-rate and damage, there is more or less no two\
      \ weapons that are used the same. In essense, each weapon requires a different\
      \ skill or set of skills to use. This makes is very difficult to say that one\
      \ weapon is \"better\" than another, though there's certainately statistical\
      \ favourites. For instance, if you were to go mathematically, the \"best\" weapon\
      \ is probrably the bio-rifle. (barring Instagib) It's fast firing, precise,\
      \ and dishes out loads of damage. Given it's (considerably) greater damage per\
      \ second, some might say it's the \"best\" weapon. However, it's still considered\
      \ by many to be about the worst weapon you could have. Interestingly, some of\
      \ the most preferred weapons have about the lowest \"stats.\" The shock rifle\
      \ takes like 3 whole seconds to kill a person, and the rocket launcher is not\
      \ much better. (it's probrably worse, if you consider the travel time of the\
      \ rockets.) Anyways, I'm getting a bit off topic.\n\nIn UT, the weapons are\
      \ all pretty much different enough that numerical comparisons are difficult\
      \ to apply. To take an extreme example, flak cannon versus lightning gun/sniper\
      \ rifle. Arguing numbers between the two would be totally senseless - it's clear\
      \ that the flak cannon does a heck of a lot more damage but has a much shorter\
      \ effective range. In constrast, a game like counterstrike is easy to argue\
      \ numbers over - all the weapons are pretty much the same. (Then again, they\
      \ basically all have about the same stopping power anyway, the weakest handgun\
      \ you can get only takes like 4 shots to kill somebody ;) )\n\nAnyways, I think\
      \ that's the key thing to keeping the variety - keeping the weapons all different.\
      \ Otherwise there will certainately arise a favourite, as is noticeable in UT\
      \ with the enforcer/assault rifle and minigun. This is about the only case where\
      \ they have two weapons that are virtually identical, only the minigun is basically\
      \ better in every way. (Technically it doesn't do as much damage as the enforcer\
      \ per shot, but it shoots a lot faster and is the same style of weapon)\n\n\
      Now then, as for weapons on spacecraft (so the above intro doesn't need to be\
      \ repeated here and on my developer journal) I agree to some extent that weapons\
      \ in space are a bit more limited. However, with some creativity there are some\
      \ things that can make it seem like there's more options. (There isn't really,\
      \ but stuff that hasn't really been done in ground based FPSs anyway) Also,\
      \ you can make use of stuff that would just be considered \"cheap\" on the ground,\
      \ but may take skillful flying to use in space, thus making a weapon that's\
      \ too cheap to see the light of day on the ground be a real \"skill\" weapon\
      \ in space. Anyways, I'll throw out a few ideas that I had:\n\n* Fast moving\
      \ projectile weapons - pretty straightforward.\n* Energy draining weapons -\
      \ weapons, projectile or otherwise, that prevent the target from firing or makes\
      \ them lose energy or whatever. Also, they'd do some damage. The fact that the\
      \ enemy can't fire back would make this more effective than a more basic weapon,\
      \ but since it doesn't do that much damage it would take longer to kill an enemy,\
      \ leaving more time for enemy reinforcements to arrive, or for them to get away\
      \ in CTF or something. (risk vs reward, sort of)\n* Basic instant hit and continuous\
      \ beam type weapons.\n* Area effect type weapons, IE everything near the shooter\
      \ gets damaged. This would be super cheap on the ground, but in space it's probrably\
      \ much more difficult to stay close to an enemy that's avoiding you, introducing\
      \ some skill.\n* Persistant damage weapons, like acid or something like that.\n\
      * A glue sprayer kind of thing. I was thinking kind of like how the biorifle\
      \ when charged up splatters - anyways, the main chunk hits something and then\
      \ if a splatter hits something else than the two things (the thing the main\
      \ chunk hit and the thing the splatter hit) would be stuck together. (maybe\
      \ somewhat elastically)\n* A projectile that kind of \"zig-zags\" along a straight\
      \ path. This would take a fair bit of skill to hit with because you would need\
      \ the target to be a multiple of a certain distance to hit them with it. (IE\
      \ the projectile would have to be crossing over it's center point as it approached\
      \ them) Kind of hard to explain, but I'm sure you see what I mean.\n* A projectile\
      \ that you sort of \"charge up\" - basically holding the fire button sets a\
      \ timer on it, so you'd hold the fire button for say a half a second and then\
      \ release it, the projectile fires out and detonates two seconds after. Or something.\
      \ Basically the flight time is dictated by the time spent holding down the fire\
      \ button. THe projectile could do virtually no damage if it impacted something,\
      \ but the explosion would do lots.\n* Kind of like the above, only harder to\
      \ do and maybe more effective - primary fire launches the projectile, which\
      \ travels through things without hitting them. Alt-fire makes a sort of \"force\
      \ cage\" around the projectile. The projectile would move pretty fast, so you'd\
      \ have to have good timing to make the cage coalsce while the projectile was\
      \ very near the target.\n* A delayed-fire weapon of some kind - basically you\
      \ fire the weapon, then the location and rotation of the shot are locked in\
      \ (maybe the ship could launch some kind of a gun-drone or something to justify\
      \ the location and rotation of the shot not following the ship that fired it)\
      \ and a short time afterward the gun fires. This would require something sort\
      \ of like leading the target, but maybe different. It could be a relatively\
      \ easy weapon to hit with (like maybe a really fat beam or something) so would\
      \ primarily serve to force the target to change course to avoid getting hit.\
      \ It could also work well in concert with the glue weapon above.\n* A two-part\
      \ projectile.. firing drops a mine kind of thing and shoots a projectile, then\
      \ alt-fire makes an instant-fire shot between the mine and the projectile. (This\
      \ might be kind of hard to hit people with)\n* An \"instant hit\" weapon that\
      \ just creates a small explosion a certain distance ahead of the ship, with\
      \ some accompanying beam effect or something to make it plausable. This would\
      \ require good depth perception and range estimation ability.\n\nAnyways, just\
      \ thought I'd throw out some ideas to help you come up with weapons.\n\n'''Haral:'''\
      \ No doubt and no doubt.  Having more than one weapon that acts the same way,\
      \ for the reasons I pretty much detailed already, is pointless.  I didn't really\
      \ go into that as it was more on the subject of balancing what you have rather\
      \ than introducing new items.\n\nAs for coming up with weapons, I don't have\
      \ too much trouble with that.  A lot of \"different\" effects can be introduced,\
      \ it's just hard coming up with '''simple''' variety.  I've grown to the philosophy\
      \ that no single thing in a game should ever be complicated, although the end\
      \ result might be.  In my mod I'm currently not too satisfied with many of the\
      \ weapons I've made because they're too awkward or specialised...  I think I\
      \ only really like one of them so far, and I've made 8 so far.  &ndash; That\
      \ is, weapons like your \"zig-zag\" ones are of a good variety, but ones that\
      \ involve shooting out multiple projectiles, etc are a bit too complicated.\n\

      \ and Accuracy.\n\nThese all relate into a simple system of Effective Damage\
      \ Over Time. When comparing weapons that just deal damage, you're balancing\
      \ two tangible things: Effectiveness in hitting target and damage inflicted\
      \ when the target is hit. Obviously a game with weapons that always hit and\
      \ kill with one hit is not a challenging game but it is very balanced. On the\
      \ other hand, a game with a weapon that kills a target in four hits compared\
      \ to another weapon that kills in one hit...the balancing factors here are clear\
      \ (how reliable are the weapons in hitting their target, and how long does it\
      \ take to fire subsquent shots?)."
