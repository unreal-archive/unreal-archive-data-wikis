      \ 1&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This command provides a rather dodgy 3rd person perspective\

      \ &lt;value&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>In UT this command can be used without the <i>value</i>\
      \ parameter to cycle through the 10 brightness values. In Devastation the command\
      \ can take a value between 0 and 1. If a value is not specified then a brightness\
      \ of 0.5 is used.</dd>\n<dt>CONTRAST &lt;value&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Sets the\

      <dt>ENDFULLSCREEN&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Go back to playing in a window.</dd>\n<dt>FLUSH&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Flush all caches. Regenerates all lighting, 3D hardware textures, etc. Can\

      <dd>Get a list of color depths supported by your 3D hardware</dd>\n<dt>GETCURRENTCOLORDEPTH&#160;</dt>\n\

      ; DISCONNECT : Disconnect from the current server.\n; ENDFULLSCREEN : Go back\
      \ to playing in a window.\n; FLUSH : Flush all caches. Regenerates all lighting,\

      \ e.g. \"SETRES 1280x800\"\n; HIDEACTORS : Hides '''all''' actors during game\
      \ play.\n; NETSPEED <number> : Change your desired network data rate.  Use 2600\
      \ for modem, 5000 for ISDN, 10000 for ADSL/Cable, and 20000 for LAN.\n; OPEN\
