      \ the <b>IAmTheOne</b> command.</p>\n<p><b>Dark Pulse:</b> Only in UT versions\
      \ 420 and under. 425 and up no longer need <b>IAmTheOne</b> to enable cheats.</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>AMPHIBIOUS&#160;</dt>\n<dd>(Not in Unreal 1) Enables you to breathe\
      \ underwater for a very very very long time. (About 17 minutes.)</dd>\n<dt>ALLAMMO&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Gives you all the ammo (999) for your current weapons.</dd>\n<dt>CAUSEEVENT\
      \ &lt;event name&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This console command sends the event specified\
      \ to all <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\">Actors</a> on a level\
      \ via the Trigger() function.</dd>\n<dt>FLY&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Fly around (instead\
      \ of walking). Also note that you are also invulnerable to attacks in UT (not\
      \ UT2003). Great for <a href=\"/Legacy:Level_Screenshot\" title=\"Legacy:Level\
      \ Screenshot\">Level Screenshots</a>. See WALK. As of UT2003 the space bar can\
      \ no longer be used to increase your height.</dd>\n<dt>GHOST&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Fly\
      \ around and go through walls (see WALK). In ghost mode you will not be able\
      \ to touch (pickup) any objects.</dd>\n<dt>GOD&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Makes you invincible.\
      \ The conditions that you can get killed when in god mode are: telefrag, mover\
      \ kills, typing in walk while in ghost mode in solid space, etc. The Killz in\
      \ UT2003 onwards also causes death while in God mode. Useful for killing cheating\
      \ players if they fall a long way.</dd>\n<dt>INVISIBLE&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Makes\
      \ you completely invisible. This will not work in a networked game.</dd>\n<dt>LOADED&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>(Not Unreal 1) Gives you all the weapons and full ammo (default Max Ammo\
      \ amounts) for them. As of UT2004, superweapons are only given a single shot,\
      \ not 999 ammo as with the other weapons.</dd>\n<dt>SETJUMPZ &lt;height&gt;&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>This allows you to set the height to which you will jump.</dd>\n<dt>SETSPEED\
      \ &lt;speed&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This allows you to set the speed at which you\
      \ move.</dd>\n<dt>SLOMO &lt;Decimal percent (1.00 is 100%)&gt;&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>This allows you to set the speed at which the level plays. Fun to play at\
      \ 0.01</dd>\n<dt>SUMMON &lt;package&gt;.&lt;class&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This command\
      \ allows you to summon objects into the level. The package and class names specified\
      \ with the command are not case sensitive as of UT2004. Not all objects are\
      \ \"summonable\". If an object fails to appear, check your game log file for\
      \ error messages. Try summoning a 'warheadlauncher' or a 'pammo'</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>KILLALL &lt;package name&gt;.&lt;class name&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Kills\
      \ all actors of a certain class, for example <code>killall Botpack.WarheadLauncher</code>.</dd>\n\
      <dt>KILLPAWNS&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Kills all pawns. This includes bots, monsters,\
      \ assault objectives, etc.</dd>\n<dt>WALK&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Returns you to normal\
      \ walking mode after flying or ghosting around a level. It's a good idea to\
      \ make sure you are slightly above the ground with plenty of space around you\
      \ before re-entering walk mode.</dd>\n<dt>PLAYERSONLY&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Pauses\
      \ all non-player actors in the game. Cool for debugging scripts, taking screenshots.</dd>\n\
      <dt>VIEWCLASS &lt;class name&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Cycle through actors of this\
      \ class, on your team in teamgames, viewing from their locaton (for example,\
      \ <code>viewclass bot</code>). Note that this command will only allow a view\
      \ from an Actor that is a player or a spectator. It may also work on network\
      \ games as not a cheat.</dd>\n<dt>CHEATVIEW &lt;class name&gt;&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Cycle through actors of this class, on the enemy team in teamgames, viewing\
      \ from their location (for example, <code>viewclass bot</code>). Note that this\
      \ command will only allow a view from an Actor that is a player or a spectator.</dd>\n\
      <dt>EDITACTOR CLASS=&lt;class&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Switch UT into windowed mode\
      \ first, then replace &lt;class&gt; with 'zone' to edit the zone your player\
      \ is in, 'weapon' to edit the weapon you are holding, and 'pawn' to edit your\
      \ current player. Be careful as you can really screw up things if you're not.</dd>\n\
      <dt>EDITDEFAULT CLASS=&lt;class&gt;&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Same as EDITACTOR, but edits\
      \ the default properties for all actors of the class type. (Works in UT2003/2004;\
      \ confirm for UT?)</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> Editactor and Editdefault\
      \ are listed under Debugging Console Commands. Should they be here also?</p>\n\
      <p><b>DemonThing:</b> They could be used for cheating too. Consider \"EDITACTOR\
      \ CLASS=xPawn\". You could change your health to 10000&#160;:p Then again, SET\
      \ could also be used.</p>\n<p><b>amitakartok:</b> GOD doesn't grant complete\
      \ invincibility. For example, the Vortex Generator superweapon from the ChaosUT\
      \ mod works by sucking in players at a radius of 10 meters and killing them.\
      \ I tested, and the vortex pulled me with FLY on, and after several quick swings\
      \ around it, I touched the center and was gibbed. When I wasn't in range, something\
      \ slowly dragged me down to the ground after one activation, so I think the\
      \ weapon works by forcibly creating a GravityZone with a KillZone in the middle.\
      \ This would imply that KillZones can override GOD, however many maps incorporate\
      \ the danger of falling off but not dying with GOD, like Morpheus.</p>\n\n<!--\
