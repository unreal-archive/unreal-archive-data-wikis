      \ cannot be killed by enemy fire, crushing by vehicles, drowning, \"pain\"-causing\
      \ volumes, etc; some things, such as ion satellites, KillZ (e.g. the bottom\
      \ of the pit in Gael), etc. can and will still kill you.</li>\n<li><b>loaded</b>&#160;:\
      \ Gives you all standard weapons, including superweapons, and 999 ammo for all\
      \ except the Redeemer.</li>\n<li><b>allweapons</b>&#160;: Gives you all standard\
      \ weapons.</li>\n<li><b>allammo</b>&#160;: Gives you 999 ammo for all weapons\
      \ you currently carry (again, excluding Redeemer).</li>\n<li><b>fly</b>&#160;:\
      \ Your character flies. Note that in both \"fly\" and \"ghost\" modes, firing\
      \ a guided Redeemer (and sometimes viewing from the Translocator camera) will\
      \ return you to \"walk\" mode.</li>\n<li><b>ghost</b>&#160;: Your character\
      \ flies and can pass through everything in the map. Note that you cannot pick\
      \ anything up in this mode, though you can still fire.</li>\n<li><b>amphibious</b>&#160;:\
      \ Sets the time your character can stay underwater before taking damage to about\
      \ 20 minutes.</li>\n<li><b>invisible</b>&#160;: Makes your character completely\
      \ invisible. Enter again to resume visibility.</li>\n<li><b>walk</b>&#160;:\
      \ Deactivates fly/ghost.</li>\n<li><b>teleport</b>&#160;: Teleports you to approximately\
      \ whatever your crosshair is currently pointing at.</li>\n<li><b>setspeed</b>\
      \ <i>n</i>&#160;: Sets your character's walking/swimming speed to <i>n</i>.\
      \ 1.0 is default; larger values faster, smaller values slower.</li>\n<li><b>changesize</b>\
      \ <i>n</i>&#160;: Scales your character by <i>n</i>. 1.0 is default; lower values\
      \ are smaller, higher values are bigger.</li>\n<li><b>setjumpz</b> <i>n</i>&#160;:\
      \ Sets your character's jump height in Unreal Units (UU) to <i>n</i>. Default\
      \ is approximately 900. 16 UU = 1 foot.</li>\n<li><b>setgravity</b> <i>n</i>&#160;:\
      \ Sets gravity to <i>n</i>. Should be a negative number (default -950) unless\
      \ you want everything to float up into the air. In positive gravity, bots will\
      \ not move unless they somehow come into contact with the ground or another\
      \ walkable surface.</li>\n<li><b>slomo</b> <i>n</i>&#160;: Sets gamespeed to\
      \ <i>n</i>. 1.0 is default; lower values are slower, higher values are faster.</li>\n\
      <li><b>playersonly</b>&#160;: Effectively stops time for everything except your\
      \ character and hovering vehicles (e.g. Goliath, Manta) which will generally\
      \ continue moving in whatever direction they were moving when the command was\
      \ entered. You can only move in this mode; weapon fire does not work. You can,\
      \ however, pick up / capture the flag in CTF and the ball in BR.</li>\n<li><b>freezeall</b>&#160;:\
      \ Same as <b>playersonly</b>, but also stops hovering vehicles.</li>\n<li><b>summon</b>\

      \ it in again to bring the fog back</li>\n<li><b>show all</b>&#160;: shows everything\
      \ as in volumes,paths,spawns points,triggers,everything.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(dont\

      \ to that of the given actor.</li>\n<li><b>viewclass</b> <i>class</i>&#160;:\
