      \ textures, namely it was a steam vent which would eventually have steam pouring\
      \ from the top of a mound.</p>\n<p>I fired up 3DS Max, and roughly modeled what\
      \ looked like a vent, I started with a plane, broken into a 6x6 grid that measured\
      \ 256x256 generic units, converted to editable poly, and then started moving\
      \ the vertices to where I wanted them. <i>Tip: to view the divisions between\
      \ the grid in 3DS Max press F4</i></p>\n<p>I came up with what is shown in <b>Tile\
      \ #01</b></p>\n<p>After this, I added a HSDS modifier and selected the inner\
      \ region, I'll note now, that I wanted the outside square to remain square,\
      \ and with a 0 altitude on the z axis, this would make it easier to place when\
      \ I got into the game, I also went to the lengths to ensure that the center\
      \ vertex was exactly 256 units high, the ones on the north/east/south/west of\
      \ it I made 128 units high (kind of like a + shape of vertices were selected\
      \ and then I moved them to the apropriate height), and the ones on the NE/NW/SE/SW\
      \ (the x shape of the center) I made 48 units, then I shifted them all in the\
      \ x-y plane, while keeping the outside vertices in their original location!</p>\n\
      <p>I selected the inner region as shown in <b>Tile #02</b></p>\n<p>On the right\
      \ hand side in the roll out, I then clicked the subdivide button, which smooths\
      \ the image a lot, this is good, becuase it is supposed to be a steam vent,\
      \ not a sharp spike in the ground, my next task was to drop the center vertice\
      \ (the one that was at 256 height in the Z axis, which you may note is no longer\
      \ this height) down to the ground, ie a zero on the z axis to produce the center\
      \ of the steam vent.</p>\n<p>I could have aditionally tweaked the vertices,\
      \ but didn't because I was a little worried about loosing the smooth effect.</p>\n\
      <p>After this I selected a different set of polygons as shown in <b>Tile #03</b>,\
      \ and subdivided again.</p>\n<p>And one more time with yet another different\
      \ set of polys, as shown in <b>Tile #04</b>.</p>\n<p>Everything seemed to be\
      \ going great, I wanted one more level of subdividing, but thought I would manipulate\
      \ some vertices a bit more at this point, looking at the top of the steam vent\
      \ I thought it was looking pretty flat, and wanted to put some altitude variation\
      \ into that, after this I selected the polys shown in <b>Tile #05</b> and did\
      \ a final subdivide.</p>\n<p>At this point I noticed that the corners of my\
      \ square had moved in due to the HSDS smoothing modifier, I quickly moved them\
      \ back to their corners at the proper 128,128 -128,128 128,-128 -128,128 positions,\
      \ making sure the outside shape remained a perfect square.</p>\n<p>I was happy\
      \ with model, and later did others to produce varience in game.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ task of skinning came next, I chose to use the vertex paint method for a smooth\
      \ transition from soil to mud, I thought a bit that the terrain itself would,\
      \ atleast where these vents were, be a mix of mud and other textures anyhow,\
      \ and that not a spec of solid soil should be seen, I added the vertexpaint\
      \ modifier.</p>\n<p>A new panel pops up, at its top are a few images of cubes,\
      \ I picked the shaded representation of the vertex colors(the second cube on\
      \ my version). They can be seen in <b>Tile #06</b></p>\n<p>A little bit below\
      \ this, there are 6 more buttons, 3 wide ones on the right, and 3 thin ones\
      \ on the left, the tooltip reads paint on the top right one, and erase below\
      \ that, and finally the color picker below that, I chose to use a black, not\
      \ sure why, it just seemed like the logical choice, we are after all effectivly\
      \ painting an alpha channel that determines the transparency between our two\
      \ textures here. These buttons can be seen in <b>Tile #06</b>.</p>\n<p>I paint\
      \ my pattern onto the mesh, merging the two appropriatly to make a smooth transition\
      \ form the soil ground to the muddy slope and top, I end up with something looking\
      \ the mesh shown in <b>Tile #06</b></p>\n<p>I'm not sure if the next step is\
      \ actually required, since we are only going to be assigning one material to\
      \ the mesh, but I'll quickly go through the process anyhow.</p>\n<p>In the 3DS\
      \ Max material editor, found in the top toolbar, designated by 4 spheres coloured\
      \ red, green, blue and white, select the first material, then click the button\
      \ that has the label Standard and change it to Multi/Sub Object, it will ask\
      \ you if you want to discard or keep the material that used to be in slot you\
      \ have changed, since you need to be taught this, I assume you are new to 3DS\
      \ Max, and I will recomend you discard, but leave the choice for yourself.</p>\n\
      <p>The interface changes dramitcally, click the button labeled Set Number and\
      \ set it too 1, because we will only be using one material, which will actually\
      \ be a mix of two textures&#160;;)</p>\n<p>Down the bottom of the interface\
      \ the long list of textures should shrink to contain only the one, click the\
      \ button which should be labeled something like <i>Material #xx ( Standard )</i>,\
      \ then change the drop down from Blinn to Phong at the top, UT3 uses phong.\
      \ and then in the tiny little square button next to the Diffuse color swatch\
      \ in the Basic Parameters, and select Mix.</p>\n<p>Where it say color #1, go\
      \ to the button labeled none, click it, select bitmap, and then load the soil\
      \ texture (note the color in the swatch is black, it will replace the black\
      \ sections we just painted), and then do the same for color #2 except load the\
      \ mud texture, which should replace the white section of the mesh.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ third one in the list is called Mix Amount, this is the map which determines\
      \ the pattern of the two textures, you <i>could</i> use perlin noise for an\
      \ unpredictable response, but what we want here is the vector color, if you\
      \ click the square button, you should see Vertex Color about 3rd from the bottom,\
      \ select it, and we are almost done, climb back out of the mix, to the top texture\
      \ in the drop down list, and then apply it to the object (by selecting the object\
      \ and clicking the third button directly below the texture sphere swatches),\
      \ you won't see the texture in the viewport, but it should be there when we\
      \ render.</p>\n<p>There is one last thing to do, and that is add an edit poly\
      \ modifier, select the border of the square from underneath, and cap it with\
      \ the cap button in the roll out. If you see textures fighting after having\
      \ done this, don't feel to worried, the fact that it will be placed slightly\
      \ below ground level will totally cover this problem up when we place them in\
      \ the editor.</p>\n<p>When I rendered my one it look like the one shown in <b>Tile\
      \ #07</b></p>\n<p>I was modestly happy with it, there was room for improvement,\
      \ and I could take that up with my next few variants, but this was satisfactory\
      \ for what I wanted.</p>\n<p>Now I needed to import it into the game...</p>\n\

      \ list is called Mix Amount, this is the map which determines the pattern of\
      \ the two textures, you ''could'' use perlin noise for an unpredictable response,\
      \ but what we want here is the vector color, if you click the square button,\
      \ you should see Vertex Color about 3rd from the bottom, select it, and we are\
      \ almost done, climb back out of the mix, to the top texture in the drop down\
      \ list, and then apply it to the object (by selecting the object and clicking\
      \ the third button directly below the texture sphere swatches), you won't see\
      \ the texture in the viewport, but it should be there when we render.\n\nThere\
      \ is one last thing to do, and that is add an edit poly modifier, select the\
      \ border of the square from underneath, and cap it with the cap button in the\
      \ roll out. If you see textures fighting after having done this, don't feel\
      \ to worried, the fact that it will be placed slightly below ground level will\
      \ totally cover this problem up when we place them in the editor.\n\nWhen I\
      \ rendered my one it look like the one shown in '''Tile #07'''\n\nI was modestly\
      \ happy with it, there was room for improvement, and I could take that up with\
      \ my next few variants, but this was satisfactory for what I wanted.\n\nNow\
      \ I needed to import it into the game...\n\n===Navigation===\n\n====Table of\
