      <p>Oversimplified, a ragdoll is the object used when a player dies in UT2003\
      \ or UT2004. On screen it is characterised by its floppy movements which are\
      \ dictated by world forces rather than by a specific animation sequence. This\
      \ is the part of the Karma engine that most players associate with the term\
      \ \"Karma\".</p>\n<p>More correctly, a ragdoll is an instance of <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\">actor</a> with <a href=\"/Legacy:PhysicsType\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:PhysicsType\">PhysicsType</a> set to PHYS_KarmaRagdoll.</p>\n\
      <p>In UnrealEngine2, a Karma \"ragdoll\" is essentially a number of <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Static_Mesh\" title=\"Legacy:Static Mesh\">static meshes</a> joined\
      \ together by KBSJoints. (See <a href=\"/Legacy:Karma\" title=\"Legacy:Karma\"\
      >Karma</a>]). They are integrated into a single object and when set to the PHYS_KarmaRagdoll\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:PhysicsType\" title=\"Legacy:PhysicsType\">PhysicsType</a>\
      \ they will act as that cluster of meshes and constraints along with gravity\
      \ and any external impulses. Note, however, that the renderer still renders\
      \ this as a skeletal mesh, and uses the static mesh collision only for the Karma\
      \ simulation.</p>\n<p>In UnrealEngine 2.5, skeletal meshes can have their own\
      \ collision hulls, so their own collision is used for the simulation.</p>\n\

      <p>By far the most common use is for the \"ragdoll deaths\" of UT2003 and UT2004.\
      \ When a <a href=\"/Legacy:Pawn\" title=\"Legacy:Pawn\">pawn</a> is killed,\
      \ it is turned into a <strong class=\"selflink\">Karma ragdoll</strong> version\
      \ of the original pawn. It is still the same class, but its physics have changed\
      \ drastically. The ragdoll then flops and slides around, dying in a relatively\
      \ realistic manner.</p>\n<p>Karma RagDolls behave in all respects like static\
      \ meshes joined by KBSJoints. As far as we know, though their only use in the\
      \ built-in classes is for ragdoll deaths, they could be used for other applications\
      \ like a rope or some such thing. It's likely but not tested that a Karma Ragdoll\
      \ will simulate faster using less RAM and CPU time than will separate actors\
      \ connected by Karma constraints.</p>\n<p>There has also been cool work done\
