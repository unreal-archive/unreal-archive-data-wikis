      <p>Here, you will gain understanding of the structure of an OOP program. The\
      \ section after this one will introduce you to all the things that it consists\

      \ objective that the program is written for.</p>\n<p>With the knowledge you\
      \ now have its time for you take a look at the <a href=\"/Legacy:Class_Tree\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Class Tree\">Class Tree</a> of the Unreal Engine. See if you\
      \ can find where FlakCannon fits hierarchy and see if that make sense to you.\

      \ title=\"Legacy:Class Tree\">Class Tree</a> and/or click on <a href=\"/Legacy:Weapon\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Weapon\">Weapon</a> so you can see all the code that FlakCannon\
      \ inherits from its parent class. The actual class, FlakCannon, has overridden\
      \ some of that code to make it still a weapon but a unique and specific weapon.\
      \ Try to pick out some of the things you would suspect that FlakCannon overrides\
      \ to make itself unique. Then return here.</p>\n<p>Now you should read <a href=\"\
