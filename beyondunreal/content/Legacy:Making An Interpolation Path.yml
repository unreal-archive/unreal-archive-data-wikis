      \ a triggered path that sends the player to diferrent points in it, in a specific\
      \ order. An interpolation path was used for Unreal Tournament's CityIntro map\
      \ that starts up when you first load UT. Some of the editable variables include\
      \ skipping the next point, speed of the game (this makes cool matrix-like scenes\
      \ possible if you know what you're doing), speed of the camera, etc.</p>\n<p>An\
      \ interpolated curve doesn't actually touch the points at all. It is pulled\
      \ towards the points, but without actually going through them. (It is not the\
      \ same as splining. A spline is a smoothed line that goes through all of the\
      \ points in the path. This is commonly used for smooth paths, but not in Unreal.)</p>\n\

      \ a closed path, 4 for an open path. When any point of the path is selected,\
      \ UnreaEd shows the path as a curved white line, with little axes glyphs at\
      \ intervals. These don't actually mean anything, and they will never rotate.</p>\n\
      <p>First of all, lay out your path. Find Actor &gt;&gt; Keypoint &gt;&gt; <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:InterpolationPoint\" title=\"Legacy:InterpolationPoint\">InterpolationPoint</a>\
      \ in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_Classes_Browser\" title=\"Legacy:Actor Classes\
      \ Browser\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Actor Classes Browser</a>. The camera will\
      \ travel in a straight line from one point to the next, so set your path up\
      \ accordingly.</p>\n<p>Define the order of the points with the InterpolationPoint\
      \ -&gt; Position property. This must be set to 0,1,2... etc.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ No-one mentioned the freaky lines and circle that appears in UEd at this point!\
      \ O_o Or that you need a minimum of 3. And bEndOfPath makes the lines disappear.</p>\n\
      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> And how the heck do you figure out which way the camera\
      \ is actually pointing? I've spent hours trying to figure out how to get my\
      \ <i>InterpolatingSkyZone</i> to actually travel the path I want without any\
      \ crazy rotations but to no avail. It's fine most of the way around and then\
      \ it suddenly goes wacky and spins randomly.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I've just\
      \ got this to work. Doesnt seem any way to take the player <i>off</i> the path\
      \ again. The direction of each IP gives the directio the player will point in,\
      \ but the path glyphs in UEd dont show this. I've just made myself seasick.,,,\
      \ urg</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> No, it doesn't spin randomly. It interpolates\
      \ the angles numerically, so if one of your interpolation points is set to 355°\
      \ and the next to 5° (a 10° difference, you'd think), it'll not rotate 355°\
      ...359°...0°...5° but <i>backwards</i>. To make it behave as you want it to,\
      \ you'd have to set the second InterpolationPoint's rotation to 365° rather\
      \ than 5°.</p>\n<p><b>Neveos:</b> Everything is set correctly on mine (it is\
      \ important that it starts at \"0\", btw, or it crashes at the end), but it\
      \ wants to head back to the first point at the end of the path, before ending.\
      \ It doesn't make it all the way to the beginning before it ends, but it definitely\
      \ is heading to the first point as though it were the last point. Why is this\
      \ happening?</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_dynamics\">The dynamics</span><span\

      <p>The main use of a path is to make the player follow it. This is done with\

      \ the whole process.</p>\n<p>Once you have your path laid out, right click on\
      \ one of the points and select \"Select All Interpolation Point\". Now open\
      \ the actor properties and change their Event Tags to \"Path1\" or, if you'd\
      \ like, a diferrent name of your choice. Just make sure that you use that name\
      \ instead of \"Path1\" wherever we mention it, if you do use something diferrent.</p>\n\
      <p>Now add a regular <a href=\"/Legacy:Trigger\" title=\"Legacy:Trigger\">Trigger</a>\
      \ (Actor &gt;&gt; Triggers &gt;&gt; Trigger) wherever you like – just make sure\
      \ you'll be able to find it. To see it in game, either</p>\n<ul>\n<li>set it\
      \ to display the trigger's sprite in game with Advanced -&gt; bHidden = True</li>\n\
      <li>set it to cast a small circle of light (set Lighting -&gt; LightType and\

      \ anywhere in the map, doesn't matter where), add a <a href=\"/Legacy:SpecialEvent\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:SpecialEvent\">SpecialEvent</a> from the same menu. Change\
      \ its event tag to \"PathStart\", and its Event to \"Path1\". Now open up the\
      \ regular Trigger's properties and change its Event to \"PathStart\".</p>\n\
      <p><b>Flopsy:</b> Just a comment you need to set the Default State of the Special\
      \ Event actor to PlayerPath under Object&gt;&gt;InitialState.</p>\n<h4><span\

      \ and Camera Speed (the actual speed of the camera. This rate of movement depends\
      \ on the value in the game speed property). Note that these are not the actual\
      \ names of the properties - again my memory is foggy. It should, however, be\
      \ pretty obvious. You'll just have to experiment with the values and se what\

      \ game mode, playing it in, say, DM, will show your weapon as you move along\
      \ the path. You probably don't want this, unless you're making some sort of\
      \ ride for the player (in single player for example). In order to make the player\
      \ appear without any HUD or weaponry of any kind, you'll have to set the default\
      \ game type (under level properties) to the appropriate actor. You can find\
      \ these under Info&gt;GameInfo. Again I forget the proper name (sorry about\
      \ all this folks, it's been over a month since I've messed with interpol points),\
      \ but it should have something to do with \"intro\" and will be fairly obvious.\
      \ Finally, you will need a playerstart in any case, of course, and rebuilding\
      \ is just as mandatory as ever. Unless you're doing something special, you'll\
      \ probably just want to start the player hovering in the air over the trigger,\
      \ so that they drop onto upon start, triggering your cutscene.</p>\n<p>Please\
      \ note that interpol points can be rotated just like playerstarts. Whatever\
      \ direction they are facing is the direction the camera will rotate to.</p>\n\

      \ (hereafter called IP's) can be found under <b>Keypoint &gt;&gt; InterpolationPoint</b>\
      \ in the <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor_Classes\" title=\"Legacy:Actor Classes\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\">Actor Classes</a> Browser. The first thing to do is to add one\
      \ to your level where you want the Interpolation path to start. IPs show a directional\
      \ arrow in UnrealEd, which defines (funnily enough) the direction that the actor\
      \ on the path will be pointing. Set their direction with the <a href=\"/Legacy:Brush_Rotate\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Brush Rotate\">Brush Rotate</a> tool or the Movement -&gt;\
      \ Rotation property.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>In InterpolationPoint Properties\
      \ -&gt; InterpolationPoint -&gt; Position, you should put the number that defines\
      \ what point in the path this IP is at. This should start at 0, and I have been\
      \ informed that the upper limit is 127 (thanks to TheMapper for that).</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li>I think the best thing to do, is to first add the IP's to your\
      \ level, in aproximately the right places. Then you can get the path set up\
      \ correctly, before changing the speed.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Once you have\
      \ got all your IP's in, there are two more that you have to put in. At the last\
      \ point, you need to have two IP's. Then, put another one in the same position\
      \ as the first, and give it the next Position after the last one. This is because\
      \ IP paths actually loop, and the only way to get the path to go through a point\
      \ is to put two IP's on top of each other. The reason the highest number IP\
      \ is at the beginning of the path is because the actor following the path will\
      \ start half way between the first and last IP's.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ will travel in a straight line from one point to the next, so set your path\
      \ up accordingly.  \n\nDefine the order of the points with the InterpolationPoint\
      \ -> Position property. This must be set to 0,1,2... etc.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ No-one mentioned the freaky lines and circle that appears in UEd at this point!\
      \ O_o Or that you need a minimum of 3. And bEndOfPath makes the lines disappear.\n\
      \n'''EntropicLqd:'''  And how the heck do you figure out which way the camera\
      \ is actually pointing?  I've spent hours trying to figure out how to get my\
      \ ''InterpolatingSkyZone'' to actually travel the path I want without any crazy\
      \ rotations but to no avail.  It's fine most of the way around and then it suddenly\
      \ goes wacky and spins randomly.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I've just got this to work.\
      \ Doesnt seem any way to take the player ''off'' the path again. The direction\
      \ of each IP gives the directio the player will point in, but the path glyphs\
      \ in UEd dont show this. I've just made myself seasick.,,, urg\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ No, it doesn't spin randomly.  It interpolates the angles numerically, so\
      \ if one of your interpolation points is set to 355° and the next to 5° (a 10°\
      \ difference, you'd think), it'll not rotate 355°...359°...0°...5° but ''backwards''.\
      \  To make it behave as you want it to, you'd have to set the second InterpolationPoint's\
      \ rotation to 365° rather than 5°.\n\n'''Neveos:'''  Everything is set correctly\
      \ on mine (it is important that it starts at \"0\", btw, or it crashes at the\
      \ end), but it wants to head back to the first point at the end of the path,\
      \ before ending.  It doesn't make it all the way to the beginning before it\
      \ ends, but it definitely is heading to the first point as though it were the\
      \ last point.  Why is this happening?\n\n==The dynamics ==\n\nThe main use of\
      \ a path is to make the player follow it. This is done with a [[Legacy:SpecialEvent|SpecialEvent]].\n\
      \n(what about making movers folow paths?)\n\nMatch the following to iniate the\
      \ path\n* SpecialEvent's Events -> Event \n* All the IP's Events -> Tag\n\n\
      '''Question''': How does one set the object which will take the path?\n\nSet\
      \ up a [[Legacy:Trigger|Trigger]] to trigger the SpecialEVent to set off the\
      \ whole process.\n\nOnce you have your path laid out, right click on one of\
      \ the points and select \"Select All Interpolation Point\".  Now open the actor\
      \ properties and change their Event Tags to \"Path1\" or, if you'd like, a diferrent\
      \  name of your choice.  Just make sure that you use that name instead of \"\
      Path1\" wherever we mention it, if you do use something diferrent.\n\nNow add\
      \ a regular [[Legacy:Trigger|Trigger]] (Actor >> Triggers >> Trigger) wherever\
      \ you like &ndash; just make sure you'll be able to find it. To see it in game,\
      \ either\n* set it to display the trigger's sprite in game with Advanced ->\
      \ bHidden = True \n* set it to cast a small circle of light (set Lighting ->\
      \ LightType and LightColor properties)\n\nNow, anywhere you like (it can be\
      \ literally anywhere in the map, doesn't matter where), add a [[Legacy:SpecialEvent|SpecialEvent]]\
      \ from the same menu.  Change its event tag to \"PathStart\", and its Event\
      \ to \"Path1\".  Now open up the regular Trigger's properties and change its\
      \ Event to \"PathStart\".\n\n'''Flopsy:''' Just a comment you need to set the\
      \ Default State of the Special Event actor to PlayerPath under Object>>InitialState.\n\
      \n====Setting up the path's parameters====\n\nIn the properties for each point\
      \ are modifiers for Game Speed (the speed of everything going on, including\
      \ that of the camera - bullets will move slower based on this value, for example)\
      \ and Camera Speed (the actual speed of the camera.  This rate of movement depends\
      \ on the value in the game speed property).  Note that these are not the actual\
      \ names of the properties - again my memory is foggy.  It should, however, be\
      \ pretty obvious.  You'll just have to experiment with the values and se what\
      \ speed works best for you.  Start with low numbers however.\n\n====Finally====\n\
      \nWhile the interpolation path should now work in any game mode, playing it\
      \ in, say, DM, will show your weapon as you move along the path.  You probably\
      \ don't want this, unless you're making some sort of ride for the player (in\
      \ single player for example).  In order to make the player appear without any\
      \ HUD or weaponry of any kind, you'll have to set the default game type (under\
      \ level properties) to the appropriate actor.  You can find these under Info>GameInfo.\
      \  Again I forget the proper name (sorry about all this folks, it's been over\
      \ a month since I've messed with interpol points), but it should have something\
      \ to do with \"intro\" and will be fairly obvious.  Finally, you will need a\
      \ playerstart in any case, of course, and rebuilding is just as mandatory as\
      \ ever.  Unless you're doing something special, you'll probably just want to\
      \ start the player hovering in the air over the trigger, so that they drop onto\
      \ upon start, triggering your cutscene.\n\nPlease note that interpol points\
      \ can be rotated just like playerstarts.  Whatever direction they are facing\
      \ is the direction the camera will rotate to.\n\nIf I missed anything important,\
      \ or if anybody wants to look up what the proper names are, feel free to edit\
      \ it into this page.\n\n''The following pages also have tutorial-style information\
      \ on making paths. Merging those into this might be a good idea:''\n* [[Legacy:UMS/InterpolationTutorial|UMS/InterpolationTutorial]]\n\
      * [[Legacy:InterpolationPoint|InterpolationPoint]]\n\n----\n\ncontent from other\
      \ pages... refactoring & mergine needed.\n\n===Adding Interpolation Points to\
      \ your map ===\n\n# InterpolationPoints (hereafter called IP's) can be found\
      \ under '''Keypoint >> InterpolationPoint''' in the [[Legacy:Actor Classes|Actor\
      \ Classes]] Browser. The first thing to do is to add one to your level where\
      \ you want the Interpolation path to start. IPs show a  directional arrow in\
      \ UnrealEd, which defines (funnily enough) the direction that the actor on the\
      \ path will be pointing. Set their direction with the [[Legacy:Brush Rotate|Brush\
      \ Rotate]] tool or the Movement -> Rotation property.\n\n# In InterpolationPoint\
      \ Properties -> InterpolationPoint -> Position, you should put the number that\
      \ defines what point in the path this IP is at. This should start at 0, and\
      \ I have been informed that the upper limit is 127 (thanks to TheMapper for\
      \ that). \n\n# I think the best thing to do, is to first add the IP's to your\
      \ level, in aproximately the right places. Then you can get the path set up\
      \ correctly, before changing the speed. \n\n# Once you have got all your IP's\
      \ in, there are two more that you have to put in. At the last point, you need\
      \ to have two IP's. Then, put another one in the same position as the first,\
      \ and give it the next Position after the last one. This is because IP paths\
      \ actually loop, and the only way to get the path to go through a point is to\
      \ put two IP's on top of each other. The reason the highest number IP is at\
      \ the beginning of the path is because the actor following the path will start\
      \ half way between the first and last IP's. \n\n===Setting the speed of the\
      \ Interpolation Points===\n\n# Once you have your path correct, you may want\
      \ to play around with the speed. You will find that it looks a lot nicer if\
      \ the speed does vary. Knowing when to vary the speed isn't something that I\
      \ can teach you. \n\n# To change the speed, go to '''InterpolationPoint Properties\
      \ -> InterpolationPoint -> RateModifier'''. Again, it is a matter of trial and\
      \ error to find a series of values which you like. On each IP, the rate will\
      \ be at that point, and it will change between the two points. If you want to\
      \ change the rate very quickly, have two IPs very close to each other with different\
      \ rate values.\n\n# You can, if you want, change the speed of the game with\
      \ the '''GameSpeedModifier''', but this works seperately from '''SetSpeed'''.\
      \ If you do use '''GameSpeedModifier''', then make sure that it is reset back\
      \ to 1 for the end of the IP path. \n\n----\n\n* Note: Most of the content from\
      \ this page is adapted from a tutorial for [[Legacy:UMS|UMS]] that [[Legacy:Hugh|Hugh]]\
      \ wrote, and this section certainly isn't complete - the specifics of how to\
      \ get an actor to actually follow the Interpolation path without using UMS I'm\
      \ not clear on, maybe someone else could help out there &ndash; ''Birelli''\n\
      \nThis tutorial I'm only going to tell you the basic technical things you need\
      \ to do to set up a regular interpolation path.  I'm not expert in this area,\
      \ but I do know how to create one.  Please note that the terminal I am typing\
      \ this up at is not equipped with Ued, so I may not tell you the exact name\
      \ of things.  An interpolation point is actually \"InterpolPoint\" or something\
      \ like that, it should be pretty obvious when you're staring at the Keypoint\
      \ menu.\n\n----\n\n[[:Category:Legacy Tutorial]], [[:Category:Legacy To Do]]:\
