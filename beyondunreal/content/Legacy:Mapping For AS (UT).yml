      <li>When placing <a href=\"/Legacy:PlayerStart\" title=\"Legacy:PlayerStart\"\

      \ through the map. The Events-&gt;Event should be matching in both sets of PlayerStarts\
      \ for both teams, and all the player starts in the two areas to be toggled should\
      \ have the same Events-&gt;Tag. This will switch PlayerStarts for both teams\
      \ to the appropriate area. You do not need to set PlayerStart Oject-&gt;InitialState\
      \ to TriggerToggle, in fact you can not change the intial state of PlayerStarts.\
      \ Just remember that the Playerstarts that are farther into the map should have\
      \ PlayerStart-&gt;bEnabled set to False.&#160;:D There are a couple of otherwise\
      \ excellent maps that have overlooked this. You will find it difficult to defend\
      \ the first four objectives if you are locked behind the fifth... You can put\
      \ triggers on the other side of objectives that once reached are triggered,\
      \ or you can make them the events called by a mover etc... If you use a trigger,\
      \ and don't want the defending team to trigger it, just use a <a href=\"/Legacy:TeamTrigger\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:TeamTrigger\">TeamTrigger</a></li>\n<li>Some kind of a cannon\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/Legacy:DefensePoint\" title=\"Legacy:DefensePoint\"\
      >DefensePoints</a> can be used to tell the bots where to stand for the best\
      \ defense of each objective. If you do not place defense points, bots will stand\
      \ as close as possible to the <a href=\"/Legacy:FortStandard\" title=\"Legacy:FortStandard\"\
      >FortStandard</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here are the properties you will need to adjust\
      \ in the DefensePoint's properties under... yup, DefensePoint:\n<ul>\n<li><i><b>FortTag</b></i>:\
      \ Set this to the Events&gt;Tag of the FortStandard you want the bots to defend.\
      \ You will need to create defense points for each objective. So if there is\
      \ a spot that is suitable for defending multiple objectives, say a sniper perch\
      \ or the like, then you will need to place several DefensePoints with each of\
      \ the different FortTags specified.</li>\n<li><i><b>Priority</b></i>: Applies\
      \ only to the group of defense points belonging to a particular FortStandard,\
      \ and again, \"0\" is the highest priority. You do not need to set this if you\
      \ don't want to. But after playtesting, it might be a good idea to enter values\
      \ for this field.</li>\n<li><i><b>Team</b></i>: Obviously, they will belong\
      \ to the defending team so leave them at the default \"0\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>In order to force bots to take different routes you will need to use\
      \ an <a href=\"/Legacy:AssaultRandomizer\" title=\"Legacy:AssaultRandomizer\"\
      >AssaultRandomizer</a>. This will require some playtesting because the level\
      \ should be fully pathed and all objectives/items etc... should be in place\
      \ before using these actors. Once the level is fully pathed, playtest it a few\
      \ times with one bot, and watch the route it takes to accomplish the mission.\
      \ Where you want him to take a different route, you will place an AssaultRandomizer\
      \ on the shorter path someplace where he can not get around it by addtitional\
      \ path lines. Place this <i><b>after</b></i> the junction you want him to branch\
      \ off at. It simulates the impression that that path is longer than it actually\
      \ is. You will need to trigger this actor and here are a couple ways. I am not\
      \ sure how this works, because there is no initial state variable for this actor.</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Use a regular <a href=\"/Legacy:Trigger\" title=\"Legacy:Trigger\"\
      >trigger</a> set to toggle (So the randomizer is on and off randomly as players\
      \ collide the trigger. could be used to make the bots sneaky?)</li>\n<li>Use\
      \ a <a href=\"/Legacy:Counter\" title=\"Legacy:Counter\">counter</a></li>\n\
      <li>Use a <a href=\"/Legacy:StochasticTrigger\" title=\"Legacy:StochasticTrigger\"\
      >StochasticTrigger</a></li>\n<li>Use a <a href=\"/Legacy:Dispatcher\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Dispatcher\">Dispatcher</a> with the randomizer called twice in outevents,\
      \ and put a suitable outdelay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are probably more ways\
      \ to do this, but I have not tried them. Good luck, and I love assault and am\
      \ always looking for new maps. Once your map is done, be sure to Upload it to\
      \ one of the UT map sites such as Unreal Playground or Nali City. Good luck\
      \ and have fun. .</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span><span\

      \ will switch PlayerStarts for both teams to the appropriate area. You do not\
      \ need to set PlayerStart Oject->InitialState to TriggerToggle, in fact you\
      \ can not change the intial state of PlayerStarts. Just remember that the Playerstarts\
      \ that are farther into the map should have PlayerStart->bEnabled set to False.\
      \ :D There are a couple of otherwise excellent maps that have overlooked this.\
      \ You will find it difficult to defend the first four objectives if you are\
      \ locked behind the fifth... You can put triggers on the other side of objectives\
      \ that once reached are triggered, or you can make them the events called by\
      \ a mover etc... If you use a trigger, and don't want the defending team to\
      \ trigger it, just use a [[Legacy:TeamTrigger|TeamTrigger]]\n*Some kind of a\
      \ cannon would be a good idea to protect spawning players too.\n\n==Pathing\
      \ Assault==\n\n[[Legacy:DefensePoint|DefensePoint]]s can be used to tell the\
      \ bots where to stand for the best defense of each objective. If you do not\
      \ place defense points, bots will stand as close as possible to the [[Legacy:FortStandard|FortStandard]].\
      \ \n*Here are the properties you will need to adjust in the DefensePoint's properties\
      \ under... yup, DefensePoint:\n**'''''FortTag''''': Set this to the Events>Tag\
      \ of the FortStandard you want the bots to defend. You will need to create defense\
      \ points for each objective. So if there is a spot that is suitable for defending\
      \ multiple objectives, say a sniper perch or the like, then you will need to\
      \ place several DefensePoints with each of the different FortTags specified.\n\
      **'''''Priority''''': Applies only to the group of defense points belonging\
      \ to a  particular FortStandard, and again, \"0\" is the highest priority. You\
      \ do not need to set this if you don't want to. But after playtesting, it might\
      \ be a good idea to enter values for this field.\n**'''''Team''''': Obviously,\
      \ they will belong to the defending team so leave them at the default \"0\"\n\
      \nIn order to force bots to take different routes you will need to use an [[Legacy:AssaultRandomizer|AssaultRandomizer]].\
      \ This will require some playtesting because the level should be fully pathed\
      \ and all objectives/items etc... should be in place before using these actors.\
      \ Once the level is fully pathed, playtest it a few times with one bot, and\
      \ watch the route it takes to accomplish the mission. Where you want him to\
      \ take a different route, you will place an AssaultRandomizer on the shorter\
      \ path someplace where he can not get around it by addtitional path lines. Place\
      \ this '''''after''''' the junction you want him to branch off at. It simulates\
      \ the impression that that path is longer than it actually is. You will need\
      \ to trigger this actor and here are a couple ways. I am not sure how this works,\
      \ because there is no initial state variable for this actor. \n\n*Use a regular\
      \ [[Legacy:Trigger|trigger]] set to toggle (So the randomizer is on and off\
      \ randomly as players collide the trigger. could be used to make the bots sneaky?)\n\
      *Use a [[Legacy:Counter|counter]]\n*Use a [[Legacy:StochasticTrigger|StochasticTrigger]]\n\
      *Use a [[Legacy:Dispatcher|Dispatcher]] with the randomizer called twice in\
      \ outevents, and put a suitable outdelay.\n\nThere are probably more ways to\
      \ do this, but I have not tried them. Good luck, and I love assault and am always\
      \ looking for new maps. Once your map is done, be sure to Upload it to one of\
      \ the UT map sites such as Unreal Playground or Nali City. Good luck and have\
      \ fun. .\n\n==Objectives==\n\n===Screenshots and Objective descriptions for\
      \ the HUD:===\n\n'''''You should without fail''''' create screenshots for each\
      \ objective that clearly define where they are, (show more than just a picture\
      \ of a button. Make it so there is some indication of where it is located.)\
      \ and compose some some sort of text to describe how to trigger it, (shoot it\
      \ or touch it?) and why it is an objective.  Telling why adds some atmosphere\
      \ to the map. To do this you will need to place an '''''AssaultInfo''''' actor\
      \ somewhere in the level. Here are the fields you will be concerned with filling\
      \ out:\n*Open the AssaultInfo actor's properties and under AssaultInfo you will\
      \ see:\n**'''''NumObjShots''''': Enter a value here corresponding to the number\
      \ of objectives in your level.\n**'''''ObjDesc''''': is where you will put the\
      \ text that appears in the HUD when you press F3 during an assault game below\
      \ the picture when you see the \"Transmission Follows:\" scroll beneath it.\n\
      **'''''ObjShots''''': This is similar to putting a [[Legacy:Screenshot (UT)|Screenshot\
      \ (UT)]] in your level.\n*Also a message in the center of the screen telling\
      \ players what the next objective is once the previous one is complete is a\
      \ good idea.\n\n==EndGame==\n\nTry and do some kind of a nice ending sequence.\
      \  It's always a joy to see something like a bridge that you were trying to\
      \ blow up collapse ala ''AS-Bridge''\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Mapping\

      \nI don't play Assault.  I loathe it..well the online type.  I only did this\
      \ because somebody started the page but put no text so i figured what the hell.\
      \  This page definitly needs input from an assault player tho, and a mapper\
      \ who has made an assault level.-shadow\n\nIt is important to place grading\
      \ spawn points on very long levels. Monsters and extra Bots confuse things greatly.\
      \ Dynamic lighting is fine, but huge areas of strobing just annoys people right?\
      \ Fort Standards are REALLY IMPORTANT and you must do them well. Big huge levels\
      \ are great fun. -{di3}killboy\n\n'''evil_blue_dude'''More mappers should make\
      \ assault. Its good fun to play and to make.\n\nWhen making assault maps, remember\
      \ to test it for hammer jumping exploits. If you have a gate for example check\
      \ to see if hammer jumpers can get over it. Things like that can be really annoying\
      \ if left unfixed. Skilled hammer jumpers for example can complete AS-Mazon\
      \ relatively quickly if no one's guarding the main gate because of the exposed\
      \ ledge above it. It's not just hammer jumping that can cause problems either.\
      \ Even AS-Dam has it's flaws - you can jump through the window of the tower\
      \ and avoid the first objective and can quite easily complete the second and\
      \ third objectives before the defenders even know what the hell's happening.\
      \ - Slim\n\n'''xX)(Xx'''\n\nAlso, some triggers in Assault maps are affected\
      \ by ZEROPING weapons, the zeroping weapons just can't hit the fortstandards,\
      \ it would be great to know why\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
