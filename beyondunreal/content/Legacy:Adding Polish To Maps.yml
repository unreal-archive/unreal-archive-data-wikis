    text: "<p>This page lists the final details you need to consider adding to a map\
      \ to get the perfectly polished professional look.</p>\n<p>This little section\
      \ is for those people wondering why their maps aren't getting any recognition.\
      \ This is a do's and don'ts list to help you getting started in making 1337\
      \ maps, if your already pretty good at mapping (would DavidM read this anyway?)\
      \ then this section may be of little use to you. (BTW, I have removed the Don'ts\

      <p>Things to consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trim edges of platforms whenever possible,\
      \ it looks a lot cleaner (especially on stairs);</li>\n<li>Never skew brick\
      \ textures... It's not only impossible, you won't even get them aligned properly.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p><b>Legal:</b> False! I use brick textures on rounded corners. True,\
      \ it's a lot of work fitting them properly but to claim it's impossible is not\
      \ correct. For skewed surfaces it's the same thing, at least I can do it, but\
      \ you might get a problem with certain textures.</p>\n<p><b>ViolentFunction:</b>\
      \ I think what he means is that it's physically impossible (in the real world)\
      \ to build a wall out of bricks at a skewed angle, so you shouldn't do it in\
      \ your map because it would be very unrealistic. Notice he mentioned bricks\
      \ only and not simply all wall designs.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I wouldn't say\
      \ that it's impossible either. You could file the bricks to make rounded surfaces\
      \ or cut off parts to have them on diagonals, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Break up large\
      \ flat surfaces with something interesting (a few lights, some girders, a sloping\
      \ wall etc);</li>\n<li>Consider the theme of your map and choose textures and\
      \ structures that match that. Keep the theme consistent throughout the entire\
      \ map. Texture your surfaces appropriately, for example a texture labeled floor\
      \ is for the floor not the walls, it may seem obvious but it is amazing how\
      \ many maps have made mistakes as simple as this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>AeroBLASTER:</b>\
      \ This is not necessarily true, or a mistake. Just because a texture is in the\
      \ floor section of a UTX, it doesn't mean it's not suitable for other usage.\
      \ If it looks good, use it.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I agree. Some of best mappers\
      \ use floor textures on sections of walls, or ceiling textures (that blue-grey\
      \ griod ceiling from one of the UTTechs is good for pieces of wall). Pillars\
      \ are trim are often interchangeable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lighting shouldn't be used\
      \ just for making your level visible, use it to your advantage. Because UT only\
      \ has a limited Polygon count it is difficult to make a really beautiful looking\
      \ level. Using a healthy mix of lighting and shadows will add lots of atmosphere\
      \ to your level.</li>\n<li>Seek advice from your peers on how to improve your\
      \ map. It can be a little ego denting sometimes but in the long run it is very\
      \ beneficial to you as a mapper.</li>\n<li>Use masked textures to create grates\
      \ and such to see your opponents through platforms to better the effect of your\
      \ level.</li>\n<li>Arches over doorways (or door frames) make them look good\
      \ and give you a place to stick an overhead light. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Making_Arches\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Making Arches\">Making Arches</a>.</li>\n<li>Use ambient sounds!\
      \ Put them anywhere you can. It adds an amazing amount of atmosphere to the\
      \ map if you can hear that fan blowing, that water dripping, or the wind blasting\
      \ over your hilltops.</li>\n<li>Assign environmental sound effects to your map\
      \ using ZoneSounds. UT200X supports EAX environmental sound technology which\
      \ is utilized in the ZoneSounds portion of your ZoneInfo. Just select a setting\
      \ that closely matches what that particular zone of your level would be like\
      \ (Arena, Stadium, StoneCorridor, WoodenRoom, etc) and click Add. that's all!\
      \ The engine does the rest! It takes 5 seconds and it greatly enhances the sound\
      \ for those with EAX enabled!! All Creative cards starting with the Audigy support\
      \ EAX and many non-Creative cards also support it. Even some AC97-audio cards\
      \ have software support for EAX! It takes no time at all, has ZERO impact on\
      \ performance because it's dependent entirely on the sound card hardware (except\
      \ when using software-EAX), and it has ZERO effect on people who don't have\
      \ EAX enabled.</li>\n<li>Don't over or under scale your map. A good rule to\
      \ follow is not to make anything more than 256 units higher than the closest\
      \ lower level. Always keep in mind that the only weapon that can effectively\
      \ hit things at a range of over 512 units it the sniper rifle, and then pretty\
      \ much only from above. Try to make your hallways narrow enough to where people\
      \ don't have too much trouble hitting their opponents, but wide enough to leave\
      \ some room for strafing. Avoid edges that jut out, effectively making the room\
      \ smaller than it need be. See <a href=\"/Legacy:General_Scale_And_Dimensions\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:General Scale And Dimensions\">General Scale And Dimensions</a>.</li>\n\
      <li>Nothing should be plain. Detail everything with architecture, and if your\
      \ poly counts get too high, use shadows to hide flat, plain surfaces.</li>\n\
      <li>When making symmetrical maps you may have some bsp holes in the game but\
      \ you cannot see them or find them in the editor. To combat this problem you\
      \ should put different textures on the walls of each direction to point you\
      \ in the right direction in the editor. Then when it's all fixed just texture\
      \ it the good way</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Tarquin:</b> I'm a bit baffled by\
      \ that. How does applying textures work? Try Zone/Portal view, BSP holes will\
      \ show up very clearly.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>EternalEpoch:</b> I assume\
      \ he means if you find a BSP error in game while play testing but can't find\
      \ it in the editor, you texture as above so you can find the BSP error easier\
      \ by following the textures. Cos some BSP errors only show up from certain angles\
      \ etc.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>It's well worth examining as many other levels as you\
      \ can. Try and work out how those areas of a map that are <i>special</i> were\
      \ created. Some of the cool tricks you will see are amazing.</p>\n<h3><span\
