      \ this Wiki or to Wikis in general you ought to read this first, because there\
      \ are differences from what you might be used to. At some Wikis, many forums,\
      \ and many bulletin boards, you need to create a username and password to make\
      \ posts. You use these to log in each time you visit the site. On this Wiki\
      \ you don't need to create a username or a password or even log in. It is optional:\
      \ posting anonymously is fine. You don't even have to have a username to create\
      \ a personal page, but it is very helpful. We highly recommend you read \"Why\
      \ should I have a Username?\" to see why you should consider using one. It just\
      \ makes things easier for everyone.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ have a Username?\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Usernames serve a very important function. They appear in the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Recent_Changes\" title=\"Legacy:Recent Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      >Recent Changes</a> listings when a user updates a page. This lets everyone\
      \ know when a page has been updated and by whom. Do you want to know when an\
      \ author updates his tutorials? Do you want to to know when someone has responded\
      \ to your post or contributed something to one of your pages? Do you want to\
      \ know when a page has been updated with the latest info from recent patches?\
      \ These and many other ways of sorting data are all made much easier by people\
      \ having usernames. Everything is still possible to track down without them,\
      \ but would you rather hunt through dozens of anonymous changes page by page\
      \ or simply consult <a href=\"/Legacy:Recent_Changes\" title=\"Legacy:Recent\
      \ Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Recent Changes</a> to see what is going on?</p>\n\
      <p>Getting or having a username doesn't require an email address or any personal\
      \ information! None of that is even asked for. Usernames are not even used for\
      \ logging in. See \"Roaming IDs\" for more on this.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
