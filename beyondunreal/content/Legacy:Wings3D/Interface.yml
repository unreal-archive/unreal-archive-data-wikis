      \ are attached directly to the item they control. Thus, you need to look for\
      \ the Edit Preferences ([[Image:Legacy_W3D-Buttons-Prefmenu.jpeg|]]) symbol.\
      \ When you click this menu item, it will open a menu to edit those preferences\
      \ (the logo is a seperate menu item from the text part).</p>\n<h4><span class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>New, Open, Save, Save As, Exit - These shouldn't need\
      \ explaining.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Merge - Add another scene into the one you're editing</li>\n\
      <li>Save Selected - Save the file, but drop anything that isn't currently selected</li>\n\
      <li>Save Incrementally - Not a clue. Could be some kind of autosave?</li>\n\
      <li>Revert - You guess it, panic and go back to the last save (goes back to\
      \ when you opened the file, or when you last saved it, whichever is later).</li>\n\
      <li>Import - Open a file of the Nendo, 3D Studio, Adobe Illustrator, Wavefront,\
      \ or Stanford ply types. You'll more than likely be working with 3DS files.</li>\n\
      <li>Export - Save the file as Nendo, 3D Studio, Hash A:M, Wavefront, or VRML.\
      \ You'll more than likely be exporting 3DS files.</li>\n<li>Export Selected\
      \ - Save only the selected objects as any of the Export types except Hash.</li>\n\
      <li>Import Image - I haven't managed this without a crash. Thus I don't know\
      \ <i>how</i> it inserts the image.</li>\n<li>Render - Shows what the shape might\
      \ look like rendered.</li>\n<li>Install Plug-In - Installs a plugin if you have\
      \ one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Edit_Menu\">Edit Menu</span><span\

      <p>Undo and Redo shouldn't need explaining.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undo/Redo - Same\
      \ as undo, except that if the last thing you did was undo an action, this will\
      \ redo that action. Good for toggling back and forth to see how a change looks.</li>\n\
      <li>Repeat and Repeat - The difference between these two is that the first repeat\
      \ will repeat the menu action, but not the action itself. The second will repeat\
      \ both. EXAMPLE: If I have a cube, enter the context menu, then scale it up\
      \ 200%, the first repeat would do everything up to the point of clicking the\
      \ menu item, i.e. it would wait for me to tell it how much to scale again. The\
      \ second repeat would execute the menu choice, and then scale it the exact same\
      \ amount.</li>\n<li>Camera Mode - Opens a subdialog to edit camera preferences:\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Mouse Buttons - How many buttons you want to use for the camera</li>\n\
      <li>Camera Mode - If you are used to the camera in Nendo, Maya, 3DS Max, Blender,\
      \ or MotionBuilder, then you can set W3D's camera to behave the same way here.\
      \ Mirai, I believe, is the author's own style. This tutorial uses Mirai for\
      \ simplicity. (Remember to watch your information bar for button information)</li>\n\
      <li>Pan Speed - Set the speed that the camera moves when adjusting</li>\n<li>Scroll\
      \ Wheel - Set wether your wheel will zoom in and out, and by how much each unit.</li>\n\
      <li>Field of View - The angle in front of you that you can see. 45% is recommended.</li>\n\
      <li>Near/Far Clipping Planes - The near and far distances that objects will\
      \ disappear at.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Font - Choose the size you want the\
      \ screen font to be.</li>\n<li>Preferences, Compatibility, Adv. Prefs, Proxy\
      \ Mode Prefs, UI Prefs, Plugin Prefs - Various settings (See Appendix: Preferences)</li>\n\
      <li>Purge Undo History - Exactly what it sounds like it does. Empties the record\
      \ of what you've done (I recommend saving instead.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><span class=\"\

      \ text at the top left of the window</li>\n<li>View Along - This will move the\
      \ camera to show the object along the X, Y, or Z axis. For example, view along\
      \ X will place the camera on the positive X axis, looking at the object. (-X\
      \ will put it on the other side)</li>\n<li>Align to Selection - Not sure here\

  wikitext:
    text: "==Getting started==\n\nAssumptions:  That you have Wings3D downloaded and\
      \ installed, and that you have at least some basic experience with UnrealEd.\
      \ Other than that, you're allowed to n00b it up here ;)\n\n===Essential Terminology===\n\
      *Scene - The file you have open, or the world you're creating your shape 'in'\n\
      *Element - Any object (a vertex, edge, face, or object) in your scene\n*Face\
      \ - A flat surface of your shape, like a side on a box\n*Edge - The line where\
      \ two faces meet\n*Vertex - The point where two or more edges meet\n\n==The\
      \ Environment==\n\n===Buttons:===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_W3D-Layout-Numbered.jpeg|right|]]\n\
      #Shading button - Toggle wether objects are smooth or flat shaded.\n#Perspective\
      \ button - Toggle between Orthogonal (i.e. schematic/blueprint/architectural)\
      \ and Perspective views.\n#Vertex mode - Allows you to select and edit verticies\
      \ (corners)\n#Edge mode - Allows you to select and edit edges (lines between\
      \ verticies)\n#Face mode - Allows you to select and edit faces (surfaces)\n\
      #Body mode - Allows you to select and edit an entire object at once\n#*Note:\
      \ Clicking a mode button while already in that mode will select adjacent Verticies,\
      \ Faces, or Edges (not bodies)\n#Grid button - Toggle the gray grid on and off,\
      \ note 1 grid unit is equal to 1 uu (UnrealED units), hold \"shift\" while moving\
      \ to snap to the grid\n#Axis button - Toggle the axis labels on and off\n#Information/Status\
      \ bar - This is your best friend. The main purpose of this bar is to tell you\
      \ exactly what your mouse buttons will do. L=left button, M=middle button, R=right\
      \ button. Sometimes other function buttons are listed (generally these act as\
      \ a toggle, not a hold-this-button).\n#Window resizing handle - Just thought\
      \ you may want to know that yes, that's what it is.\n\n===Menus:===\n\nIt's\
      \ important to note that a lot of the preferences are attached directly to the\
      \ item they control. Thus, you need to look for the Edit Preferences ([[Image:Legacy_W3D-Buttons-Prefmenu.jpeg|]])\
      \ symbol. When you click this menu item, it will open a menu to edit those preferences\
      \ (the logo is a seperate menu item from the text part).\n\n====File Menu====\n\
      \nNew, Open, Save, Save As, Exit - These shouldn't need explaining.\n*Merge\
      \ - Add another scene into the one you're editing\n*Save Selected - Save the\
      \ file, but drop anything that isn't currently selected\n*Save Incrementally\
      \ - Not a clue. Could be some kind of autosave?\n*Revert - You guess it, panic\
      \ and go back to the last save (goes back to when you opened the file, or when\
      \ you last saved it, whichever is later).\n*Import - Open a file of the Nendo,\
      \ 3D Studio, Adobe Illustrator, Wavefront, or Stanford ply types. You'll more\
      \ than likely be working with 3DS files.\n*Export - Save the file as Nendo,\
      \ 3D Studio, Hash A:M, Wavefront, or VRML. You'll more than likely be exporting\
      \ 3DS files.\n*Export Selected - Save only the selected objects as any of the\
      \ Export types except Hash.\n*Import Image - I haven't managed this without\
      \ a crash. Thus I don't know ''how'' it inserts the image.\n*Render - Shows\
      \ what the shape might look like rendered.\n*Install Plug-In - Installs a plugin\
      \ if you have one.\n\n====Edit Menu====\n\nUndo and Redo shouldn't need explaining.\n\
      *Undo/Redo - Same as undo, except that if the last thing you did was undo an\
      \ action, this will redo that action. Good for toggling back and forth to see\
      \ how a change looks.\n*Repeat and Repeat - The difference between these two\
      \ is that the first repeat will repeat the menu action, but not the action itself.\
      \ The second will repeat both. EXAMPLE: If I have a cube, enter the context\
      \ menu, then scale it up 200%, the first repeat would do everything up to the\
      \ point of clicking the menu item, i.e. it would wait for me to tell it how\
      \ much to scale again. The second repeat would execute the menu choice, and\
      \ then scale it the exact same amount.\n*Camera Mode - Opens a subdialog to\
      \ edit camera preferences:\n**Mouse Buttons - How many buttons you want to use\
      \ for the camera\n**Camera Mode - If you are used to the camera in Nendo, Maya,\
      \ 3DS Max, Blender, or MotionBuilder, then you can set W3D's camera to behave\
      \ the same way here. Mirai, I believe, is the author's own style. This tutorial\
      \ uses Mirai for simplicity. (Remember to watch your information bar for button\
      \ information)\n**Pan Speed - Set the speed that the camera moves when adjusting\n\
      **Scroll Wheel - Set wether your wheel will zoom in and out, and by how much\
      \ each unit.\n**Field of View - The angle in front of you that you can see.\
      \ 45% is recommended.\n**Near/Far Clipping Planes - The near and far distances\
      \ that objects will disappear at.\n*Font - Choose the size you want the screen\
      \ font to be.\n*Preferences, Compatibility, Adv. Prefs, Proxy Mode Prefs, UI\
      \ Prefs, Plugin Prefs - Various settings (See Appendix: Preferences)\n*Purge\
      \ Undo History - Exactly what it sounds like it does. Empties the record of\
      \ what you've done (I recommend saving instead.)\n\n====View Menu====\n*Ground\
      \ Plane, Axes - Same thing as buttons 7 and 8\n*Workmode - Same thing as button\
      \ 1\n*Wireframe - View selected objects as wireframes (or view everything as\
      \ wireframe, if nothing is selected)\n*Shade - Toggle shading on/off for selected\
      \ objects (or everything if nothing selected)\n*Toggle Proxy Mode - Swaps selected\
      \ objects out for a 'proxy', or kind of a stand-in shape for quick rendering?\
      \ (not sure on this one)\n*Quick Smoothed preview - Same as Toggle Proxy, but\
      \ works on ALL objects.\n*Show Saved BB - \"Display any saved Bounding Box\"\
      \n*Show Edges - Show edges in views other than wireframe (can be very useful\
      \ if you need to see face boundaries)\n*Show Wireframe Backfaces - Show parts\
      \ of a wireframe that would normally be hidden from view by the rest of the\
      \ shape\n*Show Normals - Not sure what this one does. Someone help meeeeeee!!!\
      \ =P\n*Reset View - Resets to the normal position for the camera to be in\n\
      *Aim - Point the camera at the selected objects\n*Frame - Move to show ALL selected\
      \ objects\n*Orthographic View - Same as button 2\n*Scene Lights - Render using\
      \ lights defined in the scene\n*Two Lights - Render using two default 'work'\
      \ lights\n*Show Colors - Render in color\n*Show Materials - Render with shinyness,\
      \ opacity, etc\n*Show Textures - Render with texture mapping (Don't know if\
      \ this is supported)\n*Show Info Text - Show the informational text at the top\
      \ left of the window\n*View Along - This will move the camera to show the object\
      \ along the X, Y, or Z axis. For example, view along X will place the camera\
      \ on the positive X axis, looking at the object. (-X will put it on the other\
      \ side)\n*Align to Selection - Not sure here either\n*Auto Rotate - Sets the\
      \ camera rotating on its own.\n\n====Select Menu====\n\nDeselect, Adjacent,\
      \ Inverse are all the same as in UnrealEd\n*More - Select faces adjacent to\
      \ a selected face\n*Less - Deselect faces adjacent to an unselected face\n*Similar\
      \ - Select similar faces\n*Edge Loop >\n**Edge Loop - Select the edges of the\
      \ selected face.\n**Edge Loop to Region - Select faces defined by the selected\
      \ edge loop (must have an edge loop selected)\n**Edge Ring - From what I can\
      \ tell, this selects all parallel edges on the same object\n**Previous/Next\
      \ Edge Loop - Selects the previous or next edge loop on the same plane?\n**Grow/Shrink\
      \ Edge Loop - Same thing as More or Less, but you're operating on the edge loop\
      \ of the faces, not the faces themselves.\n**Grow/Shrink Edge Ring - Possibly\
      \ adds/subtracts one more parallel edge to/from your edge ring? Not sure.\n\
      *By - Basically a select by query tool. For example, select ALL Hard Edges,\
      \ ALL Isolated Verticies, etc. Mainly used for debugging/cleaning up.\n*Lights\
      \ - Select all lights\n*All Edges - Select all edges\n*Inverse - Select everything\
      \ that's not selected, and deselect everything that is selected.\n*Hide (Un)selected\
      \ - Hide everything that is(n't) selected\n*Lock Unselected - Prevent changes\
      \ to anything not selected\n*Show/Unlock all - Show/Allow changes to everything\n\
      *Store Selection - Save your selection so you can get it back\n*Recall Selection\
      \ - Get your saved selection back\n*New Group - Create a group of elements\n\
      \n====Tools menu====\n*Align - Not too sure yet...\n*Center - Center the selected\
      \ element(s) on the selected axis.\n*Save Bounding Box - Save the bounding box\
      \ of the selected object.\n*Scale to saved BB (proportionally) - Scale the object\
      \ to fit its bounding box\n*Move to saved BB - Move the object to share a center\
      \ with its bounding box\n\nNote that all the above (except save BB) can be done\
      \ on any axis, or all 3)\n*Set default axis - When clicked, this activates a\
      \ special selection mode. When you click a face, edge, or vertex, this will\
      \ set the default axis that changes to the object will follow. (Verticies give\
      \ the line vom the object center to the vertex, faces give the line from the\
      \ center of the object to the center of the face, edges give a ling along the\
      \ edge itself.\n*Virtual Mirror:\n**Create - Show what it would look like if\
      \ the current geometry was mirrored in a face (select 1 face per object you\
      \ want to mirror)\n**Break - Stop mirroring for ALL objects\n**Freeze - Create\
      \ real geometry where the virtual mirror shows it would be\n*Snap image - Works\
      \ with Import image somehow\n*Tweak - VERY freeform vertex/edge/face editing\
      \ mode\n\n====Window menu====\n*Outliner - Shows all the parts of your scene\
      \ as a list\n*Geometry Graph - Shows list of objects, and options to hide/lock/wireframe\
      \ them\n*New Geometry Window - Opens another view of your scene\n\n====Help\
      \ menu====\n\nGo here to get help. No, I'm not going to tell you how :p\n\n\
      ==Related links==\n\n[[Legacy:Wings3D/First Shape|Wings3D/First Shape]] - Next\
      \ part of the tutorial (Under Construction)\n\n[[Legacy:Wings3D/Getting Started|Wings3D/Getting\
      \ Started]] - Back where you came here from\n\n''This page thrown in your general\
      \ direction by [[Legacy:DUc0N|DUc0N]]''\n\n==Comments==\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Please\
      \ replace this image <nowiki>[numbered layout shot]</nowiki> with a PNG. It\
      \ will probably be smaller.\n\n'''dUc0N:''' I tried it, and the PNG was over\
      \ 200K where the JPG was only 51K. I replaced it with a scaled-back version\
      \ of the JPG. :)\n\n'''Ironblayde:''' That's surprising... did you take a screenshot\
      \ and save it directly to PNG (good), or did you try to convert the existing\
      \ JPG to PNG (bad)?"
