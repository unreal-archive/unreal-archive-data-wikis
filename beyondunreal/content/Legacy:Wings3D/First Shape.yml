      \ title=\"Edit section: Assumptions:\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>You are at least mildly familiar with UnrealEd, and\
      \ either you've read over <a href=\"/Legacy:Wings3D/Interface\" title=\"Legacy:Wings3D/Interface\"\
      >Wings3D/Interface</a>, or you want to Wing it (;)) and figure out the controls\
      \ as you go (most are pretty easy). You should also know what Verticies, Edges,\
      \ and Faces are. <i>IMPORTANT:</i> I also assume you have a 3 button mouse.\
      \ If this is not the case, you will need to change your settings in Edit -&gt;\
      \ Preferences under the Camera tab. The buttons and what they do are almost\
      \ always in the information bar, so make the necessary mental adjustments as\
      \ needed.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives:\">Objectives:</span><span\

      <p>By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to do the following:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Plan your shape for inclusion into a UT2003 map</li>\n<li>Create a\
      \ shape in Wings3D</li>\n<li>Scale, rotate, and position the shape</li>\n<li>Change\
      \ the shape of the shape by editing Verticies, Edges, and Faces</li>\n<li>Assign\
      \ a color/material to the shape</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>If you haven't already, download, install, and run\
      \ Wings 3D. You'll get a window that has a single viewport in it, a grey grid,\
      \ and axes markers. Maximize that window if you like, and you can enlarge the\
      \ viewport as well (or add new ones with Window &gt; New Geometry Window).</p>\n\

      \ section: Manipulating the camera\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>If you're already used to using Nendo, Maya, 3DS Max,\
      \ Blender, or MotionBuilder, then you can go to Edit -&gt; Preferences and under\
      \ the Camera tab change the camera controls to be the same as any of those programs\
      \ (watch the Information Bar as needed for buttons and what they do). If not,\
      \ you may wish to use the defualt – Mirai. It's somewhat hard to get used to\
      \ after UnrealEd, but has a shallow learning curve. This tutorial will use the\
      \ default (Mirai) camera mode.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Operating_the_camera_in_Mirai_mode\"\
      >Operating the camera in Mirai mode</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=5\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Operating the camera in Mirai mode\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>A quick rundown of how the\
      \ Marai camera works: From the normal screen, click the middle mouse button\
      \ to open the camera mode. From here, the mouse cursor disappears, and moving\
      \ the mouse pans the camera around the focus (in this case, we're focused on\
      \ the origin, or x=0, y=0, z=0). Holding the middle mouse button down while\
      \ moving the mouse, OR using your mousewheel will zoom in and out. Pressing\
      \ 'Q' will change from 'tumble mode' (focus remains in one spot) and 'track\
      \ mode', where moving the mouse will make the camera 'strafe' up, down, left,\
      \ and right instead of turning. In camera mode, click the left button to stop\
      \ moving the camera and continue editing, or click the right mouse button to\
      \ cancel your changes and put the camera back where it was.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
      mw-headline\" id=\"Making_a_new_shape\">Making a new shape</span><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=6\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Making a new shape\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>To add a new shape to the scene, just right-click\
      \ anywhere in the scene to open the context menu. As you can see, you can add\
      \ lots of different shapes from here. The shapes at the top are sphericals (i.e.\
      \ they attempt to mimic a sphere, but with flat surfaces), and they have 4,\
      \ 8, 26, 12, and 20 faces respectively. For this tutorial however, we'll be\
      \ using a plain old cube (6 sides). Click cube, and a 2x2x2 cub will appear\
      \ at the origin. This is the default spawning point for all shapes in Wings3D.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Scale_the_shape\">Scale the shape</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=7\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Scale the shape\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Notice that there is no option to resize the grid in Wings3D. This is because\
      \ W3D operates on a 1 unit grid, and each unit here is the same as 1 unit in\
      \ UnrealEd. This makes the default 2x2x2 cube unrealistically small compared\
      \ to your almost 200 unit tall player. We now want to scale it up a bit, to\
      \ allow for that, so make sure you're in 'body selection mode' (the fourth pyramid\
      \ button in the second group), and select your cube. Another helpful thing to\
      \ know is that useful information about the object appears in the upper left\
      \ of the window. Now, right click on the cube, and click Scale. Then click Uniform\
      \ to scale on all three axes at once (you could scale on just a single axis\
      \ at a time if you want, for example to make your object taller but not wider).\
      \ I'll scale mine 800%, to make the new dimensions 16x16x16. Hold shift while\
      \ scaling to snap to the grid. The plan is to make it look nice at a size that\
      \ will fit the grid in the program, and then inflate it to real-world size later.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Resize_the_shape_on_one_axis\">Resize the\
      \ shape on one axis</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=8\" title=\"Edit\
      \ section: Resize the shape on one axis\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Now we're going to make our shape into a simple door.\
      \ Doors are traditionally much thinner than they are wide, so we'll need to\
      \ scale it back a bit. Right-click and then click Scale, then choose either\
      \ the X or Z axis (doesn't really matter). Scaling in Wings3D defaults to using\
      \ the mouse, but this can be very inaccurate for scaling something down, since\
      \ the size at the start is 100%, and the grid snap feature snaps to multiples\
      \ of 100. So, since we want it 1/8th its current size on that axis, we'll enter\
      \ scaling mode, then press Tab to open the numeric entry window. Enter 1/8th\
      \ of 100% or 12.5 here, then press enter. This will scale it back to the exact\
      \ size we want, and exit scaling mode.</p>\n<p>Our door will be narrower than\
      \ it is tall, as well. Following the same procedure, scale it along the other\
      \ axis (x if you used z last time, or z if you used x) down to half its current\
      \ size.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Edit_the_edges\">Edit the\
      \ edges</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=9\" title=\"Edit\
      \ section: Edit the edges\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>Our door should also get narrower at the top than at the bottom. This can\
      \ be a very simple, yet very effective design if used properly. Switch to the\
      \ Edge selection mode (second of the second group of pyramid buttons). Notice\
      \ that when you mouseover an edge, it will light up green now. Click the two\
      \ top side edges, and they will turn red indicating they are selected (select\
      \ the shorter edges, not the longer ones).</p>\n<p>Right click anywhere, then\
      \ click move, and choose the axis that's at a right angle with that edge (but\
      \ not the Y axis). Now you can use either Tab entry, or use Shift to snap to\
      \ the grid, and move that corner of the door. Move it until it's 2 units away\
      \ from the origin, and do the same for the opposite edge on the top.</p>\n<h3><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hide.2C_Move_and_Rotate_shapes\">Hide, Move and\
      \ Rotate shapes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=10\" title=\"Edit\
      \ section: Hide, Move and Rotate shapes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Now we'll get slightly fancier with our door by adding\
      \ a triangle we plan to texture with a logo later to the front of the door.\
      \ Deselect everything by using the Select menu, or clicking everything until\
      \ nothing is red anymore, and right click in the scene. When the menu pops up,\
      \ go to the Cylinder <i>menu</i> by clicking on the preferences icon ([[Image:Legacy_W3D-Buttons-Prefmenu.jpeg|]]),\
      \ then enter 3 for sections and click OK. We've created a triangular shape now,\
      \ but it's too small, and we can't select it because the door is in the way.</p>\n\
      <p>To solve this, we'll hide the door by selecting it, and going to Select &gt;\
      \ Hide Selected in the menus. Next, move the shape out of the way by right-clicking,\
      \ and selecting Move. Now that it's out of the way, we can go to Select &gt;\
      \ Show All in the menu to bring our door back.</p>\n<p>Because we want this\
      \ to be a sign on the door, we'll rotate and scale it. Scale the shape along\
      \ the Y axis to 1/8th its size (12.5%). Our triangular piece is now 0.25 units\
      \ tall. Switch to Body selection mode, and select the triangle, then right click\
      \ and choose Rotate, and whichever axis is parellel to the face of the door\
      \ (except Y). Now we can rotate the shape along this axis. Rotate the shape\
      \ 90 degrees to appear flat against the door, and click to lock in the change.</p>\n\
      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Editing_verticies_and_faces\">Editing verticies\
      \ and faces</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=11\" title=\"Edit\
      \ section: Editing verticies and faces\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>To edit a vertex or face, just pick the appropriate\
      \ selection mode, and select the editing mode for the action you want to perform\
      \ on the element. Keep in mind that changes to one element can affect the others:\
      \ moving a face will move the adjacent edges, and resize and rotate the edges\
      \ and faces adjacent to those.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Using_the_orthographic_view\"\
      >Using the orthographic view</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=12\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Using the orthographic view\">edit</a><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"floatleft\"><a href=\"\
      /File:Legacy_dUc0N-W3Dtutorial2-shape.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy\
      \ dUc0N-W3Dtutorial2-shape.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_dUc0N-W3Dtutorial2-shape.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"356\" height=\"250\" /></a></div>\n<p>Now we want to attach the shape\
      \ to the front of our door. The easiest way to do this is to use an orthographic,\
      \ or schematic view. Click View &gt; Orthographic View in the menus, and then\
      \ View &gt; View Along &gt; Positive Z. We now have a top-down view of our scene\
      \ (+Z places the camera on a point on the positive Z axis). Freemove the shape\
      \ to be centered on the X axis if it's not already, and then place it so it's\
      \ just past touching the door (the two shapes should overlap a little). The\
      \ figure at the left is what my shape looks like now.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
      mw-headline\" id=\"Applying_a_material_to_the_shape\">Applying a material to\
      \ the shape</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Legacy:Wings3D/First_Shape?section=13\" title=\"Edit\
      \ section: Applying a material to the shape\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>To my semi-certain knowledge, there is currently no\
      \ way to texture map a shape in Wings3D. The only way to apply a texture to\
      \ your shape would be to re-edit it with another program, export it as VRML\
      \ and edit the code directly (very difficult), or allow UnrealEd to texture\
      \ it for you when you import it (UEd will inform you that the mesh is untextured\
      \ and apply the currently selected texture to it, which may not look as nice\
      \ as you'd like it to.)</p>\n<p>To make it look pretty anyways, select all the\
      \ faces you want to apply a specific material to ('materials' in Wings3D are\
      \ a set of characteristics that define color, shinyness, etc.), using either\
      \ the Face or Body selection modes. Now, right-click and select Material, then\
      \ enter a name (doesn't reallly matter, unless you want to apply the same material\
      \ later to other faces). The Diffuse and Specular colors are the key ones here,\
      \ and will control the color of the object and the color of the light reflecting\
      \ on it. Ambient color will slightly change the colors of both, and I haven't\
      \ figured out Emission yet.&#160;:p Shinyness changes the size of the reflection,\
      \ and Opacity makes your shape partially see-through. To the left, you can see\
      \ the material I assigned to my shape.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><i>This page spit up\

    text: "This page is a tutorial to guide you through making your very first shape\
      \ in Wings3D.\n\n====Assumptions:====\n\nYou are at least mildly familiar with\
      \ UnrealEd, and either you've read over [[Legacy:Wings3D/Interface|Wings3D/Interface]],\
      \ or you want to Wing it (;)) and figure out the controls as you go (most are\
      \ pretty easy). You should also know what Verticies, Edges, and Faces are. ''IMPORTANT:''\
      \ I also assume you have a 3 button mouse. If this is not the case, you will\
      \ need to change your settings in Edit -> Preferences under the Camera tab.\
      \ The buttons and what they do are almost always in the information bar, so\
      \ make the necessary mental adjustments as needed.\n\n====Objectives:====\n\n\
      By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to do the following:\n*Plan\
      \ your shape for inclusion into a UT2003 map\n*Create a shape in Wings3D\n*Scale,\
      \ rotate, and position the shape\n*Change the shape of the shape by editing\
      \ Verticies, Edges, and Faces\n*Assign a color/material to the shape\n\n==So\
      \ let's get going==\n\nIf you haven't already, download, install, and run Wings\
      \ 3D. You'll get a window that has a single viewport in it, a grey grid, and\
      \ axes markers. Maximize that window if you like, and you can enlarge the viewport\
      \ as well (or add new ones with Window > New Geometry Window).\n\n===Manipulating\
      \ the camera===\n\nIf you're already used to using Nendo, Maya, 3DS Max, Blender,\
      \ or MotionBuilder, then you can go to Edit -> Preferences and under the Camera\
      \ tab change the camera controls to be the same as any of those programs (watch\
      \ the Information Bar as needed for buttons and what they do). If not, you may\
      \ wish to use the defualt &ndash; Mirai. It's somewhat hard to get used to after\
      \ UnrealEd, but has a shallow learning curve. This tutorial will use the default\
      \ (Mirai) camera mode.\n\n====Operating the camera in Mirai mode====\n\nA quick\
      \ rundown of how the Marai camera works: From the normal screen, click the middle\
      \ mouse button to open the camera mode. From here, the mouse cursor disappears,\
      \ and moving the mouse pans the camera around the focus (in this case, we're\
      \ focused on the origin, or x=0, y=0, z=0). Holding the middle mouse button\
      \ down while moving the mouse, OR using your mousewheel will zoom in and out.\
      \ Pressing 'Q' will change from 'tumble mode' (focus remains in one spot) and\
      \ 'track mode', where moving the mouse will make the camera 'strafe' up, down,\
      \ left, and right instead of turning. In camera mode, click the left button\
      \ to stop moving the camera and continue editing, or click the right mouse button\
      \ to cancel your changes and put the camera back where it was.\n\n===Making\
      \ a new shape===\n\nTo add a new shape to the scene, just right-click anywhere\
      \ in the scene to open the context menu. As you can see, you can add lots of\
      \ different shapes from here. The shapes at the top are sphericals (i.e. they\
      \ attempt to mimic a sphere, but with flat surfaces), and they have 4, 8, 26,\
      \ 12, and 20 faces respectively. For this tutorial however, we'll be using a\
      \ plain old cube (6 sides). Click cube, and a 2x2x2 cub will appear at the origin.\
      \ This is the default spawning point for all shapes in Wings3D.\n\n===Scale\
      \ the shape===\n\nNotice that there is no option to resize the grid in Wings3D.\
      \ This is because W3D operates on a 1 unit grid, and each unit here is the same\
      \ as 1 unit in UnrealEd. This makes the default 2x2x2 cube unrealistically small\
      \ compared to your almost 200 unit tall player. We now want to scale it up a\
      \ bit, to allow for that, so make sure you're in 'body selection mode' (the\
      \ fourth pyramid button in the second group), and select your cube. Another\
      \ helpful thing to know is that useful information about the object appears\
      \ in the upper left of the window. Now, right click on the cube, and click Scale.\
      \ Then click Uniform to scale on all three axes at once (you could scale on\
      \ just a single axis at a time if you want, for example to make your object\
      \ taller but not wider). I'll scale mine 800%, to make the new dimensions 16x16x16.\
      \ Hold shift while scaling to snap to the grid. The plan is to make it look\
      \ nice at a size that will fit the grid in the program, and then inflate it\
      \ to real-world size later.\n\n===Resize the shape on one axis===\n\nNow we're\
      \ going to make our shape into a simple door. Doors are traditionally much thinner\
      \ than they are wide, so we'll need to scale it back a bit. Right-click and\
      \ then click Scale, then choose either the X or Z axis (doesn't really matter).\
      \ Scaling in Wings3D defaults to using the mouse, but this can be very inaccurate\
      \ for scaling something down, since the size at the start is 100%, and the grid\
      \ snap feature snaps to multiples of 100. So, since we want it 1/8th its current\
      \ size on that axis, we'll enter scaling mode, then press Tab to open the numeric\
      \ entry window. Enter 1/8th of 100% or 12.5 here, then press enter. This will\
      \ scale it back to the exact size we want, and exit scaling mode.\n\nOur door\
      \ will be narrower than it is tall, as well. Following the same procedure, scale\
      \ it along the other axis (x if you used z last time, or z if you used x) down\
      \ to half its current size.\n\n===Edit the edges===\n\nOur door should also\
      \ get narrower at the top than at the bottom. This can be a very simple, yet\
      \ very effective design if used properly. Switch to the Edge selection mode\
      \ (second of the second group of pyramid buttons). Notice that when you mouseover\
      \ an edge, it will light up green now. Click the two top side edges, and they\
      \ will turn red indicating they are selected (select the shorter edges, not\
      \ the longer ones).\n\nRight click anywhere, then click move, and choose the\
      \ axis that's at a right angle with that edge (but not the Y axis). Now you\
      \ can use either Tab entry, or use Shift to snap to the grid, and move that\
      \ corner of the door. Move it until it's 2 units away from the origin, and do\
      \ the same for the opposite edge on the top.\n\n===Hide, Move and Rotate shapes===\n\
      \nNow we'll get slightly fancier with our door by adding a triangle we plan\
      \ to texture with a logo later to the front of the door. Deselect everything\
      \ by using the Select menu, or clicking everything until nothing is red anymore,\
      \ and right click in the scene. When the menu pops up, go to the Cylinder ''menu''\
      \ by clicking on the preferences icon ([[Image:Legacy_W3D-Buttons-Prefmenu.jpeg|]]),\
      \ then enter 3 for sections and click OK. We've created a triangular shape now,\
      \ but it's too small, and we can't select it because the door is in the way.\n\
      \nTo solve this, we'll hide the door by selecting it, and going to Select >\
      \ Hide Selected in the menus. Next, move the shape out of the way by right-clicking,\
      \ and selecting Move. Now that it's out of the way, we can go to Select > Show\
      \ All in the menu to bring our door back.\n\nBecause we want this to be a sign\
      \ on the door, we'll rotate and scale it. Scale the shape along the Y axis to\
      \ 1/8th its size (12.5%). Our triangular piece is now 0.25 units tall. Switch\
      \ to Body selection mode, and select the triangle, then right click and choose\
      \ Rotate, and whichever axis is parellel to the face of the door (except Y).\
      \ Now we can rotate the shape along this axis. Rotate the shape 90 degrees to\
      \ appear flat against the door, and click to lock in the change.\n\n===Editing\
      \ verticies and faces===\n\nTo edit a vertex or face, just pick the appropriate\
      \ selection mode, and select the editing mode for the action you want to perform\
      \ on the element. Keep in mind that changes to one element can affect the others:\
      \ moving a face will move the adjacent edges, and resize and rotate the edges\
      \ and faces adjacent to those.\n\n===Using the orthographic view===\n\n[[Image:Legacy_dUc0N-W3Dtutorial2-shape.jpeg|left|]]\n\
      \nNow we want to attach the shape to the front of our door. The easiest way\
      \ to do this is to use an orthographic, or schematic view. Click View > Orthographic\
      \ View in the menus, and then View > View Along > Positive Z. We now have a\
      \ top-down view of our scene (+Z places the camera on a point on the positive\
      \ Z axis). Freemove the shape to be centered on the X axis if it's not already,\
      \ and then place it so it's just past touching the door (the two shapes should\
      \ overlap a little). The figure at the left is what my shape looks like now.\n\
      \n===Applying a material to the shape===\n\nTo my semi-certain knowledge, there\
      \ is currently no way to texture map a shape in Wings3D. The only way to apply\
      \ a texture to your shape would be to re-edit it with another program, export\
      \ it as VRML and edit the code directly (very difficult), or allow UnrealEd\
      \ to texture it for you when you import it (UEd will inform you that the mesh\
      \ is untextured and apply the currently selected texture to it, which may not\
      \ look as nice as you'd like it to.)\n\nTo make it look pretty anyways, select\
      \ all the faces you want to apply a specific material to ('materials' in Wings3D\
      \ are a set of characteristics that define color, shinyness, etc.), using either\
      \ the Face or Body selection modes. Now, right-click and select Material, then\
      \ enter a name (doesn't reallly matter, unless you want to apply the same material\
      \ later to other faces). The Diffuse and Specular colors are the key ones here,\
      \ and will control the color of the object and the color of the light reflecting\
      \ on it. Ambient color will slightly change the colors of both, and I haven't\
      \ figured out Emission yet. :p Shinyness changes the size of the reflection,\
      \ and Opacity makes your shape partially see-through. To the left, you can see\
      \ the material I assigned to my shape.\n\n----\n\n<I>This page spit up by [[Legacy:DUc0N|DUc0N]]</i>\n\
