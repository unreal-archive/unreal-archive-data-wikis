      <p>The last patch made available for the Mac was 224b7. As the version number\
      \ suggests, it was still in the beta stage when released. Since the latest (and\
      \ last) Windows patch for Unreal was version 226f, which isn't compatible with\
      \ the 224b Mac patch, as stated previously network play is broken between the\
      \ two platforms. The patch <i>used</i> to be on Beyond Unreal's <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.beyondunreal.com/main/unreal/unrealessential.php\"\
      >Essential Unreal Files</a> page but it apparently no longer is. You can still\

      \ This was never released on the Mac, and unfortunately because it's not actually\
      \ a 'drop-in' modification (it doesn't require the original Unreal to play it),\
      \ it can't run at all on a Mac in the conventional sense. It is possible however,\
      \ to use Unreal Tournament to run the pack instead, using a modification called\
      \ RTNP2UT. The mod is obtainable via Fileplanet, a direct link to which is located\
      \ on dinwitty's <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.planetunreal.com/vortex/\"\

      >this</a> thread on the BuF. Just FYI in case it wasn't obvious enough already;\
      \ in order to play the mission pack, you actually have to own it. The mod only\
      \ contains a few altered .u files to enable play, it doesn't provide you with\
      \ the maps or any other material.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ ported to the Mac, like its predecessor it has had its fair share of problems\
      \ on the platform (probably more so than the Windows version). After the initial\
      \ release of UT for Windows, it was again decided to get some third party porters\
      \ in to do the Mac version. The job of porting it was given to Westlake Interactive...\
      \ Again. The Publisher would also be Macsoft yet again, although at a later\
      \ stage Infograms took over support for the Mac version (seeing as Macsoft was\
      \ a subsidiary of Infograms).</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Patches_2\"\

      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The\
      \ last official patch that was made available (in sync with the Windows version\
      \ of the game) was version 436, which should still be downloadable from BU's\
      \ <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.beyondunreal.com/main/ut/utessential.php\"\
      >Essential UT Files</a> page):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\

      >436 (3.42mb)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Patch 436 squished numerous bugs, and even\
      \ brought in some new ones (as most patches often do). However, there is still\
      \ an extremely annoying sound bug that usually occurs on most Mac systems running\
      \ the classic OS (OS 9.x or below). It won't occur on OS X if you use the preview\
      \ builds, but that's because the music is broken completely in them anyway.</p>\n\
      <p>The intensity of the bug seems to vary depending on the system you use. It\
      \ also seems to vary how quickly it manifests itself. For instance one might\
      \ be able to play the game perfectly for a short period of time without experiencing\
      \ this problem, but it may become apparent after a few Map changes that music\
      \ no longer plays, and sound effects don't seem to play at all, or if they do,\
      \ the wrong sound plays and usually gets echoed to infinity. There is no known\
      \ fix for this problem on Classic, despite what Westlake have said in the past\
      \ about using different versions of the Sound Manager. Support for the game\
      \ was dropped entirely a long time ago, so it won't get fixed officially now.</p>\n\
      <p>The game isn't playable on OS X natively without using a preview build Westlake\
      \ released; the latest being Preview 3 and was far from complete - Westlake\
      \ even said that because they were doing it in their own free time that it might\
      \ never get finished... And low and behold, it didn't. There was talk of a Preview\
      \ 4 some years ago but that never materialized... Shortly thereafter it seemed\
      \ Westlake dropped support for the game completely. In any case Preview 2 can\
      \ be found on <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.fileplanet.com/84424/80000/fileinfo/Unreal-Tournament-Preview-2-%5BMac-OSX%5D\"\
      >Fileplanet</a>, but Preview 3 appears to have disappeared (it does tend to\
      \ float around certain torrent websites).</p>\n<p>Expanding on the OS X side\
      \ of things, Ryan Gordon is (or rather was) attempting to make a Mac 10 update\
      \ as part of <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.utpg.org/\"\
      >UTPG</a>. That apparently got put on the back burner some time ago though,\
      \ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://icculus.org/cgi-bin/finger/finger.pl?user=icculus&amp;date=2005-04-01&amp;time=16-47-15\"\
      >the last mention of it</a> on Icculus was back in 2005). UTPG itself hasn't\
      \ been updated since 2004 either. Maybe one day a UTPG patch for OS X will be\
      \ finished, so keep an eye on <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"\
      http://icculus.org/cgi-bin/finger/finger.pl?user=icculus\">this page</a> just\
      \ in case hell freezes over.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Editing:_Maps_.26_Mods_2\"\

      \ the Mac version of the game. That's because there is no UnrealEd for Mac,\

      \ no <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealScript\" title=\"Legacy:UnrealScript\">UnrealScript</a>\
      \ compiler available, or indeed other less important tools that might have been\
      \ useful such as a UMOD creation tool, even though Westlake had the kindness\
      \ in their heart (/sarcasm) to create a tool to install UMOD files which comes\
      \ with the 436 patch. There was a project called Seppuku that was supposedly\
      \ trying to create a tool for use on the Mac that would support various other\
      \ Unreal Engine based games as well. The project seemingly never got out of\

      \ if you're suffering from it.\n\n===Patches===\n\nThe last patch made available\
      \ for the Mac was 224b7. As the version number suggests, it was still in the\
      \ beta stage when released. Since the latest (and last) Windows patch for Unreal\
      \ was version 226f, which isn't compatible with the 224b Mac patch, as stated\
      \ previously network play is broken between the two platforms. The patch ''used''\
      \ to be on Beyond Unreal's [http://www.beyondunreal.com/main/unreal/unrealessential.php\
      \ Essential Unreal Files] page but it apparently no longer is. You can still\
      \ get the patches (either the full b7 or the full b1 and the update b7) from\
      \ [http://www.fileplanet.com/30554/0/0/0/1/section/Patches Fileplanet] but you\
      \ need an account to download them:\n\n*[http://www.fileplanet.com/81655/80000/fileinfo/Beta-7-Full-(Mac)\
      \ 224b7 Full (31.6mb)]\n\n===Return to Na Pali===\n\nRTNP is the Digital Extremes\
      \ 'mission pack' for Unreal. This was never released on the Mac, and unfortunately\
      \ because it's not actually a 'drop-in' modification (it doesn't require the\
      \ original Unreal to play it), it can't run at all on a Mac in the conventional\
      \ sense. It is possible however, to use Unreal Tournament to run the pack instead,\
      \ using a modification called RTNP2UT. The mod is obtainable via Fileplanet,\
      \ a direct link to which is located on dinwitty's [http://www.planetunreal.com/vortex/\
      \ web site]. If you go through the ordeal to download it you might also want\
      \ to look at [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=93896 this] thread\
      \ on the BuF. Just FYI in case it wasn't obvious enough already; in order to\
      \ play the mission pack, you actually have to own it. The mod only contains\
      \ a few altered .u files to enable play, it doesn't provide you with the maps\
      \ or any other material.\n\n===Editing: Maps & Mods===\n\nNo UnrealED or UScript\
      \ compiler was released for the Mac so mapping and modding isn't possible on\
      \ the platform.\n\n==Unreal Tournament==\n\nAlthough ported to the Mac, like\
      \ its predecessor it has had its fair share of problems on the platform (probably\
      \ more so than the Windows version). After the initial release of UT for Windows,\
      \ it was again decided to get some third party porters in to do the Mac version.\
      \ The job of porting it was given to Westlake Interactive... Again. The Publisher\
      \ would also be Macsoft yet again, although at a later stage Infograms took\
      \ over support for the Mac version (seeing as Macsoft was a subsidiary of Infograms).\n\
      \n===Patches ===\n\nThe last official patch that was made available (in sync\
      \ with the Windows version of the game) was version 436, which should still\
      \ be downloadable from BU's [http://www.beyondunreal.com/main/ut/utessential.php\
      \ Essential UT Files] page):\n\n*[http://download.beyondunreal.com/fileworks.php/official/ut/ut436update.sit\
      \ 436 (3.42mb)]\n\nPatch 436 squished numerous bugs, and even brought in some\
      \ new ones (as most patches often do). However, there is still an extremely\
      \ annoying sound bug that usually occurs on most Mac systems running the classic\
      \ OS (OS 9.x or below). It won't occur on OS X if you use the preview builds,\
      \ but that's because the music is broken completely in them anyway.\n\nThe intensity\
      \ of the bug seems to vary depending on the system you use. It also seems to\
      \ vary how quickly it manifests itself. For instance one might be able to play\
      \ the game perfectly for a short period of time without experiencing this problem,\
      \ but it may become apparent after a few Map changes that music no longer plays,\
      \ and sound effects don't seem to play at all, or if they do, the wrong sound\
      \ plays and usually gets echoed to infinity. There is no known fix for this\
      \ problem on Classic, despite what Westlake have said in the past about using\
      \ different versions of the Sound Manager. Support for the game was dropped\
      \ entirely a long time ago, so it won't get fixed officially now.\n\nThe game\
      \ isn't playable on OS X natively without using a preview build Westlake released;\
      \ the latest being Preview 3 and was far from complete - Westlake even said\
      \ that because they were doing it in their own free time that it might never\
      \ get finished... And low and behold, it didn't. There was talk of a Preview\
      \ 4 some years ago but that never materialized... Shortly thereafter it seemed\
      \ Westlake dropped support for the game completely. In any case Preview 2 can\
      \ be found on [http://www.fileplanet.com/84424/80000/fileinfo/Unreal-Tournament-Preview-2-%5BMac-OSX%5D\
      \ Fileplanet], but Preview 3 appears to have disappeared (it does tend to float\
      \ around certain torrent websites). \n\nExpanding on the OS X side of things,\
      \ Ryan Gordon is (or rather was) attempting to make a Mac 10 update as part\
      \ of [http://www.utpg.org/ UTPG]. That apparently got put on the back burner\
      \ some time ago though, ([http://icculus.org/cgi-bin/finger/finger.pl?user=icculus&date=2005-04-01&time=16-47-15\
      \ the last mention of it] on Icculus was back in 2005). UTPG itself hasn't been\
      \ updated since 2004 either. Maybe one day a UTPG patch for OS X will be finished,\
      \ so keep an eye on [http://icculus.org/cgi-bin/finger/finger.pl?user=icculus\
      \ this page] just in case hell freezes over.\n\n===Editing: Maps & Mods===\n\
      \nIt is not possible to make Maps or Mods if you have the Mac version of the\
      \ game. That's because there is no UnrealEd for Mac, as nearly all Mac users\
      \ who play UT are probably well aware of. There is also no [[Legacy:UnrealScript|UnrealScript]]\
      \ compiler available, or indeed other less important tools that might have been\
      \ useful such as a UMOD creation tool, even though Westlake had the kindness\
      \ in their heart (/sarcasm) to create a tool to install UMOD files which comes\
      \ with the 436 patch. There was a project called Seppuku that was supposedly\
      \ trying to create a tool for use on the Mac that would support various other\
      \ Unreal Engine based games as well. The project seemingly never got out of\
      \ the idea stage though.\n\n==UT 2003 & 2004==\n\nBoth were released for the\
      \ Mac. Not by Westlake either (hurray!). Patching was kept up to date with the\
      \ Windows version like UT except no \"show stoppers\" were seemingly introduced\
      \ (or indeed went unfixed) as was the case with UT.\n\n===Patches===\n\nThe\
      \ latest patches for the two games are available from Macgamefiles:\n\n*[http://www.macgamefiles.com/detail.php?item=17882\
      \ UT2003 2225.2 (7mb)]\n*[http://www.macgamefiles.com/detail.php?item=18155\
      \ UT2004 3369-2 (200mb)]\n\n==Unreal Tournament 3==\n\nCurrently the Mac version\
      \ of UT3 remains unreleased, but supposedly work is continuing on it and it\
      \ should see a release soon along with a Linux version. The exact reasons for\
      \ why it has been delayed for such a long time have not been disclosed, though\
      \ it is believed to be something to do with a lot of \"red tape\".\n\n===Editing:\
      \ Maps & Mods===\n\nI'm not too familiar with the current situation behind UnrealEd\
      \ on the Mac this time round though going on what was mentioned [http://beyondunreal.com/daedalus/singlepost.php?id=6277\
      \ here] it is a very good possibility it will finally see a release.\n\nFor\
      \ UnrealScript editing there is an application for Mac OS X called Unreal Writer\n\
      \n==Other Games==\n\nThere have been numerous other non-Unreal games released\
      \ on the Mac that use the [[Legacy:Unreal Engine|Unreal Engine]]. Details of\
      \ exactly what games have been released can be found on the [[Legacy:Unreal\
      \ Engine Versions|Unreal Engine Versions]] page, although as for which got Mac\
      \ releases, some of the more popular titles include Deus Ex, Rune, Undying and\
      \ even the newer XIII, and even Postal 2. None have a Mac version of the map\
      \ editor available... There's a surprise."
