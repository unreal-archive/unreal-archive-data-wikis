      <p>This mod was originally a multi-team CTF mod which later included support\
      \ for a single flag mode. Teams are selected based upon the number of <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:FlagBase\" title=\"Legacy:FlagBase\">FlagBase</a> objects on the map\
      \ so maps with two, three, and four teams could be used within the same map\
      \ rotation. The mod contains support for up to four <a href=\"/Legacy:FlagBase\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:FlagBase\">FlagBases</a>, and multiple flags of the same colour.\
      \ There are other options but I forget what they are now and I'm pretty certain\
      \ that the later revisions of both CTF4 and MCTF contained all of the CTF+ features\

      <p>This mod started out as a Last Team Standing variant of CTF with support\
      \ for 4 teams. As far as I know this is the only one of the three mods that\
      \ has support for additional events and triggers. The mod has a somewhat odd\
      \ extra-time feature, support for one flag mode, and a massive number of variations\

      <p>This mod started out as purely a mutli-team CTF mod with the ability to set\
      \ the number of teams, with any flags without an owning team being removed from\
      \ the game. It now supports a host of other features (like Last Team Standing\
      \ etc). CTF4 also has a large variety of scoring systems including combinations\
      \ of certain systems.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Multi-Team_Mapping\"\

      <p>Apart from the additional <a href=\"/Legacy:FlagBase\" title=\"Legacy:FlagBase\"\
      >FlagBases</a> on the map multi-team CTF is mapped in a very similar way to\
      \ CTF. As far as I know CTF4 is the only one of the three mods that implements\
      \ proper alternate pathing. Rather than set the <a href=\"/Legacy:AlternatePath\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:AlternatePath\">AlternatePath</a> Team property to the \"owning\
      \ team\" it should be set to the team that the <a href=\"/Legacy:AlternatePath\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:AlternatePath\">AlternatePath</a> travels to.</p>\n<p>The Team\
      \ property of <a href=\"/Legacy:FlagBase\" title=\"Legacy:FlagBase\">FlagBase</a>\
      \ objects on the map should be set as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0 - Red</li>\n\
      <li>1 - Blue</li>\n<li>2 - Green</li>\n<li>3 - Gold</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should\

      <li>CTFM - The map contains events and triggers specific to MCTF, and has two,\
      \ three, or four flag bases, although four is encouraged.</li>\n<li>CTF3 - The\
      \ map contains no MCTF specific map features and has three flag bases.</li>\n\
      <li>CTF4 - The map contains no MCTF specific map features and has four flag\
      \ bases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>^ that should be made alot clearer.</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>How's\
      \ that? Not sure what you need adding. – <a href=\"/Legacy:EntropicLqd\" title=\"\
      Legacy:EntropicLqd\">EntropicLqd</a>\n<dl>\n<dd><i>I suppose that does it. The\

      \ —<a href=\"/Legacy:Mychaeel\" title=\"Legacy:Mychaeel\">Mychaeel</a></i></dd>\n\
      <dd><b>Birelli:</b> Actually, CTFM maps can have any number of bases, as long\
      \ as there is more than one (i.e. \"multiple\" flag bases). Check out Spoon's\
      \ CTFM-Obsession for an example of a CTFM map that has three teams. MCTF has\
      \ full support for different numbers of teams, and does have extra-time (it's\
      \ just a tad odd because of the reverse-scoring method that MCTF has (you get\
      \ a point for being scored on, so when there is only one team remaining with\
      \ the least number of points they win). – I'm changing stuff above to reflect\
      \ what I just said here.</dd>\n<dd><b>EntropicLqd:</b> That's fine. I wrote\
      \ the MCTF and CTF4 stuff from memory based upon my last experiences with it.\
      \ Both mods have obviously moved on. Ironically, it was these mods that really\
      \ hammered home the point that more configurable features are not necessarily\
      \ better. Although (possibly) more fun for the single home user – it reduces\
      \ the chance of a server being started. I'll get around to removing this discussion\
      \ at some point.</dd>\n<dd><b>Birelli:</b> Yeah, I agree. More than the competition\
      \ between the mods, the fact that both mods have competed agressively to have\
      \ more features, more options, more replayability in botmatches has made this\
      \ entire concept go down the drains with, as far as I know, 0 players online\
      \ at any one point. It'd be nice to see one combined mod in UT2003. The problem\
      \ is that there are serious differences in these mods. CTF4 is very offense-oriented,\
      \ you must cap to win. MultiCTF is extremely defense-oriented, you can win having\
      \ never seen more than the corridors leading off of your flag room and never\
      \ seeing another player, for that matter, although as you defend better other\
      \ teams' bots tend to attack you more.</dd>\n<dd><b>EntropicLqd:</b> One of\
      \ the biggest factors for me freezing the development of the CTF+ mod was the\
      \ fact that there were other multi-team CTF mods and the community really didn't\
      \ need an additional one. It was a sad decision to make, but as I mention elsewhere,\
      \ you need a lot of players to make 4 team CTF viable. Three team works better\
      \ but it was the single flag mode that really worked well - much better than\
      \ I ever though it would in fact.</dd>\n<dd><b>Birelli:</b> Ah, I didn't realize\
      \ you developed CTF+, I come from the perspective of running <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.planetunreal.com/multictf/multilab\"\
      >MultiLab</a> with Ciggie and SpoonDog, we're kind of keeping the shattered\
      \ and virtually non-existent MCTF community alive you could say&#160;;-). I\
      \ love the CTF+ idea of just making as many teams as there are colors of flag\
      \ in the game, Wyzard hasn't done anything in the way of even a map update himself\
      \ since February and I know Excessive was willing to here talk of merging CTF4\
      \ and MCTF, so maybe UT2003 can have one united mod&#160;:-).</dd>\n<dd><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ In terms of merging the CTF4 and MCTF code good luck. We already tried to\
      \ merge the CTF+, MCTF, and CTF4 code bases together but it never happened for\
      \ a variety of reasons - the only visible result of the attempt was David Catmull's\
      \ flag mutator. For UT2003 I'll be doing a single flag CTF mod only, which should\
      \ leave MCTF and CTF4 as the only multi-team CTF mods around. As for the CTF+\
      \ idea of making as many teams as there are flags - you can thank the Germans\
      \ for that. A group of them specifically requested support for 3 team maps,\
      \ and that was the only sensible way to add support for them. Not that they\
      \ ever made any maps. MCTF is more than welcome to <i>steal the code</i> that\
      \ dynamically alters the number of teams (I could probably dig out the specifics\
      \ if you wanted). But hey - maybe a feature for MCTF-UT2003. I can't help thinking\
      \ that there will be less support for multiple teams in UT2003 though.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>I have seen people set the DefaultGameType property\
      \ of the <a href=\"/Legacy:LevelInfo\" title=\"Legacy:LevelInfo\">LevelInfo</a>\
      \ object to the specific mod they used to make the map. I would discourage this\
      \ practice as it restricts the portability of the map between the multi-team\
      \ CTF mods. Say I've downloaded CTF4-Lucius, this has a default gametype of\
      \ CTF4. If I only have CTF+ installed on my machine I will be unable to play\
      \ the map - even though CTF+ will run the map without problems.</p>\n<p>In terms\
      \ of actually building multi-team CTF maps, it's worth bearing the following\
      \ things in mind.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's worth keeping the maps fairly small. Typically\
      \ there will be fewer than 4 players on each of the teams so on large maps the\
      \ action can drag a little.</li>\n<li>Make sure that all bases are equidistant\
      \ from each other (the same distance apart).</li>\n<li>If you are building a\
      \ map specifically for the single flag mode, then make sure the bases are hard\
      \ to defend and the middle area reasonable clear and open. The aim is for the\
      \ flag to spend more time in the middle of the map than at a team's <a href=\"\

      \ merge the CTF+, MCTF, and CTF4 code bases together but it never happened for\
      \ a variety of reasons - the only visible result of the attempt was David Catmull's\
      \ flag mutator.  For UT2003 I'll be doing a single flag CTF mod only, which\
      \ should leave MCTF and CTF4 as the only multi-team CTF mods around.  As for\
      \ the CTF+ idea of making as many teams as there are flags - you can thank the\
      \ Germans for that.  A group of them specifically requested support for 3 team\
      \ maps, and that was the only sensible way to add support for them.  Not that\
      \ they ever made any maps.  MCTF is more than welcome to ''steal the code''\
      \ that dynamically alters the number of teams (I could probably dig out the\
      \ specifics if you wanted).  But hey - maybe a feature for MCTF-UT2003.  I can't\
      \ help thinking that there will be less support for multiple teams in UT2003\
      \ though.\n\nI have seen people set the DefaultGameType property of the [[Legacy:LevelInfo|LevelInfo]]\
      \ object to the specific mod they used to make the map.  I would discourage\
      \ this practice as it restricts the portability of the map between the multi-team\
      \ CTF mods.  Say I've downloaded CTF4-Lucius, this has a default gametype of\
      \ CTF4.  If I only have CTF+ installed on my machine I will be unable to play\
      \ the map - even though CTF+ will run the map without problems.\n\nIn terms\
      \ of actually building multi-team CTF maps, it's worth bearing the following\
      \ things in mind.\n* It's worth keeping the maps fairly small.  Typically there\
      \ will be fewer than 4 players on each of the teams so on large maps the action\
      \ can drag a little.\n* Make sure that all bases are equidistant from each other\
      \ (the same distance apart).\n*If you are building a map specifically for the\
      \ single flag mode, then make sure the bases are hard to defend and the middle\
      \ area reasonable clear and open.  The aim is for the flag to spend more time\
      \ in the middle of the map than at a team's [[Legacy:FlagBase|FlagBase]].\n\n\
