      <p>Let's face it. Ued's texture alignment utilities pretty much suck. It's darn\
      \ near impossible to align the textures on that cylinder, or make a decent looking\
      \ sphere. Even more difficult is trying to create terrain with paths and other\
      \ details. In this tutorial, I will explain how to get your texturing from 3ds\
      \ max 4 into UnrealEd. I will NOT explain how to texture/skin things in Max,\
      \ as 1) I am not very good at this yet, myself. 2) That would be a whole diferrent\
      \ tutorial. Perhaps some other time.</p>\n<p>Obviously, you're going to need\
      \ 3d Studio Max 4 to do this. You'll also need <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\

      mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The best way to do this is\
      \ to export your builder brush to a DXF, go into 3d studio max, and import the\
      \ DXF. Go into the Brush menu in Ued and hit export. Select DXF from the dropdown\
      \ box, and save it to your location of choice. Now, in 3ds max, open the file\

      \ here.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"What_to_do_with_it_once_it.27s_there\"\

      \ your material. You can also skin it using offset and tiling controls. Note\
      \ that you can only rotate in the \"W\" or ASEtoT3D won't translate right. For\
      \ the material make sure you choose a 256x256 bitmap under the diffuse setting\
      \ of your material. Neither colors nor any other setting translates through\
      \ the ASEtoT3D utility. Just plain bitmaps used as the map for diffuse. Note\
      \ that the size of the brush in Max is exactly equal to that in Ued. A 256x256x256\
      \ square in max will import as a 256x256x256 square in Ued. I'm not sure whether\
      \ this changes in the import from DXF so make sure you scale the brush appropriately.</p>\n\

      \ export it with your name of choice. Only the following check boxes should\
      \ be checked in the export options dialog that comes up: Under Output Options:\
      \ Mesh Definition, Materials – Under Materials: Mesh Normals, Mapping Coordinates\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Now, under the brush menu, \"import\" the T3D. The\
      \ texture alignment in the resulting brush will be exactly as it was in Max.\
      \ Also, here's an excerpt from Spooger's site:</p>\n<p>\"Texture association\
      \ in Unreal can be automatic... or not, choice is yours. Before importing the\
      \ T3D into UnrealEd, the textures should be imported and saved in UED first.\
      \ Once done, the textures will be assigned to the brush in Unreal automatically\
      \ during the T3D import by \"name association\". So the textures used in Unreal\
      \ need to have the same name as the ones you assigned in MAX, simple enough.\"\
      </p>\n<p>Note that even if you can't get this automatic thing to work, just\
      \ import your texture and apply it to the brush. It'll be aligned right anyway.\
      \ Any 256x256 texture will be aligned the way you skinned things in max, so\
      \ you can use this to your advantage creating paths and such things on terrain.</p>\n\
      <p>Finally, note that any change you make results in the textures going back\
      \ to default alignment. This means scaling, vertexes, just about anything. I'm\
      \ guessing that you could rotate/pan the textures without it going back to default,\
      \ but I haven't had reason to try. What this means is that even the most minor\
      \ tweak in the geometry of the brush will have to be done in 3ds max to preserve\
      \ your texturing. I don't think there's any way around this - it's just a limitation\
      \ of Ued.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wrapping_it_Up\">Wrapping\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This may seem complicated and difficult, but it really\
      \ isn't as hard as it seems, and it makes real texture alignment possible. Chrysaor\
      \ uses this technique for all of his terrain (which, on a side note, he builds\
      \ in Max). You can see an example if its effectiveness in his excellent map,\

      \ in Max, but it is an incredibly powerful tool and by far worth the trouble.\
