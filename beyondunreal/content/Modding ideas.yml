      <p><b>Camper Hunter</b> (Mutator) This mod would probably be best used on camping/sniping\
      \ servers especially those that have a low player count (maybe 3-4). Some of\
      \ the larger maps turn into people just waiting around for 20 minutes staring\
      \ through their zoomed in scopes at the map's backdrop. This mod would create\
      \ a pawn that, for example, would be a ball of light. The ball of light would\
      \ identify who has the highest score and move (at a config defined speed) towards\
      \ that player... perhaps change color as it gets closer. This would give the\
      \ current leader some incentive to move to a different spot from time to time.\
      \ Other ideas might be a ray of light from the sky (like a spotlight) that may\
      \ at some intervals shine a spot of light on the area where the leader is camped.\
      \ or perhaps expand the idea to all players that the longer your remain in an\
      \ area a radius of light grows around you giving the other players a hint at\
      \ where you are hiding.</p>\n<p><b>Illusion/Clone</b> (Class) This mod would\
      \ be like a grenade thrown and when it lands make a pawn that looks like the\
      \ player and moves in reverse direction to how the player is moving... This\
      \ could be used to give someone that wants to make a desperate dash across a\
      \ wide open area a better chance at reaching the other side. Other idea, perhaps\
      \ it would make the player mostly invisible while showing an image of the player\
      \ slightly offset from the player's real location.</p>\n<p><br />\n<b>GUI Surface</b>\
      \ (System) An ideia for Ut 2k Series, its good for people whos want this in\
      \ your Total conversion or mods, a system of a GUI Surface like a Doom 3 system,\
      \ whit a variet of options like a trigger substitute this is NOT A COPY this\
      \ need to create this system for the zero, with the Unreal Script for a Game\
      \ Mode for example.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Forum.2FChat.2FQuestions\"\
