      \ I had a couple of questions about using Rhino to make static meshes:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Above it says you should use reducemesh to make sure your polycount\
      \ is in base 8 - does that mean to ensure that it's a multiple of 8? (I assume\
      \ that it does)</li>\n<li>When I import my meshes into UEd, the faces are always\
      \ inverted. Is there a way to set Rhino to invert the faces when I save to DXF\
      \ so that they'll be the right way around when I import to UEd?</li>\n<li>Whats\
      \ a good grid scale to use with Rhino? IE, if I want the grid points in Rhino\
      \ to be nice, round numbers of UUs?</li>\n<li>Is there any way (plug-in or otherwise)\
      \ for me to get a little more control over textures? The only texturing ability\
      \ I can find is setting a texture, no ability to UV map or anything like that.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p><b>Sobiwan:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The help file for v3 says nothing about\
      \ base8, so I suspect it was from an earlier version. I tried ReduceMesh and\
      \ found there was no difference from using it compared to converting from nurbs\
      \ to mesh (command = mesh). I kept the text so someone could verify my findings.</li>\n\
      <li>Use analyze -&gt; direction (command = dir) to change the face normal direction.</li>\n\
      <li>Grid scale is custom. See grid text above.</li>\n<li>v3 automatically does\
      \ UV mapping from NURBS to polygon meshes. I dont recall if it was available\
      \ in v1, but it was in v2 since the v3 whatsnew file doesnt list UV mapping.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> The reason your faces are inverted is a result of not\
      \ keeping your polycount in base 8. A polycount of 513 rather than 512 will\
      \ most likely wreak all face-normal havoc upon your mesh.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b>\
      \ What exactly does that mean? I know what Base 8 is, but any number can be\
      \ represented in Base 8, so I'm a bit unclear. Do you mean that the polycount\
      \ has to be a multiple of 8? That is has to be an integrally exponentiated from\
      \ 8? As for the automatic UV mapping.. that's the problem. Rhino decides how\
      \ and where to line up the textures, and I disagree with it's assessment of\
      \ which parts of the skin belong where.&#160;:P Is there anyway to override\
      \ that?</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> 8, 16, 32, etc. usually work best. However, 384-type\
      \ numbers (because 256 + 128 = 384) works most of the time as well. A little\
      \ experimentation is due. As for UV-mapping, I'm lost myself.&#160;:P I usually\
      \ use Milkshape's <tt>Window -&gt; Texture Coordinate Editor</tt>. Not very\
      \ satisfactory though.</p>\n<p><b>Kirk</b>: I've played around with Rhino and\
      \ making static meshes today, and if you have 3DS Max as well... they team up\
      \ really well. You can just make yer NURBS in Rhino, easily and awesome, and\
      \ then export it using the IGES file format. Max can import that, and it supports\
      \ NURBS! So then you'll have Rhino-made NURBS in Max, which you can then UV\
      \ Map is neccesary, or play with the Surface settings of the NURBS object instead.\
      \ You can then use the automatic NURBS tesselation to generate a balanced number\
      \ of polygons (doesn't have to be base 8 or anything), and then you just apply\
      \ texture. You don't even have to collapse the tree or convert to Editable Mesh\
      \ when exporting, from what I've noticed.</p>\n<p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b> I\
      \ made this friggin' awesome spaceship with Rhino. Unfortunatly my computer\
      \ crashed one day...&#160;:( But It was so easy to make with Rhino, and took\
      \ less time then it would have with other modeling apps. I really recommend\
      \ this. One question. Does it have any support for texturing models? ... Milkshape\
      \ is annoying as hell for texturing. I think one can sort of import non-character\
      \ models into UPaint...but...</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> You can texture a model\
      \ in Rhino by editing it's \"object properties.\" However, there is no facility\
      \ to control which parts of the texture appear on which parts of the model.</p>\n\
      <p>I have heard that the \"Dir\" command can be used (in the Rhino console)\
      \ to affect where the texture is centered and stuff, but I haven't tried it.\
      \ I've also heard that a model exported into another piece of software, textured,\
      \ and then imported into Rhino will retain it's UV mapping. I haven't tried\
      \ that either.</p>\n<p>The reason that Rhino has such limited texture mapping\
      \ capability is that it's intended commercial application is for CAD and machining,\
      \ rather than building models for display in a 3D world. Having said that I\
      \ do find it to be superb for creating 3D meshes.</p>\n<p><b>Graphik:</b> Personally,\
      \ I tried Maya and never looked back. Now Rhino seems like nothing more than\
      \ a necessary evil – a stepping-stone on my path to Maya.</p>\n<p><b>Bob_The_Beheader:</b>\
      \ O.k. Should have read what other people said before I asked about textureing...stupid\
      \ of me... I find Maya to be a necessary evil, 'cept for animation. To each\
      \ his/her own I guess.</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCPU time usage: 0.037\
