      <p>Mutators are a way to implement a modification, but they are not the <i>only</i>\
      \ way. Mutators have to follow some important guidelines, which do not apply\
      \ to new gametypes or total conversions (TCs), the other two types of <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Mod\" title=\"Legacy:Mod\" class=\"mw-redirect\">mod</a> in Unreal.</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>Mutators should work with any <a href=\"/Legacy:Gametype\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Gametype\">gametype</a>. (However, there are mutators which were written\
      \ only for certain game types, e.g. the Jail Fight mutator for UT <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Jailbreak\" title=\"Legacy:Jailbreak\">Jailbreak</a>.)</li>\n<li>Mutators\
      \ should work with each other, that means any other mutator that someone might\
      \ make. (Of course, two arena mutators won't work together, but nobody would\
      \ expect that.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Roughly, mutators make a small difference to\
      \ the game: they change settings such as speed or gravity, they add a weapon\
      \ or a power-up and so on. The player should be able to set and configure mutators\
      \ as if they were just extra game options.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      <p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> It kind of is. There is an \"bAddToServerPackages\" property\
