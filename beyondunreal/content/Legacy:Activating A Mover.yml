      <p>The next step after setting up your mover and its keyframes is adding in\
      \ a <a href=\"/Legacy:Trigger\" title=\"Legacy:Trigger\">Trigger</a> to make\
      \ it work. Note that you do not <i>have</i> to have a trigger to make the mover\

      \ with \"Trigger*\". For the purposes of a mover, you can use any type of Trigger\
      \ you want, it doesn't matter. To get the mover to activate set the Events -&gt;\

      \ trigger to the Events -&gt; <a href=\"/Legacy:Tag\" title=\"Legacy:Tag\">Tag</a>\

      \ a subclass of Trigger to trigger a mover. A mover can even be triggered by\
      \ another mover, as long as the other mover's Event is set to the triggered\
      \ mover's Tag. In the case of certain mods (like Jailbreak), you may also have\
      \ the mover be triggered by events that are fired off by the game itself. Really,\
      \ any Event that matches the mover's Tag will cause it to activate.</p>\n<h2><span\

      \n# what will make the mover start moving? This is its ''activation method''\n\
      # how far along its keyframe sequence will it move & when will it come back?\
      \ This is set by the [[Legacy:InitialState|InitialState]].\n\n==Activation Methods==\n\
      \n===Triggering===\n\nThe mover is activated by being triggered. This can be\
      \ by:\n* a [[Legacy:Trigger|Trigger]] (or [[Legacy:Dispatcher|Dispatcher]],\
      \ [[Legacy:RoundRobin|RoundRobin]], etc) \n* another type of event, such as\
      \ something the game itself generates (eg a flag capture)\n* the mover itself,\
      \ with '''BumpEvent''': a player bumps the mover, which fires the BumpEvent,\
      \ which matches the mover's Events -> Tag. See \"bumping\" below.\n* Another\
      \ mover (A button, switch, etc) using the MoverEvents section of its properties.\n\
      \nFor a mover to be activated by triggering, set Object->InitialState to one\
      \ of the 'TriggerFoo' [[Legacy:State|state]]s. \n\n===Bumping===\n\nThe mover\
      \ is activated by an actor touching it. The BumpType property determines which\
      \ actors count as valid.\n\n* Use one of the Bump states\n* Set the mover's\
      \ BumpEvent property to match its Tag, so it triggers itself when bumped, and\
      \ use a 'TriggerFoo' state.\n\n===Standing===\n\nThe mover is activated by an\
      \ actor standing on it. This is often used for lifts.\n\n: anyone know how the\
      \ engine differentiates between \"bump\" and \"stand\"?\n\n'''Legal:''' You\
      \ have to stand on top of it rather than just bumping (running into the side\

      \ (UT)|bot (UT)]] stands on it.  \n\n===Door===\n\nTriggerOpenTimed and TriggerControl\
      \ are both often used for doors. Both will start opening when triggered, but\
      \ there is a differnce in what happens next:\n\n* TriggerOpenTimed will open,\
      \ wait, close automatically regardless of where the player is.\n\n* TriggerControl\
      \ will open, and stay open as long as the player is still standing in the Trigger.\
      \ The moment the player steps out, it will reverse direction and close, even\
      \ if it was only partially open. \n\nTriggerControl is used in DM-StalwartXL\
