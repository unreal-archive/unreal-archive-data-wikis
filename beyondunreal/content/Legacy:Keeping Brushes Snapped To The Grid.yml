  text:
    text: "<p>World of boxes is not the most interesting map. So we want to add more\
      \ shapes, and that involves more complicated <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP\" title=\"\
      Legacy:BSP\">BSP</a>'s. So we rotate them, add or subtract in different ways,\
      \ to make creative enviroinment we want. For example, some begginer mapper created\
      \ a room by adding polygonal brush and subtracted rotated rectangular brush\
      \ for entrance:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/File:Legacy_brushalignbad.jpeg\" class=\"\
      image\" title=\"Legacy_brushalignbad.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Legacy_brushalignbad.jpeg\"\
      \ src=\"/w/images/Legacy_brushalignbad.jpeg\" width=\"476\" height=\"292\" /></a></p>\n\
      <p>That may work just fine as long as he does not have any other geometry around.\
      \ But in more complicated map there <b>must</b> be more geometry around, and\
      \ when he starts adding it, he will found that lots of brushes starts overlaping\
      \ each other (yes, i saw maps like that):</p>\n<p><a href=\"/File:Legacy_BrushAlignBad2.jpeg\"\
      \ class=\"image\" title=\"Legacy_BrushAlignBad2.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Legacy_BrushAlignBad2.jpeg\"\
      \ src=\"/w/images/Legacy_BrushAlignBad2.jpeg\" width=\"448\" height=\"310\"\
      \ /></a></p>\n<p>As we all know, <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealEd_Goblin\" title=\"\
      Legacy:UnrealEd Goblin\">UED goblin</a> doesn't like that. In worst cases UED\
      \ may even crash when <a href=\"/Legacy:Rebuild\" title=\"Legacy:Rebuild\">rebuilding</a>\
      \ BSP, but lucky ones will only get some random <a href=\"/Legacy:BSP_Hole\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:BSP Hole\">BSP holes</a> (i know, random is fun&#160;:D).</p>\n\
      <p>Actually, sollution is simple, as long as you keep <b>ALL</b> vertexes of\
      \ <b>ALL</b> brushes <a href=\"/Legacy:Snap_To_Grid\" title=\"Legacy:Snap To\
      \ Grid\">snapped to grid</a>. Compare these pictures with previous ones:</p>\n\
      <p><a href=\"/File:Legacy_brushaligngood.jpeg\" class=\"image\" title=\"Legacy_brushaligngood.jpeg\"\
      ><img alt=\"Legacy_brushaligngood.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_brushaligngood.jpeg\"\

      \ class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Legacy BrushAlignGood2.jpeg\" src=\"/w/images/Legacy_BrushAlignGood2.jpeg\"\
      \ width=\"362\" height=\"292\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you align all brushes like\
      \ that, without them intersecting each other, you can almost forget about <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:BSP_Hole\" title=\"Legacy:BSP Hole\">BSP holes</a>. If you\
      \ still get holes anyway, make sure all sides of brushes are planar. Also, you\
      \ will soon find that it is much easier to add more BSP around well aligned\
      \ brushes and to texture it.</p>\n<p>Few notes on how to do that easily:</p>\n\
      <ul>\n<li>You can select several vertices at once in rectangular area (in <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Vertex_Editing\" title=\"Legacy:Vertex Editing\">vertex editing</a>\
      \ mode <a href=\"/File:Legacy_button.mode.vertex.gif\" class=\"image\" title=\"\
      Legacy_button.mode.vertex.gif\"><img alt=\"Legacy_button.mode.vertex.gif\" src=\"\
      /w/images/Legacy_button.mode.vertex.gif\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" /></a>),\
      \ by holding <i>Ctrl+Alt+Left Mouse Button</i>.</li>\n<li>Right click on one\
      \ of selected vertices to align all of them to grid.</li>\n<li>When you need\
      \ to move already aligned vertices (in vertex editing mode), always do that\
      \ with <i>Ctrl</i> <b>OR</b> <i>Ctrl+Shift</i> to keep them snaping to grid.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<p>Thats all. Its hard to fix already big map with brush-jungle in it,\
      \ but it is easy to make everything right from begining.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ Keeping brushes on grid mainly helps because that ensures that all sides of\
      \ brush are planar... (i guess). Can anyone confirm this? I just wrote this\
      \ from my own experience, because making maps this way never caused any holes\
      \ in it. BTW, all sides of antiportals also MUST be planar, so aligning vertices\
      \ to grid helps here too.</p>\n<p><b>Nercury:</b> Ok, i have spend some time\
      \ trying to create BSP hole, i used two intersecting brushes. I was unable to\
      \ create any hole with not planar cube faces (geometry was very simple though),\
      \ but i was very succesfull as soon as i turned off <a href=\"/Legacy:Snap_To_Grid\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Snap To Grid\">Snap To Grid</a> feature. So my conclusion is:\
      \ align, align, and align.</p>\n<p><b>StarWeaver:</b> In generic mode (camera\
      \ mode? whatever the editor starts in), right clicking a vertex of any selected\
      \ brush or set of selected brushes will both set the pivot to that vertex and\
      \ snap that vertex to the nearest grid point (dragging along the entire selection).\
      \ It's really helpful when I import a builder brush or insert a prefab and it\
      \ decides to place it at some random off-grid or on-some-other-grid location.</p>\n\
      <p>Also, I don't understand that note about making sure to hold control while\

      \ editor regardless of grid settings, unless I'm missing something?</p>\n<p><b>Nercury:</b>\
      \ I guess yes, unless your Unreal Editor works well... If you notice, that vertexes\
      \ do not snap to grid when moving them, just hold ctrl&#160;:)</p>\n<h2><span\
