      <p>Now you have a little hollow cube. A \"room\" for our purposes. But it doesn't\
      \ look anything like even a basic cube you'd see in Unreal. To fix that, we\
      \ need some light:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Add a light actor</dt>\n<dd>Right-click within\
      \ the dimensions of your cube in any veiw (A 2D view is recommended), then click\
      \ \"Add light here\" in the menu that pops up.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Build\
      \ the level</dt>\n<dd>Press F8 on your keyboard, and click \"Build\" in the\
      \ Build menu that comes up.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\
      PlayerStart\">PlayerStart</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: PlayerStart\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Now you have light. Your room now looks like it will\
      \ in-game, but the game won't know where to put you if you try and play it now.\
      \ Lastly, we need a PlayerStart:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Add a PlayerStart</dt>\n<dd>Right-click\
      \ within the dimensions of your cube in any veiw, then click \"Add PlayerStart\
      \ here\" in the menu that pops up.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Build the level again</dt>\n\
      <dd>Press F8 on your keyboard, and click \"Build\" in the Build menu that comes\
      \ up.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Now you have a finished level. Save it (File -&gt; Save)\
      \ with a DM- prefix just like any other Deathmatch level, then play (Build -&gt;\
      \ Play Level).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Back to <a href=\"/Legacy:Mapping_Lessons\" title=\"\
