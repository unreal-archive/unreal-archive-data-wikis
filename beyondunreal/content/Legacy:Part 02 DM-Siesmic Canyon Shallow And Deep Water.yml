    text: "<p>I have UTEd4 running, I then click new in the tool bar and make an additive\
      \ map, because I am not going to distribute this <i>(infact I'm not even going\
      \ to publish it)</i>, I will be able to directly use the textures and materials\
      \ from my content pack.</p>\n<p>So opening the Generic Browser, I ensure my\
      \ content pack is loaded <i>(ASphinx-Content)</i>.</p>\n<p>I then throw down\
      \ a real simple BSP level, I have chosen to have three rooms and two corridors\
      \ connecting them, the first room has shallow water, the hall leading away also.\
      \ The second room is deeper, and has a submerged corridor leading to the third\
      \ room, which is as deep as the second, see <b>Tile #01</b> to view my setup\
      \ in the toolset.</p>\n<p>The water surface is nothing more than a plane, you\
      \ cna't use the BSP for this however, because of shadows and lighting, you will\
      \ need a static mesh, fortunately UT3 has a built-in static mesh plane in the\
      \ pre-loaded package named <b>UN_SimpleMeshes</b>, in the generic browser, find\
      \ it, then right click it and select the option <b>Fully Load</b>, on the right\
      \ hand side you should a few staic meshes with the default material.</p>\n<p>Select\
      \ the plane <i>(named <b>TexPropPlane_Dup</b>)</i>.</p>\n<p>Going back to the\
      \ 3D Render viewport of your test level, right click on the ground, and add\
      \ actor, the top option in the fold-out list should be the static mesh option,\
      \ select it to place the mesh on the ground.</p>\n<p>By default, this mesh stands\
      \ upright, ie. not parallel to the ground, it is also one-sided, which means\
      \ you might not see it from your current viewing angle, move around till you\
      \ see the plane, if you are having troubles still seeing it, try press 'w',\
      \ this is the key that toggles whether static meshes are visible or not, and\
      \ you might have them turned off in your view port, and switch to rotation mode\
      \ by pressing space, and rotate it so it <i>is</i> parallel to the ground, then\
      \ pressing space twice more, raise it so it is 32 units above the ground surface.</p>\n\
      <p>The mesh itself doesn't actually fit my rooms which are 512x512 on the X/Y\
      \ axis, if you measure the mesh, you will find it measures 320x320.</p>\n<p>The\
      \ scaling option will allow you to make the mesh fit more easily, I chose to\
      \ place four of these meshes in each room, having one in each corner, matching\
      \ up to each other seemlessly, I also made two of them fit in the 1st corridor,\
      \ the second corridor is compleatly submerged, so it will have no water surface.\
      \ You can see how I have lined these meshes up in <b>Tile #02</b> <i>(Don't\
      \ forget to do the other room as well, it is not shown in the tile, but it will\
      \ also have a surface)</i>, the ones in the corridor extend through the wall,\
      \ this is so that the water surface textures don't have nasty seems across them.</p>\n\
      <p>The next step is to add the surface material we made in an earlier chapter,\
      \ select all the planes we just put into the level, go to their properties.\
      \ Under the <i>StaticMeshActor -&gt; StaticMeshComponent -&gt; Rendering -&gt;\
      \ Materials</i>, add a material by clicking the green + symbol on the right,\
      \ click the magnifying glass to show the generic browser in the new line that\
      \ appears below, and select the water surface material. By clicking the green\
      \ arrow pointing left, which can be found back in the properties window directly\
      \ next to the magnifying glass you just clicked to open the generic browser,\
      \ you will assign the material to the mesh.</p>\n<p>While still in the properties,\
      \ you will need to navigate to <i>StaticMeshActor -&gt; StaticMeshComponent\
      \ -&gt; Lighting</i> and uncheck the box next to bAcceptLights, finally to allow\
      \ players to fall through this surface you will need to go to <i>Collision -&gt;\
      \ CollisionType</i> and change the value to <b>COLLIDE_NoCollision</b>.</p>\n\
      <p>Now we need to designate that the area under this mesh is actually a water\
      \ volume.</p>\n<p>You will need to shape your brush to fit the areas inbetween\
      \ the surface and the ground, and add <b>UTWaterVolume</b>s to fill these areas,\
      \ the <b>UTWaterVolume</b> can be found on the left under the <i>Add Volume</i>\
      \ button.</p>\n<p>After this I quickly jumped over to 3DS Max and threw together\
      \ a quick mesh that will represent the fog volume, it was measured out to be\
      \ exactly 1 unit smaller than the actuall area it is going to fill (ie. a 1\
      \ unit border all the way around), you can see it in <b>Tile #03</b>. I applied\
      \ a material, and quickly set the UVWs, then imported it to UTEd4.</p>\n<h3><span\
