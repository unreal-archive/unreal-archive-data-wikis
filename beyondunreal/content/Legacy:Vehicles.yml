      \ Would it be even slightly feasible to add a tutorial explaining how to add\
      \ a vehicle to a map and make it usable? I'm trying to get to grips with Ued\
      \ and it seems that vehicles are a particularly complex area... either that\
      \ or I'm just terminally thick&#160;:) I'm trying to add an ONSRV vehicle to\
      \ a DM map that I'm building just to learn with, and when I get to the place\
      \ where the vehicle should be, all I see is thin air&#160;:) Thank you.&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>LordRichard2:</b> I've tried to make an SVeh with a turret (tank) and\
      \ a passenger turret and room for 4 passengers. I've modeled it but setting\
      \ up bones,animating,coding, and position is very hard for me. Can someone show\
      \ me a custom vehicle script i can modify and use as a base. I've tried modifying\
      \ the ut2004 source but it gets tons of errors. I can use milkshape maya and\
      \ am learning 3ds max i recently got...</p>\n<p><b>sweavo:</b> Factored out\
      \ the pre-ut2004 vehicles stuff because it's a completely different type of\
      \ information. I imagine that the 2004 stuff will continue to apply in UT3,\
      \ whereas the old page (now at <a href=\"/Legacy:Vehicles_Pre2004\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Vehicles Pre2004\">Vehicles Pre2004</a> is all about how to hack vehicles\
      \ out of thin air!</p>\n<p><b>amitakartok:</b> As far as I know, you can only\
      \ add vehicles to gametypes that support them (AS, ONS, VCTF). In AS, place\
      \ an ASVehicleFactory, go to it's propertities, SVehicleFactory then select\
      \ the one you want in VehicleClass. In ONS, use an ONSVehicleFactory in the\
      \ same way, however these will auto-associate with the nearest powernode/powercore.\
      \ The sole exception is the two spacefighters. If you try to spawn them, they\
      \ will crash into the first surface they meet and explode. I didn't understood\
      \ this for a while, until I read that they have a minimum velocity setting and\
      \ are coded to explode when touches a surface. I opened AS-MotherShip so I now\
      \ know the workaround for this. Use a terminal or something, linked to an ASTriggerUseAndRespawn.\
      \ Select a PlayerSpawnManager (not sure if works) anywhere in the map, and link\
      \ it to a PlayerStart in mid-air. Finally, enter into the properties of the\
      \ spawnmanager and select the ForcedPawnClass, enter the vehicle of your liking\
      \ and off you go... I'm currently experimenting on Torlan by placing a ship\
      \ onto the towers' of the bases, then making it fly around the map. The only\
      \ problem is, how can you exit without dying?</p>\n<p><b>computergod666:</b>\
      \ I think the way that Unreal engines handle vehicles has a few flaws. In order\
      \ to create a vehicle, do you have to make a <i>model</i> for it? For those\
      \ of you who are familiar with the Half-Life series, moving objects are created\
      \ as \"brush-based entities\" – similar to movers in Unreal. What Unreal really\
      \ needs is a vehicle class that is a subclass of mover. Alternatively, there\
      \ could be a simple trigger, positioned relative to any existing type of mover,\
      \ that allows someone to step into the vehicle and drive it. I'm willing to\
      \ code this for UT, because I think using models for anything simple like vehicles\
      \ or crates is a waste of time. It would be so much easier to make dynamic brushes.</p>\n\
      <p><b>KhaaahM:</b> In the SVehicle properties under \"Advanced\", set the \"\
      bGameRelevant\" to true and the \"bNoDelete\" to true aswell. Then go down to\
      \ \"Vehicle\" and set the property called \"Team\" to 255. Rebuild and play\
      \ and VOILA! Instant action with your vehicle on a DM map = flawless victory...\
