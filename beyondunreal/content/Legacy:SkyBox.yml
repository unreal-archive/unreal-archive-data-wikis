      <p>A skybox is a method of making a very nice looking sky using the Unreal Engine.\
      \ It is far superior to simply plastering sky textures to the ceiling of the\
      \ world. A skybox creates an illusion of great distance because your movement\
      \ in the level does not result in any movement of the skybox. This is only reasonable\
      \ as moving from one end of a building to the other does not place you any appreciable\
      \ distance closer to the sun and the clouds.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"How_does_it_work.3F\">How does it work?</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: How does it work?\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The workings of a skybox are actually quite simple\
      \ internally. If any portion of a surface with <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Flags_(UT)#Fake_Backdrop\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Surface Flags (UT)\">Fake Backdrop</a> set is visible, the\
      \ skybox is drawn before any other drawing takes place. In other words, the\
      \ skybox is drawn, then the rest of the world is drawn overtop of it. Surfaces\
      \ with <i>Fake Backdrop</i> are not drawn at all, thus allowing the skybox to\
      \ be \"seen\" \"through\" them. This is similar to looking through a fence -\
      \ if you imagine the yard beyond drawn first and then the fence drawn overtop\
      \ of it, you can still see the yard beyond through the openings and cracks in\
      \ the fence. Likewise you can see the skybox \"through\" the faked backdrops\
      \ in your level.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tips_and_Tricks_for_Skyboxes\"\

      <p>By default it is possible to have more than one SkyZone on a level. One of\
      \ the SkyZoneInfo actors should have Advanced -&gt; bHighDetail = false, and\
      \ the other set to True.</p>\n<p>This allows level designers to build complex\
      \ SkyZones for systems running in a high detail mode without inflicting the\
      \ additional penalty of a complex Sky Zone on the machine running in low detail.\
      \ CTF-Face uses both high and low detail Sky Zones.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Clouds\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>A typical skybox has two sheets of clouds, both <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Flags_(UT)#Translucent\" title=\"Legacy:Surface Flags\
      \ (UT)\">translucent</a>. The sheets are in the top of the skybox, spaced 16\
      \ units. Both sheets have either V-Pan or U-Pan turned on in their properties.\
      \ The lower sheet should have a higher texture scale than the upper sheet. This\
      \ makes the \"lower hanging clouds\" move faster than the \"background clouds\"\
      .</p>\n<p>The V-Pan or U-Pan is generally too fast to be realistic. Set the\
      \ V-Pan and U-Pan values to about 0.3. You can find this in the Sky<a href=\"\
      /Legacy:ZoneInfo\" title=\"Legacy:ZoneInfo\">ZoneInfo</a> actor's properties,\
      \ under ZoneLighting.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Moons_.26_Suns\"\

      \ &amp; Suns\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>If you add a moon or a sun, don't forget to place it higher than the clouds\
      \ and scale them down, for a distance effect. Generally placing a sun or moon\
      \ texture on a sheet and having it face the skybox creates a much better looking\
      \ effect than using an actual spherical mesh in the skybox, and it also generates\
      \ less of a performance hit.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coronas\"\

      \ will not be drawn natively in a skybox. If you want one to be displayed, you\
      \ will have to manually add a sheet or an actor and set a corona texture to\
      \ it. You can set the corona texture directly to the light if you set it's bHidden\

      \ add extra lights, don't increase the radius of the existing lights too much.\
      \ It usually doesn't look too good.</li>\n<li>Set the saturation to a very low\

      \ the ZoneInfo and look around. If you can still see those edges, you can either\
      \ move the SkyZoneInfo closer to the floor, move the skyline sheets closer to\

      <p>If both a warp portal and the skybox are visible to the player, the polys\

      <p>1. make a cube 510x510x510 &amp; texture it with your sky package</p>\n<p>2.\
      \ make sure the faces are the right way round (they usually get flipped in the\
      \ U plane on some or all faces)</p>\n<p>3. you might have to scale U &amp; V\
      \ depending on what size textures you use. (For example, LavaSky has 512x256\
      \ walls so you should scale these U:1 &amp; V:2) You will have to re-rotate\
      \ your textures again in a minute but its useful to know at this stage that\
      \ your surfaces are all flipped correctly and the correct textures are on the\
      \ correct face to save time later on.</p>\n<p>4. VERY IMPORTANT: select all\
      \ faces &amp; do a 'box alignment' (leave the U &amp; V scaling @ default for\
      \ this type of alignment -ie 1:1)</p>\n<p>5. rescale (if needed) and then U\
      \ &amp; V pan the surfaces if needed (&amp; rotate also if needed –you will\
      \ most likely need to do this on the ceiling &amp; floor after panning) -everything\
      \ should pan nicely into position with increments of 64 or 16.</p>\n<p>6. admire\

    text: "'''Tarquin:'''  okay, editorial decision is needed here, so I've taken\
      \ it :) This page is henceforth to be:\n* a ''definition'' of the term \"skybox\"\
      \n* technical stuff about skyboxes\n* list of cool things to do with a skybox.\n\
      \n[[Legacy:Building A SkyBox|Building a SkyBox]] is now the tutorial page.\n\
      \n==What is a Skybox?==\n\nA skybox is a method of making a very nice looking\
      \ sky using the Unreal Engine. It is far superior to simply plastering sky textures\
      \ to the ceiling of the world. A skybox creates an illusion of great distance\
      \ because your movement in the level does not result in any movement of the\
      \ skybox. This is only reasonable as moving from one end of a building to the\
      \ other does not place you any appreciable distance closer to the sun and the\
      \ clouds.\n\n==How does it work?==\n\nThe workings of a skybox are actually\
      \ quite simple internally. If any portion of a surface with [[Legacy:Surface_Flags_%28UT%29#Fake_Backdrop|Fake\
      \ Backdrop]] set is visible, the skybox is drawn before any other drawing takes\
      \ place. In other words, the skybox is drawn, then the rest of the world is\
      \ drawn overtop of it. Surfaces with ''Fake Backdrop'' are not drawn at all,\
      \ thus allowing the skybox to be \"seen\" \"through\" them. This is similar\
      \ to looking through a fence - if you imagine the yard beyond drawn first and\
      \ then the fence drawn overtop of it, you can still see the yard beyond through\
      \ the openings and cracks in the fence. Likewise you can see the skybox \"through\"\
      \ the faked backdrops in your level.\n\n==Tips and Tricks for Skyboxes==\n\n\
      ===High-detail Skybox===\n\nBy default it is possible to have more than one\
      \ SkyZone on a level.  One of the SkyZoneInfo actors should have Advanced ->\
      \ bHighDetail = false, and the other set to True. \n\nThis allows level designers\
      \ to build complex SkyZones for systems running in a high detail mode without\
      \ inflicting the additional penalty of a complex Sky Zone on the machine running\
      \ in low detail. CTF-Face uses both high and low detail Sky Zones.\n\n===Clouds===\n\
      \nA typical skybox has two sheets of clouds, both [[Legacy:Surface_Flags_%28UT%29#Translucent|translucent]].\
      \  The sheets are in the top of the skybox, spaced 16 units.  Both sheets have\
      \ either V-Pan or U-Pan turned on in their properties.  The lower sheet should\
      \ have a higher texture scale than the upper sheet.  This makes the \"lower\
      \ hanging clouds\" move faster than the \"background clouds\".\n\nThe V-Pan\
      \ or U-Pan is generally too fast to be realistic.  Set the V-Pan and U-Pan values\
      \ to about 0.3. You can find this in the Sky[[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]] actor's\
      \ properties, under ZoneLighting.\n\n===Moons & Suns===\n\nIf you add a moon\
      \ or a sun, don't forget to place it higher than the clouds and scale them down,\
      \ for a distance effect. Generally placing a sun or moon texture on a sheet\
      \ and having it face the skybox creates a much better looking effect than using\
      \ an actual spherical mesh in the skybox, and it also generates less of a performance\
      \ hit.\n\n===Coronas===\n\nCoronas will not be drawn natively in a skybox. If\
      \ you want one to be displayed, you will have to manually add a sheet or an\
      \ actor and set a corona texture to it. You can set the corona texture directly\
      \ to the light if you set it's bHidden property to false.\n\n===Lighting ===\n\
      * Add some lights with small radii: about 12 or 16 is good.  You can vary the\
      \ hue of these lights to get a nice gradient along the sky.  If the skybox is\
      \ underlit, then add extra lights, don't increase the radius of the existing\
      \ lights too much.  It usually doesn't look too good.\n* Set the saturation\
      \ to a very low level if you want to override e.g. the blue sky texture.  You\
      \ can also create your own texture with another background color and add it\
      \ to your MyLevel package.\n* [[Legacy:Special Lit|Special Lit]] can also be\
      \ used to good effect in a Skybox, to get a more varied mix of [[Legacy:Colors|Colors]]\
      \ with less light actors.\n\n===Panorama ===\n\nAdd the SkyZoneInfo in the middle\
      \ of the skybox, near the floor.  Create four sheets (64*128) with masked textures\
      \ of mountains or city skylines around the Info (or make just one brush with\
      \ the Panorama builder!).  These sheets need to prevent the player from seeing\
      \ the place where your cloud sheets touch the end of the skybox.  You can check\
      \ this by moving your camera on the place of the ZoneInfo and look around. \
      \ If you can still see those edges, you can either move the SkyZoneInfo closer\
      \ to the floor, move the skyline sheets closer to the Info, or make the skybox\
      \ bigger.\n:''suggestions for textures''\n\n===UT 2003 and XIII Skybox Terrain===\n\
      \n[[Legacy:Terrain|Terrain]] was a pain in the past and only attempted in the\
      \ skybox by a few adventurous mappers, but with the new editor(s) it's a snap.\
      \ Make a skybox a little larger than standard and scale a terrain info to fit.\
      \ Place the SkyZoneInfo in a 'valley' and add a [[Legacy:Sunlight|Sunlight]]\
      \ actor with the same direction as the map's sunlight actor(s). Set the appropriate\
      \ surfaces as fake backdrop, rebuild and select the SkyZoneInfo again. With\
      \ the camera somewhere inside your map and not in the skybox, position your\
      \ SkyZoneInfo low enough in a 'valley' that the horizon is completely skybox\
      \ terrain and skybox 'ceiling'. None or very little of the skybox walls should\
      \ show if this is done correctly. Doing this and scaling the terrain can be\
      \ tricky and frustrating, but also has the potential to produce some seriously\
      \ nice looking scenery when combined with other techniques. Framerates may vary.\
      \ \n\n===Mover Effects ===\n\nYou can also try to incorperate movers into your\
      \ skybox as maybe lightning or something, try experimenting with loop movers\
      \ to create some realistic lighting by setting it to come in and out of the\
      \ skybox and with a thunder sound to it. See [[Legacy:Lightning Storm|Lightning\
      \ Storm]].\n\n===Fog===\n\nYour skyzone can use fog like any other zone. Note,\
      \ however, that because the skyzone is generally much smaller than it looks,\
      \ the fog will have to be set relatively dense to be noticeable. Note that because\
      \ the skybox will be drawn on top of whatever else is visible, it can impact\
      \ the performance of your level, though due to the small size of the skybox\
      \ it is often not a big issue. See the [[Legacy:Fog|Fog]] page for information\
      \ on how to add fog to a skybox.\n\n==SkyBox problems ==\n\n===Warp Zones ===\n\
      \nIt's been noted that warp zones cause problems with the skybox. (I've seen\
      \ this but not tried to reproduce the symptoms experimentally :) &ndash; Tarquin).\n\
      \nIf both a warp portal and the skybox are visible to the player, the polys\
      \ seen through the warp zone are also drawn in the sky. It may be possible (though\
      \ tricky) to ensure that the warp polys are small enough so they aren't drawn\
      \ in the same part of the screen as the sky polys.\n\n===HOM Effect ===\n\n\
      I have noticed that sometimes when your fiddling with your skybox it may turn\
      \ into a bsp hole where you have checked the fake backdrop off. So if that happens\
      \ select all skybox brushes -> order -> to last (you may have to do this for\
      \ each brush in your skybox individually ) and that should fix your problems\
      \ after a rebuild. \n\nTip to me from Bot_40\n\n===Skybox Seams===\n\nThis is\
      \ majorly annoying in UT2003 skyboxes but I have found a nice easy solution:\n\
      \n1. make a cube 510x510x510 & texture it with your sky package \n\n2. make\
      \ sure the faces are the right way round (they usually get flipped in the U\
      \ plane on some or all faces) \n\n3. you might have to scale U & V depending\
      \ on what size textures you use. (For example, LavaSky has 512x256 walls so\
      \ you should scale these U:1 & V:2) You will have to re-rotate your textures\
      \ again in a minute but its useful to know at this stage that your surfaces\
      \ are all flipped correctly and the correct textures are on the correct face\
      \ to save time later on. \n\n4. VERY IMPORTANT: select all faces & do a 'box\
      \ alignment' (leave the U & V scaling @ default for this type of alignment -ie\
      \ 1:1) \n\n5. rescale (if needed) and then U & V pan the surfaces if needed\
      \ (& rotate also if needed –you will most likely need to do this on the ceiling\
      \ & floor after panning) -everything should pan nicely into position with increments\
      \ of 64 or 16. \n\n6. admire your lovely seam-free skybox :) -rors\n\n===Missing\
      \ Skybox in Multiplayer ===\n\nThis issue can be fixed by simply adding a [[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]]\
      \ actor within the zone/negative space.  Be sure to rebuild your geometry after\
      \ adding it.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Building A SkyBox|Building A\
      \ SkyBox]] - Tutorial\n* [[Legacy:SkyZoneInfo|SkyZoneInfo]]\n\n==Discussion==\n\
      \n'''Dma:'''  Can one skybox link to another skybox?  (I know it is a strange\
      \ question!)\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  you mean using the MultiSkybox actor? don't\
      \ know. sounds interesting...\n\n'''TaoPaiPai:''' It wouldn't be of too much\
      \ interest unless the other skybox is animated from the first you wouldn't see\
      \ the difference.\n\n'''[Apoc]Famine:''' We had a bizarre problem with rendering\
      \ skyboxes in network play. Maps and static meshes are installed on the server,\
      \ and they are pushed to clients. The skyzone, level, and texture properties\
      \ are the same as in working skybox levels, (antalus, etc) and they work fine\
      \ in local play. However, once people connect via the server, the skybox fails\
      \ to render. \n\nThis issue can be fixed by simply adding a ZoneInfo actor.\
      \ Most mappers will use one as good building practice, but we've seen a few\
      \ without. And, of course, to the mapper, all looks well if they don't test\
      \ their map on a network.\n\nA ZoneInfo actor must be placed in every zone you\
      \ want to see your SkyBox in. (Yeah, I learned this the hard way.. ;)\n\n'''DeepQantas:'''\
      \ Ok, I have this little theory of mine, which might or might not work. Since\
      \ it's basically all about Skybox, I though I'd throw it over here. So, suppose\
      \ you're building a huge city map. For performance reasons, you start using\
      \ fog to cut off anything beyond a short range. But then you think, wouldn't\
      \ it still be cool to see those far away buildings. Well... Have a gander at\
      \ [[Legacy:LOD Cheat|LOD Cheat]]\n\n'''ChosenReject:''' I am having a really\
      \ hard time finding the answer to this problem i'm having with certain textures\
      \ that would be used in a skybox (SkyRenders, AnubisSky, etc.).  In UT2004's\
      \ version of unrealed when i add those textures I get a garbled mess of a texture,\
      \ that looks like all the colors were averaged and that average shows up.  I\
      \ don't get the problem in UT2003's unrealed, unreal II's unrealed or even with\
      \ most textures.  I also tried using unrealed from unreal II but using anubisSky\
      \ from both the UT2003 textures and UT2004's textures but it worked fine so\
      \ it must be just UT2004's unrealed.  I have googled a lot and haven't found\
      \ anyone with an answer.  What gives?  (I have an Intel p4 2.4 GHz, 1GB ram,\
      \ and Nvidia GeForce FX 5900 with AA and AF set to application preferred if\
      \ that helps).\n\n'''FreshMeat:''' My big issue, when making a skybox, is that\
      \ it's entirely obvious that it is, indeed, a box. I found some textures I really\
      \ like, I've been applying them to the walls of the box, and it looks hideous.\
      \ Obviously i'm missing something, probably something to do with a static mesh...\
      \ can you retexture static meshes somehow?\n\n'''SuperApe:''' To answer you\
      \ question, yes.  Just fill in Display -> Skins slots until you've found the\
      \ slot you want to replace and replace it on your static mesh instance in the\
      \ map. (not in the static mesh browser)  But, it sounds more like you're having\
      \ problems aligning textures in the skybox and getting the SkyZoneInfo in the\
      \ right place.  Tutorial external link added.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Refactor\
