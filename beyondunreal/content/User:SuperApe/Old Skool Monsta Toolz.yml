      \ a new gametype, <b>OSM Adventure (OSM)</b>, which makes use of all classes\
      \ in the toolset to facilitate story-driven adventures through progressive Objectives\
      \ comprised of puzzles, traps and monsters. I humbly thank Steven Polge and\
      \ the rest of the team at Epic for the original design plan for the AI. This\
      \ toolset is a loving adaptation of the original work.</p>\n<p>The project's\
      \ aim is to allow UT2004 mappers to create maps that take advantage of this\
      \ well-designed AI scheme in any gametype, especially in story-driven adventures.</p>\n\
      <p><i>As a side note, I'd like to mention that while I've been aware of Unreal\
      \ and UT for a long time and have become familiar with the original code through\
      \ UnrealWiki, I never had these games so I relied on online documentation and\

      <p>This is a package that includes a full toolset for mappers to implement Old\
      \ Skool-style Unreal Monsters in maps. In early versions of Unreal, the Monsters\
      \ were a subclass of <a href=\"/Legacy:ScriptedPawn\" title=\"Legacy:ScriptedPawn\"\
      >ScriptedPawn</a>, an all-purpose scripted character class that contained sophisticated\
      \ AI. In later versions of Unreal, a new scheme split much of the functionality\
      \ of ScriptedPawns into Pawn and Controller classes. In UT2004, some of the\
      \ original monster models were re-introduced in a gametype called Invasion,\
      \ where these monsters simply attack the players in a succession of waves. However,\
      \ the UT2004 Invasion Monsters were not meant to be used in any other gametype\
      \ or in custom maps.</p>\n<p>This toolset redefines the available Monsters (and\
      \ their MonsterController) to mimic the original ScriptedPawn functionality\
      \ along with all the original unique monster behaviors and functionality. To\
      \ do this, a new Monster class (ScriptedMonster) and a new Controller class\
      \ (ScriptedMonsterController) work in concert with several recreated UT Actors\
      \ to provide the same sophisticated toolset that the early versions of Unreal\
      \ had.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is twofold. First, to restore the Monsters\
      \ to their original state, with all the properties, Orders, states and behaviors\
      \ that mappers of early versions of Unreal will recognize. Second, to further\
      \ these Monster's behaviors, components and attributes, where appropriate and\
      \ in line with the original flavor of the Monsters. All of the new Monsters\
      \ re-enable animations that are available in UT2004, but are unused in Invasion.\
      \ Some Monsters are recreated variations of existing Invasion Monsters. Most\
      \ of the new Monsters have re-introduced properties and behaviors along with\
      \ some new complementary behaviors.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\

      \ the behavior and capabilities of UT2004 Invasion monsters so that they may\
      \ be placed and set up to perform complex actions. They are an attempt to restore\
      \ the abilities of Unreal's old ScriptedPawn.</p>\n<p>For a detailed reference\

      Edit section: ScriptedMonster Orders and states\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The Orders property is one of the most powerful \"\
      new\" Old Skool Monster features. In conjunction with the OrderTag, other properties\
      \ and other actors, the Orders property can dramatically change the way ScriptedMonsters\
      \ behave in your map. Here are some of the available valid Orders:</p>\n<dl>\n\
      <dt>Waiting&#160;</dt>\n<dd>(default) Wander or Camp nearby the placed spot\
      \ until an Enemy is detected. Attack and freely roam afterwards.</dd>\n<dt>Ambushing&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Travel to an AmbushPoint (or spawn at one at map start) whose Tag matches\
      \ OrderTag, wait for an Enemy, then Attack. Find another AmbushPoint after combat\
      \ and wait again.</dd>\n<dt>Guarding&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Guard an actor whose Tag\
      \ matches OrderTag. They will remain near and return to their placed spot after\
      \ combat.</dd>\n<dt>Patroling&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Travel from one PatrolPoint (or\
      \ spawn at one at map start) whose Tag matches OrderTag to the NextPatrol in\
      \ a series, leave for combat and return to patrol after combat.</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <p>Other behaviors ScriptedMonsters will automatically demonstrate include the\
      \ Retreating state, where hurt (and afraid) monsters will flee to a HomeBase\
      \ whose Tag matches the monster's Tag, and the Alarm states (TriggerAlarm and\
      \ AlarmPaused), where an \"alarmed\" monster (one who has seen an Enemy for\
      \ the first time) moves to an AlarmPoint, whose Tag matches the monster's AlarmTag,\
      \ at all costs and possibly shoot a target, activate a trigger, etc.</p>\n<p>In\
      \ addition to these general behaviors, individual monsters may also have special\
      \ Orders or behaviors. A couple examples include, the Krall which have a \"\
      Sleeping\" Order that can be used in conjunction with one of the sleeping animations\
      \ set in the StartingAnim property, and the Warlord has a \"Mutilating\" Order\
      \ that will cause the Warlord to continually kick, punch and munch on a long\
      \ dead carcass until an Enemy is seen.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ have Skill and Intelligence properties. The Skill set on creature will be\
      \ added to the starting game difficulty to make them greater at combat tactics.\
      \ The Intelligence can rank from Amoeba (or insect-like) to Human. More intelligent\
      \ creatures have the ability remember Player positions longer as well as take\
      \ advantage of various abilities. ScriptedMonsters also make use of a property,\
      \ AttitudeToPlayer, to allow more flexibility to the mapper in terms of setting\
      \ up complex behavior. The Attitudes a creature can have toward players can\
      \ vary from Fear to Hate to Ignore to Friendly and even Follow. Friendly and\
      \ Following creatures will greet players in some way instead of attacking. This\
      \ can change the Alarm behavior of creatures to lead Players to desirable items,\
      \ etc. More intelligent creatures set to Follow will then join the Player, following\
      \ them around, attacking those who their Leader attacks, threatening \"wild\"\
      \ creatures, etc. Although these creatures act a little like Players, they are\
      \ not Players, so they are not able to pickup items, drive vehicles, score points\
      \ or achieve game objectives.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"AI-Related_Actors\"\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>This toolset includes many ScriptedActions meant to\
      \ augment the AI system. If scripted behavior is desired over the AI system's\
      \ behaviors, such as situations like acting in a cutscene, or performing a specific\
      \ behavior repeatedly, the ScriptedActions <tt>ACTION_PossessPawn</tt> and <tt>ACTION_Monsterize</tt>\
      \ can allow ScriptedSequences to \"catch\" ScriptedMonsters, control them, then\
      \ \"release\" them back to a ScriptedMonsterController.</p>\n<p>Some of these\
      \ ScriptedActions are meant specifically for OSM Adventure, but plenty are useful\
      \ in other gametypes as well. Some are specifically used by ScriptedCharacters\
      \ to use vehicles, such as <tt>ACTION_TryToDrive</tt>, <tt>ACTION_VehicleFire</tt>\
      \ and <tt>ACTION_ExitVehicle</tt>. Other ScriptedActions of note are <tt>ACTION_AssignMonsterToTeam</tt>,\
      \ <tt>ACTION_SetOrders</tt> and the conditionals. (<tt>ACTION_If...</tt>)</p>\n\
      <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you go that route of possessing the NPC mid-game, use\
      \ the included Dummy Pawn as a placeholder for that NPC, by setting its AI-&gt;AIScriptTag\
      \ to the Tag of the ScriptedSequence. Otherwise, the ScriptedSequence will be\
      \ invalid and be removed at map start.) Remember, you can use <tt>ACTION_Monsterize</tt>\
      \ to return the NPC to \"normal\" control.</p>\n<p><i>Incidentally, this set\
      \ of ScriptedActions includes the original attempt to implement UT2004 Monsters\
      \ in non-Invasion gametypes. Together with the Dummy Pawn, they provided a rudimentary\
      \ method of spawning, controlling, unleashing and re-possessing Invasion Monsters.\
      \ This scheme originally used the standard Invasion Monsters and MonsterControllers,\
      \ but these ScriptedActions have been modified to work only with the new ScriptedMonster\
      \ and ScriptedMonsterController classes.</i></p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ just a closer and more detailed view of the item. If the player leaves the\
      \ radius or presses the Use key again, the HUD Overlay image is removed. Other\
      \ options can offer a hint to the player <i>(\"Hey! I'm a clue!\")</i> or toggle\
      \ the visibility off on the HintItem mesh itself, to further the illusion that\
      \ it is being held by the player. Sounds can also be set for both the pickup\

      <p>OSMT is a mapping toolset, but in following Epic's open-ended structure of\
      \ the Unreal Engine, it also allows mappers to expand on the toolset to create\
      \ brand new features, creatures and behaviors. The AI and tools available give\
      \ a solid foundation to add your own custom content, custom creatures, NPCs,\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Because ScriptedMonster allows for a wide variety\
      \ of behavior (friendly to players, intelligent, skillful, etc.), just by subclassing\
      \ it you get a good head start in creating a custom creature. You will need\
      \ to define standard properties and methods, such as the DeathAnim properties,\
      \ various sounds, Play(Behavior Anim) functions, etc. By taking a look at how\
      \ other creatures in this toolset were set up, you can get a good idea of what\
      \ you'll need. Does your custom creature fly? Take a look at SmartFly, SmartManta\
      \ or SmartWarlord.</p>\n<p>The foundation this toolset supplies is fairly complete,\
      \ allowing you to simply supply the artwork and decide how the stock AI should\
      \ behave. But, if you feel you need more than what ScriptedMonsters do normally,\
      \ you may want special behaviors for your particular custom creature.</p>\n\

      \ are base classes that allow you to build new creatures easily that will be\
      \ able to perform the basic behaviors (such as Patroling, Guarding, etc.) and\
      \ still have their own individual behaviors as well. The creatures in this toolset\
      \ also have individual behaviors, like the Krall DiceGames, Warlord Mutilating,\
      \ etc. This is achieved through special pawn-specific Orders (states) and a\
      \ simple mechanism in ScriptedMonster that checks to see if an Order is standard\
      \ or unique to that Pawn class.</p>\n<p>Just add an individual state to your\
      \ ScriptedMonster subclass. That state name is the Order you assign to send\
      \ it to that state at map start. It's pretty simple. Once the code recognizes\
      \ that pawn's individual behavior state, it will suspend the ScriptedMonsterController\
      \ in a \"PawnSpecific\" state, until the ScriptedMonster class relinquishes\
      \ control. This makes it easy to add new behaviors without modifying the Controller\

    text: "==Overview==\n\n'''Old Skool Monsta Toolz (OSMT)''' is a toolset for UT2004\
      \ that is designed to reintroduce old skool Unreal monster AI and it's related\
      \ actors for use in any gametype.  These tools mimic the original Unreal actors\
      \ and settings so that \"old timers\" can easily pick it up and \"newcomers\"\
      \ have lots of online reference documentation already available.  The toolset\
      \ also includes a new gametype, '''OSM Adventure (OSM)''', which makes use of\
      \ all classes in the toolset to facilitate story-driven adventures through progressive\
      \ Objectives comprised of puzzles, traps and monsters.  I humbly thank Steven\
      \ Polge and the rest of the team at Epic for the original design plan for the\
      \ AI.  This toolset is a loving adaptation of the original work.\n\nThe project's\
      \ aim is to allow UT2004 mappers to create maps that take advantage of this\
      \ well-designed AI scheme in any gametype, especially in story-driven adventures.\n\
      \n''As a side note, I'd like to mention that while I've been aware of Unreal\
      \ and UT for a long time and have become familiar with the original code through\
      \ UnrealWiki, I never had these games so I relied on online documentation and\
      \ second-hand accounts of the AI behavior and functionality to help develop\
      \ this toolset.'' &ndash; '''SuperApe'''\n\n==Latest Version==\n\nThe public\
      \ release version has been made available.  An OSM Adventure Map Pack will also\
      \ be available soon. \n\n===OSMT v1.53===\n\nThe UT2004 mapping toolset for\
      \ implementing old skool Unreal-style creature AI in any gametype.\n\n'''[http://www.moddb.com/mods/old-skool-monsta-toolz\
      \ OSMT_v1.53.zip]''' (~560k)\n\n'''''Update:''''' OSMT v1.53 is the final release.\
      \  See the included DevLog.txt for current details on this update.  All changes\
      \ are backwards compatible.\n\n===OSM Adventure Map Pack===\n\nA collection\
      \ of maps demonstrating a variety of story-driven adventures possible with the\
      \ OSM Adventure gametype.\n\n''An OSM Adventure Mapping Competition just finished\
      \ on UnrealPlayground Forums.  Once the judging is complete, all the entries\
      \ will be compiled and released as an OSM Adventure Map Pack.  You can keep\
      \ tabs on the progress on the '''[http://www.unrealplayground.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=172\
      \ Old Skool Monsta Toolz Subforum]'''.''\n\n==Known Bugs==\n\nAny official bugs\
      \ found (by SuperApe) with the current version are listed here, along with workarounds.\n\
      * UT2004 Invasion Monsters will conflict with these new monsters.  For that\
      \ reason, the Invasion gametype is not well-suited for custom maps that include\
      \ these monsters.\n* Some 3rd party weapons mutators (ones with weapons not\
      \ derived from the Weapon base class) do not spawn weapons from ThingFactory\
      \ actors.  No workaround.\n\n==The Toolset==\n\nThis is a package that includes\
      \ a full toolset for mappers to implement Old Skool-style Unreal Monsters in\
      \ maps.  In early versions of Unreal, the Monsters were a subclass of [[Legacy:ScriptedPawn|ScriptedPawn]],\
      \ an all-purpose scripted character class that contained sophisticated AI. \
      \ In later versions of Unreal, a new scheme split much of the functionality\
      \ of ScriptedPawns into Pawn and Controller classes.  In UT2004, some of the\
      \ original monster models were re-introduced in a gametype called Invasion,\
      \ where these monsters simply attack the players in a succession of waves. \
      \ However, the UT2004 Invasion Monsters were not meant to be used in any other\
      \ gametype or in custom maps.\n\nThis toolset redefines the available Monsters\
      \ (and their MonsterController) to mimic the original ScriptedPawn functionality\
      \ along with all the original unique monster behaviors and functionality.  To\
      \ do this, a new Monster class (ScriptedMonster) and a new Controller class\
      \ (ScriptedMonsterController) work in concert with several recreated UT Actors\
      \ to provide the same sophisticated toolset that the early versions of Unreal\
      \ had.\n\nThe goal of this project is twofold.  First, to restore the Monsters\
      \ to their original state, with all the properties, Orders, states and behaviors\
      \ that mappers of early versions of Unreal will recognize.  Second, to further\
      \ these Monster's behaviors, components and attributes, where appropriate and\
      \ in line with the original flavor of the Monsters.  All of the new Monsters\
      \ re-enable animations that are available in UT2004, but are unused in Invasion.\
      \  Some Monsters are recreated variations of existing Invasion Monsters.  Most\
      \ of the new Monsters have re-introduced properties and behaviors along with\
      \ some new complementary behaviors.\n\n===ScriptedMonster & ScriptedMonsterController===\n\
      \nThese two actors redefine the behavior and capabilities of UT2004 Invasion\
      \ monsters so that they may be placed and set up to perform complex actions.\
      \  They are an attempt to restore the abilities of Unreal's old ScriptedPawn.\n\
      \nFor a detailed reference on all ScriptedMonster classes, see [[User:SuperApe/OSMT_Monster_Manual|OSMT\
      \ Monster Manual]]\n\n====ScriptedMonster Orders and states====\n\nThe Orders\
      \ property is one of the most powerful \"new\" Old Skool Monster features. \
      \ In conjunction with the OrderTag, other properties and other actors, the Orders\
      \ property can dramatically change the way ScriptedMonsters behave in your map.\
      \  Here are some of the available valid Orders:\n\n; Waiting : (default) Wander\
      \ or Camp nearby the placed spot until an Enemy is detected.  Attack and freely\
      \ roam afterwards.\n; Ambushing : Travel to an AmbushPoint (or spawn at one\
      \ at map start) whose Tag matches OrderTag, wait for an Enemy, then Attack.\
      \  Find another AmbushPoint after combat and wait again.\n; Guarding : Guard\
      \ an actor whose Tag matches OrderTag.  They will remain near and return to\
      \ their placed spot after combat.\n; Patroling : Travel from one PatrolPoint\
      \ (or spawn at one at map start) whose Tag matches OrderTag to the NextPatrol\
      \ in a series, leave for combat and return to patrol after combat.\n\nOther\
      \ behaviors ScriptedMonsters will automatically demonstrate include the Retreating\
      \ state, where hurt (and afraid) monsters will flee to a HomeBase whose Tag\
      \ matches the monster's Tag, and the Alarm states (TriggerAlarm and AlarmPaused),\
      \ where an \"alarmed\" monster (one who has seen an Enemy for the first time)\
      \ moves to an AlarmPoint, whose Tag matches the monster's AlarmTag, at all costs\
      \ and possibly shoot a target, activate a trigger, etc.\n\nIn addition to these\
      \ general behaviors, individual monsters may also have special Orders or behaviors.\
      \  A couple examples include, the Krall which have a \"Sleeping\" Order that\
      \ can be used in conjunction with one of the sleeping animations set in the\
      \ StartingAnim property, and the Warlord has a \"Mutilating\" Order that will\
      \ cause the Warlord to continually kick, punch and munch on a long dead carcass\
      \ until an Enemy is seen.\n\n====ScriptedMonster Skill, Intelligence and AttitudeToPlayer====\n\
      \nScriptedMonsters have Skill and Intelligence properties.  The Skill set on\
      \ creature will be added to the starting game difficulty to make them greater\
      \ at combat tactics.  The Intelligence can rank from Amoeba (or insect-like)\
      \ to Human.  More intelligent creatures have the ability remember Player positions\
      \ longer as well as take advantage of various abilities.  ScriptedMonsters also\
      \ make use of a property, AttitudeToPlayer, to allow more flexibility to the\
      \ mapper in terms of setting up complex behavior.  The Attitudes a creature\
      \ can have toward players can vary from Fear to Hate to Ignore to Friendly and\
      \ even Follow.  Friendly and Following creatures will greet players in some\
      \ way instead of attacking.  This can change the Alarm behavior of creatures\
      \ to lead Players to desirable items, etc.  More intelligent creatures set to\
      \ Follow will then join the Player, following them around, attacking those who\
      \ their Leader attacks, threatening \"wild\" creatures, etc.  Although these\
      \ creatures act a little like Players, they are not Players, so they are not\
      \ able to pickup items, drive vehicles, score points or achieve game objectives.\n\
      \n===AI-Related Actors===\n\nA full set of actors is included that replicate\
      \ the support actors used in old skool Unreal AI.\n\n====Keypoints====\n; ThingFactory\
      \ : This keypoint is designed to spawn actors.  It can be set to spawn automatically\
      \ or by trigger.  Associate Thing and CreatureFactories to SpawnPoints by matching\
      \ their Tag values.  Up to 16 SpawnPoints can be associated to a Factory.\n\
      ; CreatureFactory : This is a variation of ThingFactory designed specifically\
      \ to spawn ScriptedMonsters.  Killing a creature spawned from this factory will\
      \ trigger another creature to be spawned automatically, if bAutoRespawn is True\
      \ and if it's Capacity hasn't been met.\n\n====NavPoints====\n; AlarmPoint :\
      \ This is a spot that an \"Alarmed\" creature (one who sees an Enemy) will move\
      \ to and Attack from.  It can be used to have the creature activate a trigger\
      \ when an Enemy is detected.\n; AmbushPoint : This is a spot that an Ambushing\
      \ creature will wait for an Enemy at.\n; GuardPoint : A spot to guard an item\
      \ from.  This actor is automatically placed by the Controller code and should\
      \ not be placed by the mapper.\n; HomeBase : This is a spot that a hurt or fearfull\
      \ creature will Retreat to.\n; PatrolPoint : This is a spot that a Patrolling\
      \ creature will move to, wait a bit and move from to the next PatrolPoint in\
      \ a series.\n; SpawnPoint : This is a spot that a ThingFactory or CreatureFactory\
      \ spawns things and creatures from.\n\n===Miscellaneous Objects===\n\nThis section\
      \ highlights some of the uniquely useful extras this toolset provides.\n\n====OSMT\
      \ ScriptedActions====\n\nThis toolset includes many ScriptedActions meant to\
      \ augment the AI system.  If scripted behavior is desired over the AI system's\
      \ behaviors, such as situations like acting in a cutscene, or performing a specific\
      \ behavior repeatedly, the ScriptedActions <tt>ACTION_PossessPawn</tt> and <tt>ACTION_Monsterize</tt>\
      \ can allow ScriptedSequences to \"catch\" ScriptedMonsters, control them, then\
      \ \"release\" them back to a ScriptedMonsterController.\n\nSome of these ScriptedActions\
      \ are meant specifically for OSM Adventure, but plenty are useful in other gametypes\
      \ as well.  Some are specifically used by ScriptedCharacters to use vehicles,\
      \ such as <tt>ACTION_TryToDrive</tt>, <tt>ACTION_VehicleFire</tt> and <tt>ACTION_ExitVehicle</tt>.\
      \  Other ScriptedActions of note are <tt>ACTION_AssignMonsterToTeam</tt>, <tt>ACTION_SetOrders</tt>\
      \ and the conditionals. (<tt>ACTION_If...</tt>)\n\n'''IMPORTANT:''' If you go\
      \ that route of possessing the NPC mid-game, use the included Dummy Pawn as\
      \ a placeholder for that NPC, by setting its AI->AIScriptTag to the Tag of the\
      \ ScriptedSequence. Otherwise, the ScriptedSequence will be invalid and be removed\
      \ at map start.) Remember, you can use <tt>ACTION_Monsterize</tt> to return\
      \ the NPC to \"normal\" control.\n\n''Incidentally, this set of ScriptedActions\
      \ includes the original attempt to implement UT2004 Monsters in non-Invasion\
      \ gametypes.  Together with the Dummy Pawn, they provided a rudimentary method\
      \ of spawning, controlling, unleashing and re-possessing Invasion Monsters.\
      \  This scheme originally used the standard Invasion Monsters and MonsterControllers,\
      \ but these ScriptedActions have been modified to work only with the new ScriptedMonster\
      \ and ScriptedMonsterController classes.''\n\n====HintItem====\n\nThis is an\
      \ actor that represents a hint, clue or item that can be held or inspected closer.\
      \  A player can enter it's collision radius and press the Use key to toggle\
      \ a HUD Overlay on, an image which is normally just a closer and more detailed\
      \ view of the item.  If the player leaves the radius or presses the Use key\
      \ again, the HUD Overlay image is removed.  Other options can offer a hint to\
      \ the player ''(\"Hey! I'm a clue!\")'' or toggle the visibility off on the\
      \ HintItem mesh itself, to further the illusion that it is being held by the\
      \ player.  Sounds can also be set for both the pickup and drop.\n\n====Poison\
      \ / Antedote====\n\nA poison system is included in OSMT allowing Poisoned damage,\
      \ PoisonPickups, AntedotePickups, and a PoisonTrigger.  Players will be drained\
      \ of health once per second as they see a faint green damage flash on their\
      \ HUD and their Pawns convulse.  Options include rate of damage and length of\
      \ time the poison lasts.\n\n====Triggers====\n\nA host of triggers are available\
      \ to help mappers.  The ExclusionTrigger allows a ClassProximity of all but\
      \ the configured subclasses, which can come in handy to detect xPawn that aren't\
      \ Monsters, for example.  The PlayerUseTrigger detects Human Player and Use\
      \ key presses, but ignores all others, such as Bots or Monsters.\n\n==Mapping\
      \ with OSMT==\n\nThe Old Skool Monsta Toolz can be used in '''any gametype'''.\
      \  However, it is up to the mapper / level designer to implement them in a way\
      \ that offers more interest and challenge to players, rather than serving to\
      \ frustrate and distract from player's enjoyment of the gametype.\n\n===Instructions===\n\
      \nUnless you edit your UT2004 configuration settings to include OSMT.u as an\
      \ editpackage ''(and if you don't know what I'm talking about, don't do it)'',\
      \ you will need to open OSMT.u through your Actor Browser in Ued '''each time\
      \ to you open Ued''', to have the full list of Old Skool Monsta Toolz components\
      \ available to work with.  Once you've opened OSMT.u, you will be able to add\
      \ OSMT components to your map, configure them and save.\n\n===Quick Start===\n\
      \nFollow the instructions on the ReadMe.txt file to install OSMT.  Launch Ued\
      \ and use the Actor Browser to open the OSMT.u package file.  Expand the class\
      \ heirarchy for the ScriptedMonster parent class: Pawn -> UnrealPawn -> xPawn\
      \ -> Monster -> ScriptedMonster.  Select any of the available OSMT creatures,\
      \ then place it in the map by clicking on a spot on the ground in the perspective\
      \ viewport and using the rick-click menu to \"Place <your selected class> Here\"\
      .  You can then playtest it by hitting the Playtest button, which looks like\
      \ a joystick.  Now back in Ued, you can begin to tweak the properties, follow\
      \ the [[Legacy:Basic ScriptedPawn Tutorial|Basic ScriptedPawn Tutorial]] to\
      \ explore other behavior, test out the other creatures, and start to use more\
      \ and more of the included components ''(See OSMT Class Tree below)'', or even\
      \ the try your hand at the OSM Adventure gametype.\n\n===Guidelines===\n\nUnless\
      \ the ScriptedAction ACTION_AssignMonsterToTeam is used or AttitudeToPlayer\
      \ is set to make creatures follow and fight alongside a player, be aware that\
      \ monsters will attack all players equally.  In general, the monsters should\
      \ be used to guard powerful alternative items or routes to game objectives,\
      \ rather than to guard the game objectives themselves.  Be aware that gametypes\
      \ that allow vehicles are inheritently more dangerous for players and monsters\
      \ alike.  Most monsters are no match for vehicle weaponry and should be appropriately\
      \ supported against players with vehicles.\n\n==The OSM Adventure Gametype==\n\
      \nThe OSM Adventure gametype is a story-driven gametype that can create single\
      \ player or cooperative adventures in UT2004. It is designed for players to\
      \ \"run the gauntlet\" among monsters, traps and puzzles to get to the end and\
      \ win. They are given a limited number of lives, an optional timelimit, but\
      \ no goal (score) limit.\n\nSee also [[User:SuperApe/Mapping_For_OSM_Adventure|Mapping\
      \ for OSM Adventure]].\n\n==Tweaking OSMT==\n\nOSMT is a mapping toolset, but\
      \ in following Epic's open-ended structure of the Unreal Engine, it also allows\
      \ mappers to expand on the toolset to create brand new features, creatures and\
      \ behaviors.  The AI and tools available give a solid foundation to add your\
      \ own custom content, custom creatures, NPCs, behaviors, etc.\n\n===Custom Creatures===\n\
      \nBecause ScriptedMonster allows for a wide variety of behavior (friendly to\
      \ players, intelligent, skillful, etc.), just by subclassing it you get a good\
      \ head start in creating a custom creature.  You will need to define standard\
      \ properties and methods, such as the DeathAnim properties, various sounds,\
      \ Play(Behavior Anim) functions, etc.  By taking a look at how other creatures\
      \ in this toolset were set up, you can get a good idea of what you'll need.\
      \  Does your custom creature fly?  Take a look at SmartFly, SmartManta or SmartWarlord.\n\
      \nThe foundation this toolset supplies is fairly complete, allowing you to simply\
      \ supply the artwork and decide how the stock AI should behave.  But, if you\
      \ feel you need more than what ScriptedMonsters do normally, you may want special\
      \ behaviors for your particular custom creature.\n\n===Custom Orders (Behavior\
      \ States)===\n\nScriptedMonster and ScriptedMonsterController are base classes\
      \ that allow you to build new creatures easily that will be able to perform\
      \ the basic behaviors (such as Patroling, Guarding, etc.) and still have their\
      \ own individual behaviors as well.  The creatures in this toolset also have\
      \ individual behaviors, like the Krall DiceGames, Warlord Mutilating, etc. \
      \ This is achieved through special pawn-specific Orders (states) and a simple\
      \ mechanism in ScriptedMonster that checks to see if an Order is standard or\
      \ unique to that Pawn class.\n\nJust add an individual state to your ScriptedMonster\
      \ subclass.  That state name is the Order you assign to send it to that state\
      \ at map start.  It's pretty simple.  Once the code recognizes that pawn's individual\
      \ behavior state, it will suspend the ScriptedMonsterController in a \"PawnSpecific\"\
      \ state, until the ScriptedMonster class relinquishes control.  This makes it\
      \ easy to add new behaviors without modifying the Controller class.\n\n===Custom\
      \ Games===\n\nCustom gametypes, game prototypes and game styles, can be developed\
      \ using OSMT as a base, but only with expressed permission by me ''(please contact\
      \ me for permission to use OSMT as a base for your mod)'', which I usually give\
      \ with just a request to be credited properly, etc.  While adding on top of\
      \ OSMT may be allowed, changing or duplicating the code will not be.  For more\
      \ infomation, please refer to my Legal Info below.\n\nWhether you're developing\
      \ your own game demo and need a base for your custom content (creatures, cinematics,\
      \ etc) or you're changing the whole style of Unreal gameplay from a first person\
      \ shooter to something very different, such as a platformer, a racing game or\
      \ what have you, Old Skool Monsta Toolz can help to deal with NPC/Monster AI\
      \ and serve as the foundation of some of the common related gameplay features.\n\
      \n==Distributing Guidelines==\n\nMappers are free to use these tools and the\
      \ components in their custom maps.  However, the complete OSMT.zip file, *must*\
      \ be included in the distribution of that custom map.  In addition, I give permission\
      \ for mappers to use these tools in their custom map if they will also please\
      \ credit me in their own ReadMe file for that custom map.\n\nTo use this toolset,\
      \ simply install the package file in your .../UT2004/System directory.  In Ued,\
      \ you will be able to open the OSMT.u package file from the Actor browser. \
      \ Once the package has been opened, all the toolset actors will be available\
      \ to add to your custom map.\n\n'''''Warning''''': Any map that uses the components\
      \ found in this toolset *must* be able to access to the OSMT.u, OSMT.ucl and\
      \ OSMTex.utx package files or the map will fail to load properly.  Do not attempt\
      \ to distribute a custom map with these components without the OSMT .zip file\
      \ and installation instuctions or you will get complaints by end users that\
      \ your map won't load.\n\n===Map Distribution===\n\nYour custom map should always\
      \ be distributed with a ReadMe.txt file.  In that file, along with map information,\
      \ your information, etc., you should always include installation instuctions.\
      \  To make distribution easier to remember and to avoid confusion by keeping\
      \ OSMT elements separate from your map components, just add the OSMT .zip file\
      \ to your map's .zip file.  Below is an example set of instructions that include\
      \ installation of the required OSMT package files, so that your custom map will\
      \ run properly on the end user's machine.\n\n====Example Installation Instructions====\n\
      \nFor the custom map named, \"DM-Foo.ut2\":\n# Unzip \"DM-Foo.zip\".\n# Place\
      \ \"DM-Foo.ut2\" in your .../UT2004/Maps directory.\n# Unzip \"OSMT_v1.53.zip\"\
      \ (or whichever version you include)\n# Place \"OSMT.u\" and \"OSMT.ucl\" in\
      \ your .../UT2004/System directory.\n# Place \"OSMTex.utx\" in your .../UT2004/Textures\
      \ directory.\n# Place \"Flashlight.usx\" in your .../UT2004/StaticMeshes directory.\n\
      \n==OSMT Class Tree (v1.53)==\n\nThis tree lists the classes available in the\
      \ OSMT toolset.  Exclusive OSMT objects are '''bolded'''.  UT-related classes\
      \ are linked, although some differences may exist.\n\n'''''NOTE:''''' If you\
      \ ''don't'' see everything on this list in your UnrealEd session, simply re-open\
      \ OSMT.u from your Actor Browser.  A more permanent fix is available by editing\
      \ your UT2004.ini, but it is recommended for advanced users only.\n  (Object)\n\

      \n==Discussion==\n\n'''SuperApe:''' I have an example map available to test\
      \ out the new gametype included in this toolset.  Available on UnrealPlayground\
      \ [http://www.unrealplayground.com/maps.php?mapid=11599 here].  Enjoy! :)\n\n\
      '''SuperApe:''' I've made another OSM Adventure map to help level designers\
      \ see how the various OSMT elements are used.  The map, [http://unrealtournament2004.filefront.com/file/OSM_Guide;70724\
      \ OSM-Guide], is meant to be reverse-engineered in UnrealEd and it includes\
      \ many Note actors couple with various OSM Adventure elements to help demonstrate\
      \ the concepts involved.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' OSMT v1.4 released.  All changes\
      \ are backwards compatible.\n\n'''SuperApe:''' OSMT v1.53 has been released.\
      \ This is the final release.  All changes are backwards compatible.\n\n'''SuperApe:'''\
