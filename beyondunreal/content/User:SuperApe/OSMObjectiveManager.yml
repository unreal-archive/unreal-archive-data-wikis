      \ the level designer can set are <b>optional</b>.</li>\n<li>It is not necessary\
      \ for Triggers that fire Objective AchieveEvents to be set to bTriggerOnceOnly.\
      \ OSMObjectiveManager automatically spawns OSMObjectiveTriggers at the start\
      \ of the match for each Objective for this purpose.</li>\n<li>As long as the\
      \ Objective cutscene is started by the OSMObjectiveManager, the player's Pawn\
      \ will be controlled during the cutscene by the ScriptedSequence whose Tag matches\
      \ the Matinee's (SceneManager) PlayerScriptTag property. <i>(This corrects a\
      \ small bug in the stock code that prevented this operation)</i></li>\n<li>In\
      \ order for the player's Pawn to be controlled by the appropriate ScriptedSequence\
      \ identified by the Matinee (SceneManager), or for score or Adrenline to be\
      \ awarded appropriately, the Objective's AchieveEvent <b>must</b> be Instigated\
      \ by the player Pawn. For more on Trigger System Instigators, see <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Trigger_Systems\" title=\"Legacy:Trigger Systems\">Trigger Systems</a>.</li>\n\
      <li>Player's who die during cutscenes are automatically revived after the cutscene\
      \ is done.</li>\n<li>While IntroCutScenes can be interrupted (if configured\
      \ by the level designer), both intermediate Objective cutscenes and DeathScenes\
      \ are not interruptable. Level designers are encouraged to keep these short\
      \ and to the point for the sake of the player's patience.</li>\n<li>If an IntroCutScne\
      \ is interrupted the OSMGame actor fires a special Event meant to signal that\
      \ the intro cutscene is over and the match is about to begin. This Event, \"\
      IntroInterrupted\", is mean to help level designers clean up intro cutscene\
      \ actors and move appropriate Movers to get ready for the start of the match.</li>\n\
      <li>While Match TimeLimits set by the player in the game config menu will time\
      \ the entire adventure, including the time cutscenes take, Per-Objective TimeLimits\
      \ as defined by the level designer in the OSMObjectiveManager do not count the\
      \ time taken during cutscenes. Per-Objective TimeLimits begin <i>after</i> the\
      \ cutscene is finished and end <i>before</i> the start of the next Objective's\
      \ cutscene.</li>\n<li>Adrenaline combos interrupted by cutscenes will be automatically\
      \ continued after the cutscene ends.</li>\n<li>If Adrenaline is not desired\
      \ in this map, simply use a LevelGameRules actor set to the NoAdrenaline mutator.</li>\n\
      <li>DeathScenes are simply Matinees. If a DeathSceneTag matches a Matinee (SceneManager)\
      \ Tag, that DeathScene will run whenever the player dies.</li>\n<li>A DeathScene\
      \ always centers on the player Pawn or the Pawn's last location if gibbed.</li>\n\
      <li>DeathScenes have their camera locked at a distance of about 256 UU automatically,\
      \ so the DeathScene Matinee is simply used to provide camera angle motion.</li>\n\
      <li>DeathScenes are always in \"BulletTime\".</li>\n<li>DeathScenes can utilize\
      \ all Matinee features, including camera effects and camera overlays. A special\
      \ bloody \"You Died\" texture is provided by this actor's Skins property. It\
      \ is available under the OSMTex texture package for use as a stock DeathScene\

      \ Pawn.\n\n==Operation, Rules & Tips==\n* It's important to note that each of\
      \ these properties the level designer can set are '''optional'''.\n* It is not\
      \ necessary for Triggers that fire Objective AchieveEvents to be set to bTriggerOnceOnly.\
      \  OSMObjectiveManager automatically spawns OSMObjectiveTriggers at the start\
      \ of the match for each Objective for this purpose.\n* As long as the Objective\
      \ cutscene is started by the OSMObjectiveManager, the player's Pawn will be\
      \ controlled during the cutscene by the ScriptedSequence whose Tag matches the\
      \ Matinee's (SceneManager) PlayerScriptTag property. ''(This corrects a small\
      \ bug in the stock code that prevented this operation)''\n* In order for the\
      \ player's Pawn to be controlled by the appropriate ScriptedSequence identified\
      \ by the Matinee (SceneManager), or for score or Adrenline to be awarded appropriately,\
      \ the Objective's AchieveEvent '''must''' be Instigated by the player Pawn.\
      \  For more on Trigger System Instigators, see [[Legacy:Trigger Systems|Trigger\
      \ Systems]].\n* Player's who die during cutscenes are automatically revived\
      \ after the cutscene is done.\n* While IntroCutScenes can be interrupted (if\
      \ configured by the level designer), both intermediate Objective cutscenes and\
      \ DeathScenes are not interruptable.  Level designers are encouraged to keep\
      \ these short and to the point for the sake of the player's patience.\n* If\
      \ an IntroCutScne is interrupted the OSMGame actor fires a special Event meant\
      \ to signal that the intro cutscene is over and the match is about to begin.\
      \  This Event, \"IntroInterrupted\", is mean to help level designers clean up\
      \ intro cutscene actors and move appropriate Movers to get ready for the start\
      \ of the match.\n* While Match TimeLimits set by the player in the game config\
      \ menu will time the entire adventure, including the time cutscenes take, Per-Objective\
      \ TimeLimits as defined by the level designer in the OSMObjectiveManager do\
      \ not count the time taken during cutscenes.  Per-Objective TimeLimits begin\
      \ ''after'' the cutscene is finished and end ''before'' the start of the next\
      \ Objective's cutscene.\n* Adrenaline combos interrupted by cutscenes will be\
      \ automatically continued after the cutscene ends.\n* If Adrenaline is not desired\
      \ in this map, simply use a LevelGameRules actor set to the NoAdrenaline mutator.\n\
      * DeathScenes are simply Matinees.  If a DeathSceneTag matches a Matinee (SceneManager)\
      \ Tag, that DeathScene will run whenever the player dies.\n* A DeathScene always\
      \ centers on the player Pawn or the Pawn's last location if gibbed.\n* DeathScenes\
      \ have their camera locked at a distance of about 256 UU automatically, so the\
      \ DeathScene Matinee is simply used to provide camera angle motion.\n* DeathScenes\
      \ are always in \"BulletTime\".\n* DeathScenes can utilize all Matinee features,\
      \ including camera effects and camera overlays.  A special bloody \"You Died\"\
      \ texture is provided by this actor's Skins property.  It is available under\
      \ the OSMTex texture package for use as a stock DeathScene camera overlay.\n\
