      <p>OSM Adventure is a very versatile gametype that can be used to create adventures\
      \ similar to a wide variety of other popular video games genres; dungeon crawlers,\
      \ platformers, exploration games, etc. Level designers can very easily create\
      \ simple single player or cooperative adventures with just a few added tools\
      \ to a simple map. But the scope of the kind of adventure you can make is limited\
      \ only by your imagination and your ability to implement custom content, such\
      \ as custom player models, creatures, etc.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Unlike all other UT2004 gametypes, OSM Adventure is\
      \ meant to be driven by a story. Players will <i>play</i> the story as they\
      \ progress through the map or series of maps. As such, OSM Adventures should\
      \ follow a storyline with a Beginning, Middle and End. To help tell the story\
      \ and allow players to immerse themselves in it, OSM Adventure takes advantage\
      \ of Matinee cinematics, progressive Objectives and other tools available from\
      \ OSMT. The very first thing an OSM Adventure level designer should do is consider\
      \ a storyline that would be fun to play through. You can find some inspiration\
      \ and development tips for your story at the External Links section at the bottom\
      \ of this page.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Design_Considerations\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Design Considerations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Players should start out with a limited number of\
      \ weapons and other powerup items at their disposal. The advercity they face\
      \ should be likewise limited. As they progress, the monsters, traps and puzzles\
      \ can get more difficult and the powerups and items they find can get more powerful\
      \ to help them. At various stages within the map, after the player has achieved\
      \ some goal, they should be allowed to start from that point, as opposed to\
      \ starting fromt the beginning again. Monsters, traps and puzzles should be\
      \ combined to offer more variety, in other words, a simple trap often seems\
      \ \"unfair\" to players, however a trap that is combined with a puzzle or a\
      \ monster can be more interesting. At the end of an adventure, use an OSMEndGameTrigger\
      \ to end the map, either by leading the player to touch it or by using another\
      \ trigger system (that the player instigates) to trigger it.</p>\n<p>See also\

      \ intro matinee cutscene for the map as well as intermediate cutscenes for each\
      \ objective, if desired. Set up Matinee cutscenes as normal. The OSMObjectiveManager\
      \ holds a series of optional properties for each Objective, including their\
      \ ScoringValue, AdrenalineAward, PlayerStartTag (see below), NextObjectiveTimelimit\
      \ and CutSceneTag. There is an additional option to display the CutScene for\
      \ that objective in \"Bullet Time\". These Objectives can only be triggered\
      \ once and the trigger should be instigated by the player, either directly or\
      \ indirectly, to ensure adrenaline award, etc. The Objectives can be reached\
      \ in any order.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"/User:SuperApe/OSMObjectiveManager\"\

      \ title=\"Legacy:TriggeredPlayerStart\" class=\"mw-redirect\">TriggeredPlayerStarts</a>\
      \ that will be triggered on/off as the player progresses through the level.\
      \ An OSMObjectiveManager can handle the toggling of these playerstarts for each\

      \ are <a href=\"/Legacy:Matinee\" title=\"Legacy:Matinee\">Matinees</a> used\
      \ during OSM play to give the Player important information about their place\
      \ in the adventure. It's good to keep Players informed as they begin their adventure,\
      \ are challenged by problems, achieve various goals and finish. No cutscenes\
      \ run during online play, so Players should be given some clue as to their progress\
      \ and their next objective even without them. Cutscene Matinees are set up as\
      \ normal, via the Matinee gui and using the <a href=\"/Legacy:SceneManager\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:SceneManager\">SceneManager</a> actor. Aside from the IntroCutScene,\
      \ which has it's own IntroCutSceneTag and IntroCutSceneLength properties in\
      \ OSMObjectiveManager, all cutscenes are set to launch from the OSMObjectiveManager\
      \ through it's Objectives array. All cutscenes must be launched by the OSMObjectiveManager;\
      \ do not launch them from another trigger system. The Player's Pawn can be controlled\
      \ during a cutscene by simply setting up a <a href=\"/Legacy:ScriptedSequence\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:ScriptedSequence\">ScriptedSequence</a> to control the pawn,\
      \ and matching the Tag of the script to the PlayerScriptTag property on the\
      \ SceneManager. As long as the cutscene is launched from the OSMObjectiveManager,\
      \ it will force the script to control the Player's Pawn during the scene. Be\
      \ careful not to let the Pawn script last longer than the length of the cutscene.\
      \ The Intro can also include the Player's Pawn (even though it is not in game\
      \ yet) by placing a ScriptedCharacter to control and giving it the Tag of \"\
      IntroCutScenePawn\". Most all ScriptedActions can be used to control the Player's\
      \ pawn, such as SetViewTarget, Run, Crouch, Walk, ShootTarget, etc. For proper\
      \ operation online, remember never to trigger gameplay critical events from\
      \ either the SceneManager or the Pawn's script because Cutscenes do not run\
      \ online. Use a ScriptedTrigger for those instead. DeathScenes are just cutscenes\
      \ that the OSMObjectiveManager will automatically run at death. Just create\
      \ a simple, short cutscene and match the Tag of to the OSMObjectiveManager's\
      \ DeathSceneTag property. DeathScenes are automatically set to BulletTime and\
      \ they will be set to a fixed distance from the Player pawn, so your DeathScene\
      \ movement should only be controlling the angle of view.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>What is OSM?</b></p>\n<p>OSM Adventure is a new\
      \ gametype that the OSMT toolset brings. It is designed to lead players to \"\
      Run the gauntlet of monsters, puzzles and traps.\" It is also a gametype that\
      \ lends itself to telling a story. Along with the use of cutscenes, special\
      \ effects, and the improved AI of the monsters, this gametype should set itself\
      \ apart from all others and offer players unique gameplay experiences.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Is this a SinglePlayer gametype or Cooperative?</b></p>\n<p>Both. OSM\
      \ Adventure was originally designed to be a SinglePlayer, offline-only gametype,\
      \ but has since evolved to an online-capable gametype that allows more than\
      \ one human player. The mapper decides how many MaxPlayers their map will hold\
      \ and designs the level accordingly.</p>\n<p><b>How do I start mapping for OSM\
      \ Adventure?</b></p>\n<p>Read the section on <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
      \ text\" href=\"http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/User:SuperApe/Old_Skool_Monsta_Toolz#Mapping_with_OSMT\"\
      >Old Skool Monsta Toolz</a> <b>Mapping with OSMT&#160;: Quick Start</b> to set\
      \ up Ued with OSMT and begin to use it in your custom map. Map as normal, but\
      \ use LevelProperties -&gt; DefaultGametype <tt>OSMT.OSMGame</tt>.</p>\n<p><b>What\
      \ theme should my OSM map be?</b></p>\n<p>Literally any theme, any environment,\
      \ any setting, any time, any place. This gametype is the premiere storytelling\
      \ gametype, so imagination should reign supreme.</p>\n<p><b>How do I set up\
      \ a story for my OSM map?</b></p>\n<p>Concentrate on telling a good story, or\
      \ rather, having the player <i>play</i> a good story. Start them off in some\
      \ minor conflict, give them small Objectves to achieve. As they progress, ramp\
      \ up the challenges, make things harder. Likewise, as they achieve more, give\
      \ them more pieces to the puzzle of the story, give them more to work with to\
      \ achieve the next goals. In the end, tie all the questions and conflicts of\
      \ your story together into one final conflict or problem to solve. Make this\
      \ final conflict the biggest. Once that is achieved, give the player a quick\
      \ but satisfying resolution to the whole conflict or puzzle of the story and\
      \ end it. For more on storytelling, search the web, there's plenty. Also check\
      \ out the Story Structure links at the bottom of this page.</p>\n<p><b>Do I\
      \ need to have Monsters, Traps and Puzzles?</b></p>\n<p>You do not really need\
      \ each of these, but this is what sets OSM apart from other gametypes. It is\
      \ highly recommended that you combine these elements, so that a trap is combined\
      \ with a puzzle, a puzzle with a monster, etc. This makes their encounter more\
      \ interesting and enjoyable for the player.</p>\n<p><b>How do I set up complex\
      \ Monster behavior?</b></p>\n<p>Very complex monster behavior is possible with\
      \ OSMT. This toolset is meant to mimic the old skool-style monster support that\
      \ UT and Unreal gave. That means old-timers will recognize this stuff right\
      \ away, but it also means there's plenty of info already on the 'net to help.\
      \ For a quick tutorial, see <a href=\"/Legacy:Basic_ScriptedPawn_Tutorial\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Basic ScriptedPawn Tutorial\">Basic ScriptedPawn Tutorial</a>.\
      \ Steven Polge's <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://unreal.epicgames.com/AI.htm\"\
      >Unreal Creature Care and Feeding Guide</a> is also a great resource. See also\
      \ the included Manual.</p>\n<p><b>What if I also want to have \"scripted\" behavior,\
      \ as in ScriptedSequences?</b></p>\n<p>OSMT includes two key ScriptedActions,\
      \ <tt>ACTION_PossessPawn</tt> and <tt>ACTION_Monsterize</tt>, that can \"catch\
      \ and release\" NPC ScriptedMonsters. Either in a cutscene or in mid-game, you\
      \ can have a ScriptedSequence possess a ScriptedMonster, control it and later\
      \ monsterize it, to return control back to a ScriptedMonsterController. <b>Important:</b>\
      \ If you go that route of possessing the NPC mid-game, use the included Dummy\
      \ Pawn as a placeholder for that NPC, by setting its AI-&gt;AIScriptTag to the\
      \ Tag of the ScriptedSequence. Otherwise, the ScriptedSequence will be invalid\
      \ and be removed at map start.</p>\n<p><b>What are the available animations\
      \ for these creatures?</b></p>\n<p>OSMT creatures make use of the included UT2004\
      \ Invasion creature vertex mesh animations. To view these, you can use the <a\
      \ href=\"/Legacy:Mesh_Browser\" title=\"Legacy:Mesh Browser\">Mesh Browser</a>.\
      \ <i>(see <a href=\"/Legacy:Toolbar\" title=\"Legacy:Toolbar\">Toolbar</a> for\
      \ a picture of the \"eye\" button)</i> In UT2004, this browser does seem to\
      \ have a display bug, where if a Vertex Mesh actor is in the map space already,\
      \ none of the meshes display in the Mesh Browser. So to view these animations,\
      \ it's usually best to simply open a fresh UnrealEd session and then open the\
      \ Mesh Browser.</p>\n<p><b>Do I need Bot Support in an OSM map?</b></p>\n<p>It\
      \ may sound strange to have <a href=\"/Legacy:Bot_Support\" title=\"Legacy:Bot\
      \ Support\">Bot Support</a> in a SinglePlayer map, but yes you need to have\
      \ a botpath network in place in order to allow proper Monster navigation. Monsters\
      \ use the same navigation actors as bots. The UnrealWiki is again a good place\
      \ to get info, as is <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://blitz.unrealplayground.com/tutorials/bots.html\"\
      >Blitz's Advanced Bot Pathing Tutorial</a>.</p>\n<p><b>How do I set up Puzzles\
      \ or Traps?</b></p>\n<p>There is no simple tutorial to make these things as\
      \ they should be completely unique to your map. Liberal use of <a href=\"/Legacy:Mover\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mover\">Movers</a> and <a href=\"/Legacy:Trigger_Systems\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Trigger Systems\">Trigger Systems</a> is what makes these things\
      \ work. The UnrealWiki can help with a lot of the issues you may run into. By\
      \ in large, Puzzles will be far more complex, but IMO far more satisfying to\
      \ players. Try to combine these elements (monsters, puzzles and traps) together\
      \ in different ways to make things a bit more interesting.</p>\n<p><b>How can\
      \ I detect when a group of creatures are dead or when an area is cleared of\
      \ monsters?</b></p>\n<p>A group of creatures can be set with a common Event\
      \ that will trigger a Counter. When the counter reaches the number of creatures\
      \ in that group, the Counter will fire. If you don't know the number of monsters,\
      \ but need to know if the player is alone, use the included PlayerAloneTrigger,\
      \ which will only fire if only the player and friendly creatures are within\
      \ its collision cylinder.</p>\n<p><b>How does the player win?</b></p>\n<p>A\
      \ player wins an OSM map when they've achieved a final goal the mapper has set.\
      \ In technical terms, an OSMEndGameTrigger is used to signal to the OSMGame\
      \ that the player has won. This trigger can be Touched by the player Pawn or\
      \ Triggered.</p>\n<p><b>How do I set up Objectives?</b></p>\n<p>Using an <a\
      \ href=\"/User:SuperApe/OSMObjectiveManager\" title=\"User:SuperApe/OSMObjectiveManager\"\
      >OSMObjectveManager</a> simplifies most of it. You can concentrate on the points\
      \ of your story, the level, the things the player needs to achieve. Then, set\
      \ a Trigger for each of those Objectives to go off when the player achieves\
      \ them. That trigger is used to signal to the OSMObjectiveManager that they've\
      \ done it, to signal a cutscene (to tell the player they've done it), toggle\
      \ new PlayerStarts, give a Score or Adrenaline award, start a timelimit to reach\
      \ the next Objective, etc. Just make sure the trigger is somehow Instigated\
      \ by the player so they are properly awarded points, etc. That's pretty much\
      \ it.</p>\n<p><b>How do I set up a player script to run during a cutscene?</b></p>\n\
      <p>You can easily control the player's pawn during your Objective cutscenes.\
      \ The SceneManager already has a PlayerScriptTag property to match to your AIScript's\
      \ Tag. Unfortunately, the stock code for this doesn't work. But as long as you\
      \ have an OSMObjectiveManager starting the scene, it will force it to work for\
      \ you. You need to use a ScriptedSequence and match the Tag to the PlayerScriptTag\
      \ property for your cutscene, do not use an UnrealScriptedSequence for this\
      \ purpose. You can set the ControllerClass to either None or ScriptedController,\
      \ do not use an AIController for this purpose. You can do many of the <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:ScriptedAction\" title=\"Legacy:ScriptedAction\">ScriptedActions</a>\
      \ in your script, including SetViewActor, MoveToPoint, Crouch, Walk, PlaySound,\
      \ PlayAnimation, etc. You can use the ScriptedSequence itself as the target\
      \ for a MoveToPoint or SetViewTarget action. <i>Be very careful not to let the\
      \ script run longer than the cutscene.</i> Test your cutscene with many variations\
      \ on player position and status to make sure everything works. Note: Online\
      \ games omit all cutscenes.</p>\n<p><b>How do I set up a custom DeathScene?</b></p>\n\
      <p>A DeathScene is just another matinee cutscene. It will be played upon player\
      \ death as long as you match the DeathSceneTag property on the OSMObjectiveManager\
      \ to the Tag of the DeathScene matinee. DeathScenes are always played in BulletTime.\
      \ It's a good idea to signal to the player they have died. For that purpose,\
      \ a \"YouDied\" texture is included in the OSMTex texture package for the purposes\
      \ of a CameraOverlay. Note that the distance from camera to carcass is locked\
      \ and doesn't change, although the camera angle will according to your custom\
      \ DeathScene matinee. Note: Online games omit DeathScenes.</p>\n<p><b>Are vehicles\
      \ allowed? Translocators?</b></p>\n<p>Yes, vehicles are allowed by default.\
      \ Included in the toolset is the <a href=\"/Open_Source/TeamVehicleFactory\"\
      \ title=\"Open Source/TeamVehicleFactory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">TeamVehicleFactory</a>,\
      \ but you can also use an ONS factory or those made for VCTF. By default, no\
      \ translocators are available in OSM, however if you want them in your map,\
      \ just add a NewWeaponPickup and set Pickup -&gt; PowerUp to \"Transpickup\"\
      .</p>\n<p><b>Can I get ScriptedCharacters to drive/ride in vehicles or use a\
      \ turret?</b></p>\n<p>ScriptedCharacter subclasses can use vehicles or turrets\
      \ via ScriptedSequences and included ScriptedActions such as <tt>ACTION_TryToDrive</tt>,\
      \ <tt>ACTION_ExitVehicle</tt>, <tt>ACTION_VehicleFire</tt>, etc. Once driving,\
      \ they can be directed to <tt>ACTION_MoveToPoint</tt> to go places or <tt>ACTION_SetViewTarget</tt>\
      \ to aim at things. It's not the smoothest implementation of driving, it's mainly\
      \ available for use in Matinee cutscenes or in other special situations (see\
      \ <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://unrealtournament2004.filefront.com/file/OSM_Guide;70724\"\
      >OSM-Guide's</a> final stages and the battle between Skaarj and Krall), but\
      \ it can be used in in-game situations if you're adept at ScriptedSequence AIScripting.\
      \ The reason this is a little more difficult is because the ScriptedMonsterController\
      \ expects to be controlling a Monster with a mesh able to Jump, Turn, etc. as\
      \ opposed to a Turret or Vehicle, which has no such movement animations.</p>\n\
      <p><b>How can I force the player to play a certain Character, have a specified\
      \ Name or carry particular default weapons at map start?</b></p>\n<p>The OSMObjectiveManager\
      \ has properties to define the default Character, Name and Equipment (weapons).\
      \ To define a custom Character, you must have a Character profile set up in\
      \ a .upl file in your ...UT2004/System/ directory. When defining equipment,\
      \ be aware that the property is a string variable type, expecting you to enter\
      \ items in the format, <tt>PackageName.ObjectName</tt>. For example, <tt>XWeapons.LinkGun</tt>.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Can I define extra weapons once the player has reached a certain Objective?</b></p>\n\
      <p>The OSMObjectiveManager can allow mappers to define AdditionalEquipment per\
      \ Objective so that if they die after reaching that Objective, they will respawn\
      \ with DefaultEquipment plus this AdditionalEquipment. AdditionalEquipment is\
      \ defined the same way DefaultEquipment is. (see the previous question) However,\
      \ if you want this addition to be used in all subsequent Objectives, you must\
      \ explicitly add them to each Objective.</p>\n<p><b>How can I set up a custom\
      \ loading screen for my OSM Adventure?</b></p>\n<p>To set up a custom loading\
      \ screen (aka, <a href=\"/Legacy:Vignette\" title=\"Legacy:Vignette\">Vignette</a>)\
      \ for your OSM Adventure map, you just need to have a texture embedded (<a href=\"\
      /Legacy:MyLevel\" title=\"Legacy:MyLevel\">myLevel</a>) in your map called \"\
      LoadingScreen\". To match other stock loading screens, a 4:3 ratio image (say,\
      \ 1024x768) is used to fill the top portion of a 1024x1024 texture. (So, the\
      \ bottom 256 pixels will be blank) This is imported to the myLevel package and\
      \ mipmaps are created on import. <b>Important:</b> This custom image must be\
      \ used somewhere in the map in order to be saved. It is suggested that it simply\
      \ be assigned as a Skins property on some hidden actor, like a NavigationPoint.</p>\n\
      <p><b>What should I do \"extra\" to make my map work as a CoOp OSM Adventure?</b></p>\n\
      <p>Cooperative play requires the mapper to take seriously the limitations of\
      \ online play. First and foremost, your map should be tested thoroughly for\
      \ proper online replication, so learn how to <a href=\"/Legacy:Launch_A_Local_Netgame\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Launch A Local Netgame\">Launch A Local Netgame</a> to test\
      \ as a DedicatedServer. Second, make sure that you have set up your level to\
      \ allow multiple Players, by setting MaxPlayers, placing enough TriggeredPlayerStarts,\
      \ providing extra Monsters, Weapons, Ammo, etc. Also, the progressive PlayerStart\
      \ setup will make the last Objective achieved the active respawning point. So\
      \ if Players are allowed to split up, when they die, they will respawn whereever\
      \ the last Objective achieved is. Finally, make sure your map won't frustrate\
      \ Players by limiting their tactics. If you have a gate slam down after the\
      \ first Player enters the room, the rest of the team could be stranded. Also,\
      \ cutscenes do not run online, so make sure the Players will know what to do\
      \ next even without them. <b>Important:</b> Do not set up critical Events to\
      \ be fired by a Matinee, because Matinee cutscenes will not run online. Instead,\
      \ have them triggered by a ScriptedTrigger or the like. CoOp OSM maps require\
      \ extra thought, more careful design and thorough testing than SinglePlayer\
      \ OSM Adventures will.</p>\n<p><b>How should I prepare my OSM map for release?</b></p>\n\
      <p>Be sure to include the OSMT files with your map zip file. It is small so\
      \ this shouldn't be a burden on the end user. You could include all the files\
      \ in their respective folders, including the OSMT.u, OSMT.ucl, OSMTex.utx and\
      \ the documation .txt files: OSMT_Dev, OSMT_Manual and OSMT_Readme. Or to make\
      \ this easier and to keep your map's custom content separate from the OSMT files,\
      \ you can simply add the entire OSMT .zip file to your map's .zip file. (an\
      \ embedded .zip) Without including these files, your map won't open for the\
      \ end user, so make sure to include simple installation instructions in your\
      \ map's readme.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tips\">Tips</span><span\

      Edit section: Tips\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <p>This is a list of useful suggestions for creating a successful singleplayer\
      \ or multiplayer OSM Adventure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure your adventure (story)\
      \ has a beginning, a middle and an end. Meaning, you have your players begin\
      \ the adventure with an introduction of some kind to establish the setting,\
      \ pose a main conflict, puzzle or question that players must solve, and then\
      \ have an initial \"push\" in the direction the adventure must go. Then, you\
      \ have the players run through a series of objectives that get progressively\
      \ harder, while showing more and more of the answers to the main conflict or\
      \ question, and giving them more items/friends/clues to help them with this\
      \ struggle as they go along. At the end, answer the biggest question and/or\
      \ bring the main conflict to a head (a big showdown), and then quickly wrap\
      \ it up with a satisfying resolution that tells the player they've set things\
      \ right again, put the world back in order in some way through this struggle.\
      \ This is story 101 and by figuring this out in detail ahead of time, the rest\
      \ of your design work will practically fall into place, believe me.</li>\n<li>Draft\
      \ a list of story points (objectives) according to your adventure idea. Refer\
      \ to this list as you sketch out a floorplan for your map. Think of the technical\
      \ things you'll need and if they seem to be more complex than you've done before,\
      \ or you're just not sure they're possible, <i>think of another way</i>. Don't\
      \ get caught in the trap of trying to construct the impossible because you said,\
      \ <i>\"Well, I'll figure that out when the time comes.\"</i> Do your research\
      \ and do some tests to ensure what you're thinking is at least possible.</li>\n\
      <li>Finish one area at a time. Begin at the beginning and move on from there.\
      \ Try not to jump ahead without at least thinking about how the areas you've\
      \ already worked on will be completed. That way, chances are better that you\
      \ will actually reach that completed state. Don't sell yourself short. Be picky\
      \ and tough on yourself before others do.</li>\n<li>Take a look at all the other\
      \ OSM Adventures available, just to see what's been done and take a look at\
      \ how they were done in the editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

    text: "'''OSM Adventure''' is a story-driven gametype that can create single player\
      \ or cooperative adventures in UT2004.  It is designed for players to \"run\
      \ the gauntlet\" among monsters, traps and puzzles to get to the end and win.\
      \ Players are given an optional limited number of lives, an optional timelimit,\
      \ but no goal (score) limit.\n\n'''''Note: Old Skool Monsta Toolz (OSMT) is\
      \ required to run OSM Adventure maps.  See [[Legacy:SuperApe/Old_Skool_Monsta_Toolz|Old\
      \ Skool Monsta Toolz]] for information and a download link.'''''\n\n==OSMGame\
      \ and Related Actors==\n\nThese actors available from Old Skool Monsta Toolz\
      \ help facilitate the OSM Adventure gametype.\n\n; OSMGame : This is the GameInfo\
      \ class for OSM.  In LevelProperties -> DefaultGametype, put <tt>OSMT.OSMGame</tt>.\n\
      ; OSMEndGameTrigger : This special Trigger tells the OSMGame to trigger an End\
      \ Game condition.  This trigger can be triggered or Touched by a player.  Note:\
      \ You can use more than one OSMEndGameTrigger and have different endings for\
      \ your map, if desired.\n; [[User:SuperApe/OSMObjectiveManager|OSMObjectiveManager]]\
      \ : This is a special Info actor that holds a database of information for the\
      \ Objectives in an OSM game.  It also handles Objective reaching, score and\
      \ Adrenaline awards per Objective and PlayerStart toggling, cutscene and DeathScene\
      \ handling, Objective timelimit management, among other major OSM Adventure\
      \ functions.\n\n==OSM Adventure Mapping Guide==\n\n===Overview===\n\nOSM Adventure\
      \ is a very versatile gametype that can be used to create adventures similar\
      \ to a wide variety of other popular video games genres; dungeon crawlers, platformers,\
      \ exploration games, etc.  Level designers can very easily create simple single\
      \ player or cooperative adventures with just a few added tools to a simple map.\
      \  But the scope of the kind of adventure you can make is limited only by your\
      \ imagination and your ability to implement custom content, such as custom player\
      \ models, creatures, etc.\n\n====\"The Story is the Thing\"====\n\nUnlike all\
      \ other UT2004 gametypes, OSM Adventure is meant to be driven by a story.  Players\
      \ will ''play'' the story as they progress through the map or series of maps.\
      \  As such, OSM Adventures should follow a storyline with a Beginning, Middle\
      \ and End.  To help tell the story and allow players to immerse themselves in\
      \ it, OSM Adventure takes advantage of Matinee cinematics, progressive Objectives\
      \ and other tools available from OSMT.  The very first thing an OSM Adventure\
      \ level designer should do is consider a storyline that would be fun to play\
      \ through.  You can find some inspiration and development tips for your story\
      \ at the External Links section at the bottom of this page.\n\n====Design Considerations====\n\
      \nPlayers should start out with a limited number of weapons and other powerup\
      \ items at their disposal. The advercity they face should be likewise limited.\
      \ As they progress, the monsters, traps and puzzles can get more difficult and\
      \ the powerups and items they find can get more powerful to help them. At various\
      \ stages within the map, after the player has achieved some goal, they should\
      \ be allowed to start from that point, as opposed to starting fromt the beginning\
      \ again. Monsters, traps and puzzles should be combined to offer more variety,\
      \ in other words, a simple trap often seems \"unfair\" to players, however a\
      \ trap that is combined with a puzzle or a monster can be more interesting.\
      \ At the end of an adventure, use an OSMEndGameTrigger to end the map, either\
      \ by leading the player to touch it or by using another trigger system (that\
      \ the player instigates) to trigger it.\n\nSee also the [http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/User:SuperApe/Mapping_For_OSM_Adventure#Tips\
      \ Tips] section below.\n\n===OSMObjectiveManager===\n\nThis actor is meant to\
      \ handle all aspects of the Objectives players can reach in an OSM Adventure\
      \ map.  It is also designed to start an intro matinee cutscene for the map as\
      \ well as intermediate cutscenes for each objective, if desired.  Set up Matinee\
      \ cutscenes as normal.  The OSMObjectiveManager holds a series of optional properties\
      \ for each Objective, including their ScoringValue, AdrenalineAward, PlayerStartTag\
      \ (see below), NextObjectiveTimelimit and CutSceneTag.  There is an additional\
      \ option to display the CutScene for that objective in \"Bullet Time\".  These\
      \ Objectives can only be triggered once and the trigger should be instigated\
      \ by the player, either directly or indirectly, to ensure adrenaline award,\
      \ etc.  The Objectives can be reached in any order.\n\nSee also [[User:SuperApe/OSMObjectiveManager|OSMObjectiveManager]].\n\
      \n===Progressive PlayerStart setup===\n\nAs the player achieves Objectives and\
      \ reaches a new area in the map, they will expect to be able to start from that\
      \ point in the level in case they die afterward.  Use [[Legacy:TriggeredPlayerStart|TriggeredPlayerStart]]s\
      \ that will be triggered on/off as the player progresses through the level.\
      \  An OSMObjectiveManager can handle the toggling of these playerstarts for\
      \ each Objective reached.  Make sure the only TriggeredPlayerStarts that are\
      \ bEnabled at match start are the first ones.  You should place multiple TriggeredPlayerStarts\
      \ in each Objective's start area, all set with matching Tags to be toggled by\
      \ the OSMObjectiveManager.\n\n===IntroCutScenes, Intermediate cutscenes and\
      \ DeathScenes===\n\nCutscenes are [[Legacy:Matinee|Matinee]]s used during OSM\
      \ play to give the Player important information about their place in the adventure.\
      \  It's good to keep Players informed as they begin their adventure, are challenged\
      \ by problems, achieve various goals and finish.  No cutscenes run during online\
      \ play, so Players should be given some clue as to their progress and their\
      \ next objective even without them.  Cutscene Matinees are set up as normal,\
      \ via the Matinee gui and using the [[Legacy:SceneManager|SceneManager]] actor.\
      \  Aside from the IntroCutScene, which has it's own IntroCutSceneTag and IntroCutSceneLength\
      \ properties in OSMObjectiveManager, all cutscenes are set to launch from the\
      \ OSMObjectiveManager through it's Objectives array.  All cutscenes must be\
      \ launched by the OSMObjectiveManager; do not launch them from another trigger\
      \ system.  The Player's Pawn can be controlled during a cutscene by simply setting\
      \ up a [[Legacy:ScriptedSequence|ScriptedSequence]] to control the pawn, and\
      \ matching the Tag of the script to the PlayerScriptTag property on the SceneManager.\
      \  As long as the cutscene is launched from the OSMObjectiveManager, it will\
      \ force the script to control the Player's Pawn during the scene.  Be careful\
      \ not to let the Pawn script last longer than the length of the cutscene.  The\
      \ Intro can also include the Player's Pawn (even though it is not in game yet)\
      \ by placing a ScriptedCharacter to control and giving it the Tag of \"IntroCutScenePawn\"\
      .  Most all ScriptedActions can be used to control the Player's pawn, such as\
      \ SetViewTarget, Run, Crouch, Walk, ShootTarget, etc.  For proper operation\
      \ online, remember never to trigger gameplay critical events from either the\
      \ SceneManager or the Pawn's script because Cutscenes do not run online.  Use\
      \ a ScriptedTrigger for those instead.  DeathScenes are just cutscenes that\
      \ the OSMObjectiveManager will automatically run at death.  Just create a simple,\
      \ short cutscene and match the Tag of to the OSMObjectiveManager's DeathSceneTag\
      \ property.  DeathScenes are automatically set to BulletTime and they will be\
      \ set to a fixed distance from the Player pawn, so your DeathScene movement\
      \ should only be controlling the angle of view.\n\n===Cheats===\n\nOSM Adventure\
      \ has an added cheat code (console command).\n; Comrade <CharacterName> [<bFavWeapon>]\
      \ [<bFullAmmo>] : This will spawn a ScriptedCharacter of any character profile\
      \ and optionally give them their favorite weapon or full ammo.  They will ally\
      \ themselves with the player and follow/fight alongside.  Since bots are not\
      \ enabled in OSM Adventure, this is a simplified substitute for offline Cooperative\
      \ play.  ''Example: \"comrade brock true true\", will spawn a Brock ScriptedCharacter\
      \ with his favorite weapon and given full ammo for that weapon.''\n\n==OSM Adventure\
      \ Mapping FAQ==\n\n'''What is OSM?'''\n\nOSM Adventure is a new gametype that\
      \ the OSMT toolset brings. It is designed to lead players to \"Run the gauntlet\
      \ of monsters, puzzles and traps.\" It is also a gametype that lends itself\
      \ to telling a story. Along with the use of cutscenes, special effects, and\
      \ the improved AI of the monsters, this gametype should set itself apart from\
      \ all others and offer players unique gameplay experiences.\n\n'''Is this a\
      \ SinglePlayer gametype or Cooperative?'''\n\nBoth. OSM Adventure was originally\
      \ designed to be a SinglePlayer, offline-only gametype, but has since evolved\
      \ to an online-capable gametype that allows more than one human player. The\
      \ mapper decides how many MaxPlayers their map will hold and designs the level\
      \ accordingly.\n\n'''How do I start mapping for OSM Adventure?'''\n\nRead the\
      \ section on [http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/User:SuperApe/Old_Skool_Monsta_Toolz#Mapping_with_OSMT\
      \ Old Skool Monsta Toolz] '''Mapping with OSMT : Quick Start''' to set up Ued\
      \ with OSMT and begin to use it in your custom map.  Map as normal, but use\
      \ LevelProperties -> DefaultGametype <tt>OSMT.OSMGame</tt>.\n\n'''What theme\
      \ should my OSM map be?'''\n\nLiterally any theme, any environment, any setting,\
      \ any time, any place. This gametype is the premiere storytelling gametype,\
      \ so imagination should reign supreme.\n\n'''How do I set up a story for my\
      \ OSM map?'''\n\nConcentrate on telling a good story, or rather, having the\
      \ player ''play'' a good story. Start them off in some minor conflict, give\
      \ them small Objectves to achieve. As they progress, ramp up the challenges,\
      \ make things harder. Likewise, as they achieve more, give them more pieces\
      \ to the puzzle of the story, give them more to work with to achieve the next\
      \ goals. In the end, tie all the questions and conflicts of your story together\
      \ into one final conflict or problem to solve. Make this final conflict the\
      \ biggest. Once that is achieved, give the player a quick but satisfying resolution\
      \ to the whole conflict or puzzle of the story and end it. For more on storytelling,\
      \ search the web, there's plenty.  Also check out the Story Structure links\
      \ at the bottom of this page.\n\n'''Do I need to have Monsters, Traps and Puzzles?'''\n\
      \nYou do not really need each of these, but this is what sets OSM apart from\
      \ other gametypes. It is highly recommended that you combine these elements,\
      \ so that a trap is combined with a puzzle, a puzzle with a monster, etc. This\
      \ makes their encounter more interesting and enjoyable for the player.\n\n'''How\
      \ do I set up complex Monster behavior?'''\n\nVery complex monster behavior\
      \ is possible with OSMT. This toolset is meant to mimic the old skool-style\
      \ monster support that UT and Unreal gave. That means old-timers will recognize\
      \ this stuff right away, but it also means there's plenty of info already on\
      \ the 'net to help. For a quick tutorial, see [[Legacy:Basic ScriptedPawn Tutorial|Basic\
      \ ScriptedPawn Tutorial]]. Steven Polge's [http://unreal.epicgames.com/AI.htm\
      \ Unreal Creature Care and Feeding Guide] is also a great resource. See also\
      \ the included Manual.\n\n'''What if I also want to have \"scripted\" behavior,\
      \ as in ScriptedSequences?'''\n\nOSMT includes two key ScriptedActions, <tt>ACTION_PossessPawn</tt>\
      \ and <tt>ACTION_Monsterize</tt>, that can \"catch and release\" NPC ScriptedMonsters.\
      \  Either in a cutscene or in mid-game, you can have a ScriptedSequence possess\
      \ a ScriptedMonster, control it and later monsterize it, to return control back\
      \ to a ScriptedMonsterController.  '''Important:''' If you go that route of\
      \ possessing the NPC mid-game, use the included Dummy Pawn as a placeholder\
      \ for that NPC, by setting its AI->AIScriptTag to the Tag of the ScriptedSequence.\
      \ Otherwise, the ScriptedSequence will be invalid and be removed at map start.\n\
      \n'''What are the available animations for these creatures?'''\n\nOSMT creatures\
      \ make use of the included UT2004 Invasion creature vertex mesh animations.\
      \  To view these, you can use the [[Legacy:Mesh Browser|Mesh Browser]]. ''(see\
      \ [[Legacy:Toolbar|Toolbar]] for a picture of the \"eye\" button)''  In UT2004,\
      \ this browser does seem to have a display bug, where if a Vertex Mesh actor\
      \ is in the map space already, none of the meshes display in the Mesh Browser.\
      \  So to view these animations, it's usually best to simply open a fresh UnrealEd\
      \ session and then open the Mesh Browser.\n\n'''Do I need Bot Support in an\
      \ OSM map?'''\n\nIt may sound strange to have [[Legacy:Bot Support|Bot Support]]\
      \ in a SinglePlayer map, but yes you need to have a botpath network in place\
      \ in order to allow proper Monster navigation. Monsters use the same navigation\
      \ actors as bots. The UnrealWiki is again a good place to get info, as is [http://blitz.unrealplayground.com/tutorials/bots.html\
      \ Blitz's Advanced Bot Pathing Tutorial].\n\n'''How do I set up Puzzles or Traps?'''\n\
      \nThere is no simple tutorial to make these things as they should be completely\
      \ unique to your map.  Liberal use of [[Legacy:Mover|Mover]]s and [[Legacy:Trigger\
      \ Systems|Trigger Systems]] is what makes these things work. The UnrealWiki\
      \ can help with a lot of the issues you may run into. By in large, Puzzles will\
      \ be far more complex, but IMO far more satisfying to players. Try to combine\
      \ these elements (monsters, puzzles and traps) together in different ways to\
      \ make things a bit more interesting.\n\n'''How can I detect when a group of\
      \ creatures are dead or when an area is cleared of monsters?'''\n\nA group of\
      \ creatures can be set with a common Event that will trigger a Counter.  When\
      \ the counter reaches the number of creatures in that group, the Counter will\
      \ fire.  If you don't know the number of monsters, but need to know if the player\
      \ is alone, use the included PlayerAloneTrigger, which will only fire if only\
      \ the player and friendly creatures are within its collision cylinder.\n\n'''How\
      \ does the player win?'''\n\nA player wins an OSM map when they've achieved\
      \ a final goal the mapper has set. In technical terms, an OSMEndGameTrigger\
      \ is used to signal to the OSMGame that the player has won. This trigger can\
      \ be Touched by the player Pawn or Triggered.\n\n'''How do I set up Objectives?'''\n\
      \nUsing an [[User:SuperApe/OSMObjectiveManager|OSMObjectveManager]] simplifies\
      \ most of it. You can concentrate on the points of your story, the level, the\
      \ things the player needs to achieve. Then, set a Trigger for each of those\
      \ Objectives to go off when the player achieves them. That trigger is used to\
      \ signal to the OSMObjectiveManager that they've done it, to signal a cutscene\
      \ (to tell the player they've done it), toggle new PlayerStarts, give a Score\
      \ or Adrenaline award, start a timelimit to reach the next Objective, etc. Just\
      \ make sure the trigger is somehow Instigated by the player so they are properly\
      \ awarded points, etc. That's pretty much it.\n\n'''How do I set up a player\
      \ script to run during a cutscene?'''\n\nYou can easily control the player's\
      \ pawn during your Objective cutscenes. The SceneManager already has a PlayerScriptTag\
      \ property to match to your AIScript's Tag. Unfortunately, the stock code for\
      \ this doesn't work. But as long as you have an OSMObjectiveManager starting\
      \ the scene, it will force it to work for you. You need to use a ScriptedSequence\
      \ and match the Tag to the PlayerScriptTag property for your cutscene, do not\
      \ use an UnrealScriptedSequence for this purpose. You can set the ControllerClass\
      \ to either None or ScriptedController, do not use an AIController for this\
      \ purpose. You can do many of the [[Legacy:ScriptedAction|ScriptedAction]]s\
      \ in your script, including SetViewActor, MoveToPoint, Crouch, Walk, PlaySound,\
      \ PlayAnimation, etc. You can use the ScriptedSequence itself as the target\
      \ for a MoveToPoint or SetViewTarget action. ''Be very careful not to let the\
      \ script run longer than the cutscene.'' Test your cutscene with many variations\
      \ on player position and status to make sure everything works.  Note: Online\
      \ games omit all cutscenes.\n\n'''How do I set up a custom DeathScene?'''\n\n\
      A DeathScene is just another matinee cutscene. It will be played upon player\
      \ death as long as you match the DeathSceneTag property on the OSMObjectiveManager\
      \ to the Tag of the DeathScene matinee. DeathScenes are always played in BulletTime.\
      \ It's a good idea to signal to the player they have died. For that purpose,\
      \ a \"YouDied\" texture is included in the OSMTex texture package for the purposes\
      \ of a CameraOverlay. Note that the distance from camera to carcass is locked\
      \ and doesn't change, although the camera angle will according to your custom\
      \ DeathScene matinee.  Note: Online games omit DeathScenes.\n\n'''Are vehicles\
      \ allowed? Translocators?'''\n\nYes, vehicles are allowed by default. Included\
      \ in the toolset is the [[Open_Source/TeamVehicleFactory|TeamVehicleFactory]],\
      \ but you can also use an ONS factory or those made for VCTF. By default, no\
      \ translocators are available in OSM, however if you want them in your map,\
      \ just add a NewWeaponPickup and set Pickup -> PowerUp to \"Transpickup\".\n\
      \n'''Can I get ScriptedCharacters to drive/ride in vehicles or use a turret?'''\n\
      \nScriptedCharacter subclasses can use vehicles or turrets via ScriptedSequences\
      \ and included ScriptedActions such as <tt>ACTION_TryToDrive</tt>, <tt>ACTION_ExitVehicle</tt>,\
      \ <tt>ACTION_VehicleFire</tt>, etc.  Once driving, they can be directed to <tt>ACTION_MoveToPoint</tt>\
      \ to go places or <tt>ACTION_SetViewTarget</tt> to aim at things.  It's not\
      \ the smoothest implementation of driving, it's mainly available for use in\
      \ Matinee cutscenes or in other special situations (see [http://unrealtournament2004.filefront.com/file/OSM_Guide;70724\
      \ OSM-Guide's] final stages and the battle between Skaarj and Krall), but it\
      \ can be used in in-game situations if you're adept at ScriptedSequence AIScripting.\
      \ The reason this is a little more difficult is because the ScriptedMonsterController\
      \ expects to be controlling a Monster with a mesh able to Jump, Turn, etc. as\
      \ opposed to a Turret or Vehicle, which has no such movement animations.\n\n\
      '''How can I force the player to play a certain Character, have a specified\
      \ Name or carry particular default weapons at map start?'''\n\nThe OSMObjectiveManager\
      \ has properties to define the default Character, Name and Equipment (weapons).\
      \ To define a custom Character, you must have a Character profile set up in\
      \ a .upl file in your ...UT2004/System/ directory. When defining equipment,\
      \ be aware that the property is a string variable type, expecting you to enter\
      \ items in the format, <tt>PackageName.ObjectName</tt>. For example, <tt>XWeapons.LinkGun</tt>.\n\
      \n'''Can I define extra weapons once the player has reached a certain Objective?'''\n\
      \nThe OSMObjectiveManager can allow mappers to define AdditionalEquipment per\
      \ Objective so that if they die after reaching that Objective, they will respawn\
      \ with DefaultEquipment plus this AdditionalEquipment.  AdditionalEquipment\
      \ is defined the same way DefaultEquipment is. (see the previous question) \
      \ However, if you want this addition to be used in all subsequent Objectives,\
      \ you must explicitly add them to each Objective.\n\n'''How can I set up a custom\
      \ loading screen for my OSM Adventure?'''\n\nTo set up a custom loading screen\
      \ (aka, [[Legacy:Vignette|Vignette]]) for your OSM Adventure map, you just need\
      \ to have a texture embedded ([[Legacy:MyLevel|myLevel]]) in your map called\
      \ \"LoadingScreen\".  To match other stock loading screens, a 4:3 ratio image\
      \ (say, 1024x768) is used to fill the top portion of a 1024x1024 texture. (So,\
      \ the bottom 256 pixels will be blank)  This is imported to the myLevel package\
      \ and mipmaps are created on import.  '''Important:''' This custom image must\
      \ be used somewhere in the map in order to be saved.  It is suggested that it\
      \ simply be assigned as a Skins property on some hidden actor, like a NavigationPoint.\n\
      \n'''What should I do \"extra\" to make my map work as a CoOp OSM Adventure?'''\n\
      \nCooperative play requires the mapper to take seriously the limitations of\
      \ online play. First and foremost, your map should be tested thoroughly for\
      \ proper online replication, so learn how to [[Legacy:Launch A Local Netgame|Launch\
      \ A Local Netgame]] to test as a DedicatedServer. Second, make sure that you\
      \ have set up your level to allow multiple Players, by setting MaxPlayers, placing\
      \ enough TriggeredPlayerStarts, providing extra Monsters, Weapons, Ammo, etc.\
      \ Also, the progressive PlayerStart setup will make the last Objective achieved\
      \ the active respawning point. So if Players are allowed to split up, when they\
      \ die, they will respawn whereever the last Objective achieved is. Finally,\
      \ make sure your map won't frustrate Players by limiting their tactics. If you\
      \ have a gate slam down after the first Player enters the room, the rest of\
      \ the team could be stranded. Also, cutscenes do not run online, so make sure\
      \ the Players will know what to do next even without them. '''Important:'''\
      \ Do not set up critical Events to be fired by a Matinee, because Matinee cutscenes\
      \ will not run online.  Instead, have them triggered by a ScriptedTrigger or\
      \ the like.  CoOp OSM maps require extra thought, more careful design and thorough\
      \ testing than SinglePlayer OSM Adventures will.\n\n'''How should I prepare\
      \ my OSM map for release?'''\n\nBe sure to include the OSMT files with your\
      \ map zip file. It is small so this shouldn't be a burden on the end user. You\
      \ could include all the files in their respective folders, including the OSMT.u,\
      \ OSMT.ucl, OSMTex.utx and the documation .txt files: OSMT_Dev, OSMT_Manual\
      \ and OSMT_Readme. Or to make this easier and to keep your map's custom content\
      \ separate from the OSMT files, you can simply add the entire OSMT .zip file\
      \ to your map's .zip file. (an embedded .zip)  Without including these files,\
      \ your map won't open for the end user, so make sure to include simple installation\
      \ instructions in your map's readme.\n\n==Tips==\n\nThis is a list of useful\
      \ suggestions for creating a successful singleplayer or multiplayer OSM Adventure.\n\
      \n* Make sure your adventure (story) has a beginning, a middle and an end. Meaning,\
      \ you have your players begin the adventure with an introduction of some kind\
      \ to establish the setting, pose a main conflict, puzzle or question that players\
      \ must solve, and then have an initial \"push\" in the direction the adventure\
      \ must go. Then, you have the players run through a series of objectives that\
      \ get progressively harder, while showing more and more of the answers to the\
      \ main conflict or question, and giving them more items/friends/clues to help\
      \ them with this struggle as they go along. At the end, answer the biggest question\
      \ and/or bring the main conflict to a head (a big showdown), and then quickly\
      \ wrap it up with a satisfying resolution that tells the player they've set\
      \ things right again, put the world back in order in some way through this struggle.\
      \ This is story 101 and by figuring this out in detail ahead of time, the rest\
      \ of your design work will practically fall into place, believe me.\n* Draft\
      \ a list of story points (objectives) according to your adventure idea. Refer\
      \ to this list as you sketch out a floorplan for your map. Think of the technical\
      \ things you'll need and if they seem to be more complex than you've done before,\
      \ or you're just not sure they're possible, ''think of another way''. Don't\
      \ get caught in the trap of trying to construct the impossible because you said,\
      \ ''\"Well, I'll figure that out when the time comes.\"'' Do your research and\
      \ do some tests to ensure what you're thinking is at least possible.\n* Finish\
      \ one area at a time. Begin at the beginning and move on from there. Try not\
      \ to jump ahead without at least thinking about how the areas you've already\
      \ worked on will be completed. That way, chances are better that you will actually\
      \ reach that completed state. Don't sell yourself short. Be picky and tough\
      \ on yourself before others do.\n* Take a look at all the other OSM Adventures\
      \ available, just to see what's been done and take a look at how they were done\
      \ in the editor.\n\n==Resources==\n\n===External Links===\n\n====OSM Adventure\
