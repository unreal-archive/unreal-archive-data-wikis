      \ is best for this situation. Perhaps you just want to know what's possible\
      \ with these monsters. This reference is here to help guide your design decisions.</p>\n\
      <p>First listed is the ScriptedMonster Basics, the properties and orders available\
      \ to all OSMT creatures, the ScriptedMonster classes. After that, individual\
      \ creatures and their properties, behaviors and orders are listed.</p>\n<p>While\
      \ many of these creature classes mimic old UT monster classes, they are not\
      \ meant to duplicate them. There are significant differences between classic\
      \ UT creatures and OSMT creatures, despite the many similarities. Several new\
      \ behaviors, properties and orders have been added to these creatures. The wiki\
      \ page links are provided purely for reference.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ it handles all the advanced AI features that were handled by the ScriptedPawn\
      \ class from UT. ScriptedMonster is meant to be the accessible class the mapper\
      \ modifies to tweak the individual creature properties to suit the needs of\
      \ their map.</p>\n<p>Additionally, note that if you would like to add your own\
      \ custom monster at some point, subclass ScriptedMonster and make use of the\
      \ functions available in this class and the functions used in other ScriptedMonster\

      \ given more important duties than Brutes, like Patroling and Guarding. Krall\
      \ are very agile; able to run quickly and jump very far. Krall carry a bladed\
      \ staff which fires a yellow enegy bolt, so it can be used in close range as\
      \ well as long. They have various striking melee attacks, both one handed and\
      \ two handed. One two-handed attack is called a Pound, as the staff is brought\
      \ down from over the Krall's head. Another two-handed attack is called a Throw,\
      \ as the target is stabbed with the staff and then lifted and tossed backwards\
      \ at the same time. Krall can also fire their projectile rapidly while standing\
      \ in place, or at a slower rate as they walk towards their Enemy. Krall have\
      \ nimble legs, but those legs are vulnerable to damage. Krall are able to loose\
      \ their legs completely during combat and still put up a good fight by crawling\
      \ and firing with their staff weapon. Krall are sometimes found sleeping (sometimes\
      \ even while standing against a wall), but they are still fairly aware while\
      \ asleep. Krall can be mischievious at times as well. They like to play dice\
      \ games while on duty and are often found in groups of 2 to 8 sitting in a circle\
      \ playing. They are slightly less aware than normal while they concentrate on\

      \ has evolved through metamorphosis to the smartest, toughest and most dangerous\
      \ creature. Warlords appear as giant Skaarj (like SkaarjBerserkers) with bat-like\
      \ wings, very heavy armor and horns. Instead of using its blades or bio-electrical\
      \ projectiles, the Walord has a special device fitted on its arm. It is a combonation\
      \ rocket launcher and teleportation device. The rocket launcher fires homing\
      \ rockets, able to lock onto the target and home in with moderate agility. The\
      \ Warlord is able to use its rocket launcher as a club in close combat, but\
      \ at distances, will fire two shots in quick succession. The Warlord can fire\
      \ while walking toward its target or while flying. Warlords are moderately agile\
      \ for their size, able to dodge projectile fire while walking or running. In\
      \ the air, Warlords are extreamely agile, so they often prefer to be air born.\
      \ For this reason, Warlords are typically found in more open spaces. If injured\
      \ during combat, Warlords may use their teleportation device to retreat or to\
      \ suprise their Enemy by appearing behind them. If hunting their Enemy, Warlords\
      \ may use their teleportation device to \"jump ahead\", to close the gap on\
      \ their Enemy, or to search around the area quickly. If seriously injured Warlords\
      \ have been known to use the teleportation device to retreat from the battle\
      \ altogether, laughing as they do so, to live and fight another day. If killed\
      \ while flying, the Warlord will likely fall upside down to the ground and if\
      \ the Enemy is still in sight, it will raise its rocket launcher to fire off\
      \ one last \"death shot\" at them before dying. The Warlord is considered a\
      \ Boss, so other creatures will avoid getting into combat with it.</p>\n<h3><span\

  wikitext:
    text: "==Overview==\n\n'''''Note: This is a reference for creatures found in [[User:SuperApe/Old_Skool_Monsta_Toolz|Old\
      \ Skool Monsta Toolz]].  This is '''not''' meant to be a redefinition of the\
      \ old Unreal or UT creatures.  Do not edit this page to make the information\
      \ fit old Unreal.'''''\n\nAs a Level Designer, you need to know as much as possible\
      \ about the monster you're placing in your map. Maybe you're devising the monster\
      \ placement and want to know what monster is best for this situation. Perhaps\
      \ you just want to know what's possible with these monsters.  This reference\
      \ is here to help guide your design decisions.\n\nFirst listed is the ScriptedMonster\
      \ Basics, the properties and orders available to all OSMT creatures, the ScriptedMonster\
      \ classes.  After that, individual creatures and their properties, behaviors\
      \ and orders are listed.\n\nWhile many of these creature classes mimic old UT\
      \ monster classes, they are not meant to duplicate them.  There are significant\
      \ differences between classic UT creatures and OSMT creatures, despite the many\
      \ similarities.  Several new behaviors, properties and orders have been added\
      \ to these creatures.  The wiki page links are provided purely for reference.\n\
      \n==ScriptedMonster Basics==\n\nScriptedMonster is the base class for all the\
      \ creatures in the OSMT toolset. Along with a custom Controller class, ScriptedMonsterController,\
      \ it handles all the advanced AI features that were handled by the ScriptedPawn\
      \ class from UT. ScriptedMonster is meant to be the accessible class the mapper\
      \ modifies to tweak the individual creature properties to suit the needs of\
      \ their map.\n\nAdditionally, note that if you would like to add your own custom\
      \ monster at some point, subclass ScriptedMonster and make use of the functions\
      \ available in this class and the functions used in other ScriptedMonster subclasses\
      \ for easy development and integration to this toolset.\n\n===Properties===\n\
      \nAlong with the normal Pawn and xPawn attributes, ScriptedMonsters have several\
      \ new properties to help configure the creature's behavior. Most of these properties\
      \ are used the same way as they were in UT.\n\n====AI====\n; Aggressiveness\
      \ : A ranking of how aggressive this creature is, generally between -1.0 and\
      \ 1.0.\n; AttitudeToPlayer : A setting that defines the creature's behavior\
      \ toward human players at map start. Creatures react to each other as defined\
      \ by their species.\n* ATTITUDE_Fear : This creature will try to flee from players.\n\
      * ATTITUDE_Hate : This creature will attack players.\n* ATTITUDE_Frenzy : This\
      \ creature will fight players to the end and never flee. It is a little less\
      \ accurate and tends not to change Enemies.\n* ATTITUDE_Threaten : This creature\
      \ will make hostile motions but will wait for the player to initiate combat.\n\
      * ATTITUDE_Ignore : This creature will ignore players.\n* ATTITUDE_Friendly\
      \ : This creature will not attack players. If possible, this creature may greet\
      \ the player.\n* ATTITUDE_Follow : If more intelligent (Mammal and up), this\
      \ creature will follow the player. If possible, this creature will fight the\
      \ player's Enemies.\n* ATTITUDE_MAX : (not yet implemented)\n; bDelayedPatrol\
      \ : If True, this creature will wait until triggered before it starts its patrol.\
      \ (Must have \"Patroling\" Orders and patrol route set up)\n; bDropOnlyOne :\
      \ If True, the creature can only drop one of the items listed in the GoodieDrop\
      \ property array when it dies. The item is picked randomly.\n; bFixedStart :\
      \ If True, this creature will not be moved from its placed location. Some Orders\
      \ (like Patroling and Ambushing) use this property to determine if the creature\
      \ should be moved directly to a related AI actor location at map start.\n; bHateWhenTriggered\
      \ : If True, this creature will Hate (ATTITUDE_Hate) the player when triggered.\n\
      ; bIgnoreFriends : If True, this creature will deregard rank and hunt players\
      \ on their own.\n; bIsBoss : If True, this creature will be given extra health\
      \ (up to +15% multiplied by Skill) and other creatures will avoid combat with\
      \ it.\n; bIsWuss : If True, this creature is inclined to take damage without\
      \ fighting back.\n; bQuiet : If True, this creature will play no sounds.\n;\
      \ bTeamLeader : If True and if part of a team, this creature will command others\
      \ with a matching TeamTag.\n; FirstHatePlayerEvent : This Event is fired when\
      \ this creature first encounters a player it Hates.\n; GoodieDrop : A dynamic\
      \ list of Pickups this creature will drop when it dies.\n; HearingThreshold\
      \ : This is actually a standard Pawn property. It determines the relative threshold\
      \ the creature will hear Enemies. It translates to a distance the creature can\
      \ react to sounds, lower threshold being longer distance.\n; Intelligence :\
      \ A setting that defines the relative intelligence (memory, tactics, etc.) of\
      \ this creature.\n* BRAINS_None : Amoeba-like. Only reacts to immediate stimulus.\n\
      * BRAINS_Reptile :\n* BRAINS_Mammal :\n* BRAINS_Human : Player-like. Advanced\
      \ tactics.\n; SightRadius : This is actually a standard Pawn property. It determines\
      \ the distance in UU that the creature will be able to see Enemies.\n; Skill\
      \ : A ranking of how well this creature performs in combat. This property affects\
      \ aim, movement speed, dodging ability, etc. If zero, the creature will be given\
      \ the configured game Skill level. If more than zero, this value is added to\
      \ the configured game Skill level, up to a maximum of 7 (equalling \"Godlike\"\
      ).\n; TeamTag : A name given to the team which this creature belongs.\n\n====Gib====\n\
      ; GibScale : A DrawScale multiplier given to gibs spawned from this creature.\n\
      \n====Orders====\n; AlarmTag : This creature is associated with AlarmPoints\
      \ with this Tag. It will begin to perform their Alarm procedures when it first\
      \ sees a player.\n; Orders : Determines this creature's initial state and commanded\
      \ tasks. Typical Orders available to all creatures are: Ambushing, Guarding,\
      \ Patroling, and Waiting. Some creatures have unique Orders available as well.\n\
      ; OrderTag : This Tag further identifies an actor for the creature to act its\
      \ Orders upon. An Ambushing creature will ambush from an AmbushPoint with a\
      \ matching Tag, a Guarding creature will guard the actor with a matching Tag,\
      \ a Patroling creature will begin its patrol route at the PatrolPoint with a\
      \ matching Tag.\n; SharedAlarmTag : If multiple creatures are to use the same\
      \ AlarmTag, set that Tag here so that only one of the creatures perform the\
      \ Alarm behaviors.\n\n====Main (ScriptedMonster)====\n; OddsOfAppearing : The\
      \ chance this creature will show up at map start. Default = 1.0 (or 100%) This\
      \ chance is adjusted by game Skill level.\n; StartingAnim : The name of the\
      \ animation sequence to loop at map start.\n\n====Sound====\n; Acquire : The\
      \ sound made when this creature acquires an Enemy.\n; Fear : The sound made\
      \ when this creature is frightened.\n; Roam : The sound made when this creature\
      \ is roaming or wandering.\n; Threaten : The sound made when this creature is\
      \ threatening an Enemy.\n\n===Orders===\n\nThese Orders are behavior states\
      \ available to all ScriptedMonster classes.  By setting the Orders string property\
      \ to these keywords, the creature will follow a set of rules governing their\
      \ behavior.  In addition to these standard available Orders, many creatures\
      \ have individual Orders unique to their class.  Check the creature class definitions\
      \ below for available Orders unique to that class.\n; Waiting : (default) Wander\
      \ or Camp nearby the placed spot until an Enemy is detected. Attack and freely\
      \ roam afterwards.\n; Ambushing : Travel to an AmbushPoint (or spawn at one\
      \ at map start) whose Tag matches OrderTag, wait for an Enemy, then Attack.\
      \ Find an AmbushPoint again after combat and wait for another player.\n; Guarding\
      \ : Guard an actor whose Tag matches OrderTag. Remain near and return to the\
      \ placed spot after combat.\n; Patroling : Travel from one PatrolPoint (or spawn\
      \ at one at map start), whose Tag matches OrderTag, to the NextPatrol in a series,\
      \ leave for combat and return to patrol afterward.\n; Pose : This auxilliary\
      \ Order is available to all ScriptedMonsters. It will force the creature to\
      \ remain in place and loop it's StartingAnim sequence. The creature will not\
      \ react to players or game events, so it is mostly used for non-game releated\
      \ purposes, like taking screenshots, matinee cutscenes or decoration.\n\n===Useful\
      \ Functions===\n* A monster who dies will automatically trigger its Event. This\
      \ can be used in a variety of situations where the mapper will require things\
      \ to happen once the monster is dead, or to wait for things to happen until\
      \ the monster had died. To set this up, the mapper will match the monster's\
      \ Event to the Tag of some other triggerable actor. The player who kills the\
      \ monster is considered the Instigator of the Event.\n* A monster who is triggered\
      \ in some way where the Instigator of the trigger Event is a Pawn (Player or\
      \ otherwise), will immediately become aware of the Pawn and consider the Pawn\
      \ their Enemy. To set this up, the mapper will match the monster's Tag to the\
      \ Event of some trigger system (trigger, Mover, another monster, etc.) where\
      \ the player will cause (or Instigate) the Event.\n\n===Notes===\n\nFor a step-by-step\

      \nThe Nalicow is a herd animal that was raised by the Nali, the oppressed race\
      \ that players saved in the original Unreal game. Nalicows are harmless. They\
      \ walk around, moo, shake, and sometimes poop a green blob that eventually \"\
      pops\" in green smoke. Sometimes Nalicows are accompanied by BabyCows, which\
      \ will usually stay close. If hurt, the Nalicow tends to turn away from the\
      \ attacker and run.\n\n===Properties===\n; bHasBaby : If True, a baby cow will\
      \ be spawned near this cow. It will stay close to this cow.\n; bStayClose :\
      \ If True, this cow will not wander beyond the WanderRadius.\n; WanderRadius\

      \nThe Fly is a large flying insect with little (no) intelligence. It will buzz\
      \ as it flies. It crawls and flies until an Enemy is found. It will generally\
      \ home in on the Enemy by flying because it flies much faster than it crawls,\
      \ but when close it will usually land and attack from the ground, as it's ground\
      \ attack can be made more frequently. If hit, the Fly will usually try to dodge\
      \ by flying. Although a single Fly can be easy to defeat, swarms of Flies can\
      \ be very challenging. When found in a swarm, Flies are sometimes known to alert\
      \ the rest of the hive, if angered, causing the entire hive to attack at once.\n\
      \n===Properties===\n; bAngryHive : If True, other Flies with the same Tag are\
      \ considered of the same hive and if this Fly is damaged by an Enemy, it will\
      \ immediately break off and attempt to alert all other Flies in it's hive. It\
      \ will make all efforts to reach any \"hivemate\" Fly without an Enemy and tell\
      \ them about their Enemy. Those hivemates will immediately attack the Enemy.\
      \ The result can be like a swarming effect.\n\n===Orders===\n; Prone : This\
      \ special Order simply allows mappers to place a Fly and not worry that it will\
      \ wander around or fly. Instead the placed fly will remain \"grounded\" until\

      \ intelligent and far from harmless. They \"skitter\" around on four spider-like\
      \ legs and can lunge about as far as a player can dodge or double-jump. They\
      \ are sometimes found feeding on the carcasses they've killed.\n\n===Orders===\n\
      ; Feeding : This special Order will cause the Pupae to remain in their placed\
      \ location and feed on a carcass. It will play a series of biting and tearing\
      \ animations as it munches down on the carcass directly in front of it. The\
      \ mapper should supply a carcass or gib decoration for this purpose and place\
      \ it directly in front of the placed Pupae.\n; Pouncing : This special Order\
      \ will allow mappers to place Pupae on walls, ceilings, etc. and they will \"\

      \nMantas are simple flying reptilian creatures. They mostly glide and fly, but\
      \ are known to land and rest, while flipping their tails. When an Enemy is detected\
      \ they are known to dive and attack with agility. Mantas are better in open\

      \nThis subclass is a \"mother\" of other Gasbags. It is three times the size\
      \ and very powerful. On top of that, this creature can spit out either fireball\
      \ projectiles or normal-sized Gasbags from it's mouth. These \"child\" Gasbags\
      \ will attack the mother's Enemy as well. If there is no Enemy around, the mother\
      \ may decide to retrieve child Gasbags by tracking them down and swallowing\
      \ them whole. Child Gasbags resist this a little and back away from the mother.\

      \ jump very far. Krall carry a bladed staff which fires a yellow enegy bolt,\
      \ so it can be used in close range as well as long. They have various striking\
      \ melee attacks, both one handed and two handed. One two-handed attack is called\
      \ a Pound, as the staff is brought down from over the Krall's head. Another\
      \ two-handed attack is called a Throw, as the target is stabbed with the staff\
      \ and then lifted and tossed backwards at the same time. Krall can also fire\
      \ their projectile rapidly while standing in place, or at a slower rate as they\
      \ walk towards their Enemy. Krall have nimble legs, but those legs are vulnerable\

      \ still put up a good fight by crawling and firing with their staff weapon.\
      \ Krall are sometimes found sleeping (sometimes even while standing against\
      \ a wall), but they are still fairly aware while asleep. Krall can be mischievious\
      \ at times as well. They like to play dice games while on duty and are often\

      \ through metamorphosis to the smartest, toughest and most dangerous creature.\
      \ Warlords appear as giant Skaarj (like SkaarjBerserkers) with bat-like wings,\
      \ very heavy armor and horns. Instead of using its blades or bio-electrical\
      \ projectiles, the Walord has a special device fitted on its arm. It is a combonation\
      \ rocket launcher and teleportation device. The rocket launcher fires homing\
      \ rockets, able to lock onto the target and home in with moderate agility. The\
      \ Warlord is able to use its rocket launcher as a club in close combat, but\
      \ at distances, will fire two shots in quick succession. The Warlord can fire\
      \ while walking toward its target or while flying. Warlords are moderately agile\
      \ for their size, able to dodge projectile fire while walking or running. In\
      \ the air, Warlords are extreamely agile, so they often prefer to be air born.\
      \ For this reason, Warlords are typically found in more open spaces. If injured\
      \ during combat, Warlords may use their teleportation device to retreat or to\
      \ suprise their Enemy by appearing behind them. If hunting their Enemy, Warlords\
      \ may use their teleportation device to \"jump ahead\", to close the gap on\
      \ their Enemy, or to search around the area quickly. If seriously injured Warlords\
      \ have been known to use the teleportation device to retreat from the battle\
      \ altogether, laughing as they do so, to live and fight another day. If killed\
      \ while flying, the Warlord will likely fall upside down to the ground and if\
      \ the Enemy is still in sight, it will raise its rocket launcher to fire off\
      \ one last \"death shot\" at them before dying. The Warlord is considered a\

      \ is slightly distracted and less aware while mutilating. When an Enemy is detected,\
      \ the Warlord will laugh at them and then attack. A large gib is automatically\
      \ spawned in front of the Warlord, so there is no need for the mapper to supply\
      \ this gib. The gib will automatically disappear a short time after the Warlord\
      \ has left to attack an Enemy.\n\n==ScriptedCharacter==\n\n'''Name:''' (Character\

      \ are player character Monsters. They look, sound and fight similar to normal\
      \ Players. They may appear as any Player character. Most of the time, they will\
      \ be friendly to Players and fight by their side, but these characters sometimes\
      \ are held hostage, ignore Players or turn against Players and command legions\
      \ of Monsters. Although they cannot pickup items, ScriptedCharacters attack\
      \ by using up the weapon pickups they have in their inventory, so their attacks\
      \ and damage vary depending on the weapon used. Once a weapon is depleated of\
      \ ammo, they will switch to another weapon until their inventory is empty. ScriptedCharacters\
      \ are very talkative. They will Taunt, Challenge and Cheer.\n\n===Properties===\n\
      \n====Main====\n\nIf set, these properties will override the default settings\
      \ on ScriptedCharacters.\n; FighterAnim : The anim sequence used when this ScriptedCharacter\
      \ challenges another Pawn.\n; GreetingAnim : The anim sequence used when this\
      \ ScriptedCharacter greets a friendly Pawn.\n; OverrideHealth : If more than\
      \ 0, will explicitly set this creature's Health.\n; OverrideShield : Explicitly\
      \ sets this creature's ShieldStrength.\n; ThreatenAnim : The anim sequence used\
      \ when this ScriptedCharacter is warning another Pawn.\n; VictoryAnim : The\
      \ anim sequence used when this ScriptedCharacter is feeling victorious.\n\n\
      ====AI====\n; (bQuiet): Use this normal ScriptedMonster property to make sure\
      \ this ScriptedCharacter doesn't talk, taunt or cheer. It will still cry in\
      \ pain and death.\n; (GoodieDrop): Use this normal ScriptedMonster array to\
      \ give this creature WeaponPickups to use. This creature will use the last WeaponPickup\
      \ on the list first, the next to last second, etc.  AmmoPickups are also used.\
      \  List ammo ''after'' the weapon to make sure they use it.\n; (PlacedCharacterName):\
      \ Use this normal xPawn property to define the Character. By using a standard\
      \ Character name (or a custom Character Name defined in a .upl file), the proper\
      \ Character mesh, skins and sounds will be set automatically at map start.\n\
      \n====Sounds====\n; bAllowCharacterOverride : If True, this creature will retain\
      \ the default phrases for Greeting, Threaten, Fear, etc., based on the default\
      \ Character sounds.\n; Greeting : The sound made by this Character when it greets\
      \ a friend.\n; TalkativePct : The chance percentage this Character Taunts, Challenges,\
      \ Cheers, etc. when it wants to.\n; Victory : The sound made by this Character\
      \ when it defeats an Enemy.\n\n===Notes===\n\nA ScriptedCharacter can be placed\
      \ in an OSM Adventure map with the Tag \"IntroCutScenePawn\" and it will be\
      \ reset to appear as the Player's selected Character during the IntroCutScene.\
      \ It will be removed from the level at the end of the IntroCutScene.\n\n==Related\
