      \ by default.\n; \"Navigation point embedded in world geometry\" : You've placed\
      \ a pathnode ouside of subtracted space.  Simply delete the node or move it\
      \ back inside.\n; \"Navigation point is not on valid base\" : You've placed\
      \ a navigation point on either a mover or a nonsolid actor.  Move it to an appropriate\
      \ spot on flat, solid space.\n; \"No forced destination for this jumppad!\"\
      \ : You've added a [[Legacy:UTJumpPad|UTJumpPad]], but have not forced a path\
      \ from it to a [[Legacy:JumpSpot|JumpSpot]].  To get a UTJumpPad to work correctly,\
      \ this must be done.  Remember that the UTJumpPad's Properties>>Navigation Point>>ForcedPath\
      \ array must contain the actual '''name''' of the actor, '''not''' the [[Legacy:Tag|Tag]].\
      \  The name of an object is found under its Properties>>Object>>Name, and will\
      \ be something like JumpSpot0.\n; \"No navigation point associated with this\
      \ mover!\" : If the specified mover is a lift, you have not placed a [[Legacy:LiftCenter|LiftCenter]]\
      \ and/or [[Legacy:LiftExit|LiftExit]] and associated them with the mover.  If\
      \ the specified mover is a door, set its Properties>>AI to bAutoDoor=True or\
      \ bNoAIRelevance=True.  If the mover is neither, then set its Properties>>AI\
      \ to bNoAIRelevance=True.\n; \"Pathnode X should be JumpDest for Pathnode Y\"\
      \ : Pathnode X is at a hard-to-reach location from Pathnode Y's position, and\
      \ so a jumpspot should be placed there to make bot navigation easier.\n\n====Rebuild\
      \ Errors====\n; \"Navigation point is too close or on too steep a slope\" :\
      \ You've placed a navigation point too close to a steep slope or too high above\
      \ the ground.  Move it to a flat, solid area, move it closer to the ground,\
      \ or delete it.  Often occurs when pathing is done before terrain is finished,\
      \ and the terrain is raised above the existing navigation point.\n; \"No paths\
      \ from Pathnode X\" : Just what it says: there are no paths to the pathnode\
      \ specified.  To solve this issue, add pathnodes to connect the node in question\
      \ to the rest of the network.  Occurs when paths are forced to a pathnode, or\
      \ when a pathnode is at the bottom of a steep drop.  Often occurs in conjunction\
      \ with the next error.\n; \"No paths to Pathnode X\" : Just what it says: there\
      \ are no paths from the pathnode specified.  To solve this issue, add pathnodes\
      \ to connect the node in question to the rest of the network.  Occurs when paths\
      \ are forced from this pathnode, or when a pathnode is at the top of a steep\
      \ drop.  Often occurs in conjunction with the previous error.\n; \"Pathnode\
      \ X is too close to Pathnode Y\" : You may have accidentally duplicated a pathnode;\
      \ just move one of the offending pathnodes away or delete it.  This error always\
      \ occurs in pairs.\n; \"May be too close to other navigation points\" : The\
      \ actor highlighted adds to the bot path network, but is likely colliding with\
      \ other bot path network actors, like NavigationPoints or Pickups.  Delete or\
      \ move the highlighted actor or ones close to it.  Too many NavigationPoint\
      \ actors too close together will cause AI navigation problems in game.\n\n====Map\
      \ Check Errors====\n; \"Only X Playerstarts in map!\" : Probably occurs if there\
      \ are less playerstarts in the map than the maximum playercount.\n; \"Paths\
      \ need to be rebuilt\" : Exactly what it says: rebuild your botpathing network.\
      \  This error will be shown if you use the Map Check tool after changing anything\
      \ in the botpathing network until you rebuild paths.\n; \"Path to Pathnode X\
      \ is very long&ndash;place a pathnode in between.\" : This error even gives\
      \ you the solution: There are close to 1024 units between Pathnodes X and Y,\
      \ and it's a little to far for bots to navigate comfortably.  Place a pathnode\
      \ between the two offending nodes to solve this issue.  Often occurs in pairs.\n\
      ; \"Playerstart not useable\" : Occurs if a playerstart is either hanging in\
      \ midair, sitting on a mover or nonsolid brush, or embedded in a solid space.\
      \  Often coincides with other similar errors.  To fix, find the offending playerstart\
      \ and move it to an appropriate location.\n; \"TriggerLightX bNoDelete false,\
      \ but is bNoDelete by default - map will fail in netplay\" : You've set the\
      \ Advanced>>bNoDelete property to False on a TriggerLight actor.  This is not\
      \ allowed because TriggerLights are hardcoded to be bNoDelete=True.  Simply\
      \ reset bNoDelete to True to fix this issue.\n\n===Build Errors===\n; \"Brush\
      \ X has NULL material references\" (Map Check and Rebuild Error): You did not\
      \ apply a texture to a brush.  Don't be too alarmed, because it will still have\
      \ the default engine texture.  This is not an issue that must be fixed (but\
      \ it's probably a good idea).  Note that the Map Check error does not specify\
      \ the brush.\n\n===Lighting Errors===\n; \"There are no lights in this map!\"\
      \ (Map Check Error only): If you need help to figure this one out, you should\
      \ probably give up mapping right now.\n\n==Related Topics==\n* [[Legacy:Rebuild|Rebuild]]\n\
