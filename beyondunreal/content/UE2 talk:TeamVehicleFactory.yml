      <p><b>SuperApe</b>: Originally this actor included a bForceAllow option that\
      \ overrode the Level.bAllowVehicles setting. Since the latest patch to UT2004\
      \ moved that check up to SVehicle, that will not work anymore. Alas, that very\
      \ cool option to include vehicles in any gametype would have to be left out.&#160;:(\
      \ Now, I offer it as simply a way to get any vehicle class into gametypes which\
      \ *do* allow vehicles. Enjoy!&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> Why couldn't\
      \ you just set the bAllowVehicles property through the code?</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ You mean like this?</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\"\

      \ Yes, something like that&#160;:P&#160;:) Good luck.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ No luck. I believe the new patch for 2k4 moved many of the bAllowVehicle checks\
      \ either higher in the actor heirarchy, or like into SVehicle itself.</p>\n\
      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> A request has been made by a mapper for Red Orchestra to\
      \ include a Reset() function for this actor. If you have a triggered version\
      \ of this factory and the map is reset, any outstanding vehicles are still there.\
      \ Working...</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> I've added the Reset() function that should\
      \ work fine. In fact, I had difficulty duplicating the problem of a stranded\
      \ vehicle after map reset. Nevertheless, this Reset() function won't hurt and\
      \ it may solve the problem for the Red Orchestra mapper.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
      \ Thanks to a suggestion by ZedMaestro on the BUF, I've added a feature for\
      \ spawning random vehicle classes. Just set bRandomSpawn = true and the list\
      \ of possible vehicle classes in RandomVehicles. Also, in relation to the above\
      \ discussion about forcing to allow vehicles in any gametype, there is a <a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://unrealplayground.com/forums/showthread.php?t=34314\"\
      >SuperVehicleFactory</a> in testing on the UnrealPlayground forums.</p>\n<p><b>VitalOverdose:</b>\
      \ when i got cut offline i took a whole buch of the most difficult problems\
      \ from atari forums and wiki and decided to crack each one as i was gonna be\
      \ ofline for atleast 4months.your teamvehiclefactory idea was on i decided to\
      \ have a go at.As far as i can see it does everything you specified in the orignal\
      \ design spec. i was thinking between us we could come up with an ultimate solution\
      \ but if not np.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> I think I understand the confusion.\
      \ The TeamVehicleFactory is not a problem which I am trying to find a solution\
      \ for, it is a custom actor I've posted on the wiki after testing thoroughly\
      \ and developing somewhere else. I post it here for others to use at their discretion,\
      \ as a Third-Party component. If you would like to take the code, use it in\
      \ a custom map, or even expand on it and modify it for specific purposes, that's\
      \ fine by me. That's why I posted it here. Just remember, the normal etiquette\
      \ is to give credit for the source in those situations, either in the map's\
      \ readme file or the code's initial comment block, or both. If you would like\
      \ help finding a solution to a problem you're having with your own code, I suggest\
      \ posting (in brief) the problem's details on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Help_Desk\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Help Desk\">Help Desk</a>. Personally, I wasn't at all clear\
      \ what you wanted help with. But at any rate, that code didn't belong here in\
      \ the Discussion of this page. Thanks for moving it.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Moofed:</b>\
      \ I noticed the first vehicle that is spawned from a TeamVehicleFactory doesn't\
      \ have a HeadlightProjector, but all vehicles afterwards do. Not sure what's\
      \ causing it.&#160;:-/</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Hmm. I'm not seeing that bug.\
      \ Headlights are spawned from the vehicle (ONSVehicle) during PostNetBeginPlay().\
      \ Can't think of why your first vehicle wouldn't have them when you jump in.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Moofed:</b> Fixed by setting PreSpawnTime=2. I think bDropDetail gets\
      \ set (and the coronas and projectors not spawned) because the computer is bogged\
      \ down by the level loading, which happens to be at the same time as the vehicles\
      \ are spawning when using bAutoSpawn.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Ah, that makes\
      \ more sense. Without including a default spawn effect, that is a potential\
      \ problem with this script. I didn't see it due to the effects I include in\
      \ the test map, linked to above. Perhaps I should add the suggested spawn effects\
      \ as a small block of code. Thanks.&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> I believe\
      \ the Reset() function does absolutely nothing. Vehicles themselves have their\
      \ own Reset() functon, so it's redundant, IIRC. I will update the code with\
      \ defaultproperties and include code for a default spawning Effects class to\
      \ use with this factory as an option, so that mappers can choose to use custom\
      \ spawning efx or not.</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> This class is included in <a\
      \ href=\"/User:SuperApe/Old_Skool_Monsta_Toolz\" title=\"User:SuperApe/Old Skool\
      \ Monsta Toolz\">Old Skool Monsta Toolz</a> and adds the feature of bDefaultEFX,\
      \ which spawns particles and sounds that indicate the team the vehicle is spawning\
      \ for and the size of the vehicle about to spawn. I will update the code to\
      \ match OSMT.TeamVehicleFactory soon.</p>\n<hr />\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\n\
