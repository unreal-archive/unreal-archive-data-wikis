  title: "Legacy:Terrain Texture Layer"
  text:
    text: "<p>A <a href=\"/Legacy:Terrain\" title=\"Legacy:Terrain\">Terrain</a> can\
      \ contain a large number of <b>texture layers</b>. These allow different textures\
      \ to be visible (and blended!) in different areas of a terrain. For example,\
      \ a mountain might have snow on the tops; or a hillside might have gravel paths\
      \ across it.</p>\n<p>A texture layer therefore is really just two pieces of\
      \ information: the name of the texture to display on the layer, and the name\
      \ of the texture that is the alpha map for the layer's visibility. This second\
      \ texture is what determines where the first texture is visible.</p>\n<p>Layers\
      \ have a stacking order, so newer layers cover up the older ones. You can change\
      \ the order of layers after you've created them.</p>\n<p>The list of layers\
      \ is shown in two places:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the Terrain Editing Window, where\
      \ you can edit how much and where each layer is visible. Note that the top layer\
      \ in the list is the bottom-most in the rendering order (or the one rendered\

      <dd>whatever you want, but it's a good idea to use a name which reflects the\
      \ layer you're going to make. Later on in the Terrain Mode window, this name\
      \ is what will be the name of your layer. 'Layer1' will do, or 'RockLayer' or\
      \ 'SandLayer' for example. If you're using several different terrains in your\
      \ map, you might want thee name to reflect that too, eg 'SandDune-Pebbles',\
      \ 'Hill-Path', 'BlueBase-Rocky'.</dd>\n<dt>Alpha Height &amp; Alpha Width&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>The height &amp; width of the texture you're about to create. These values\
      \ must match the dimensions of the heightmap for your terrain, unless you are\
      \ using UScale &amp; VScale to scale up. These are listed in the wrong order:\
      \ the 'y' dimension before the 'x', but since non-square layers make UnrealEd\
      \ crash, it doesn't really matter.</dd>\n<dt>Alpha fill&#160;</dt>\n<dd>colour\
      \ to fill in the alpha map initially. Pick black to start with a totally invisible\
      \ layer, white for a totally visible one.</dd>\n<dt>Color Fill&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>For color fill, I believe this is the color that will 'Fade' in to the other\
      \ layers when you paint the texture on. This must be a different color for each\
      \ layer. (Example: A layer's color fill cannot be the same as another layers\
      \ color fill. Ie. Red-Red is wrong and Red-Blue will work great )&#160;?????</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<p>Frankie C: Not a bad thought...but actually, the first texture layer\
      \ color should be white, with other layer colors typically being black. The\
      \ concept revolves around opacity (alpha channels, for those familiar), similar\
      \ to making a displacement map in other applications (i.e., white is opaque,\
      \ black is transparent, and the gray scale works as a varying level of transparency).</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>UScale &amp; VScale&#160;</dt>\n<dd>These determine how the display\
      \ texture is scaled when it is applied to the terrain. It works exactly like\
      \ the <a href=\"/Legacy:Surface_Properties\" title=\"Legacy:Surface Properties\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\">surface properties</a> under the tab Pan/Rot/Scale.\
      \ You can also apply a pan to the display texture in the layer properties once\
      \ you've created it.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>Finally, when you are satisfied with your\
      \ new layer's settings, click OK.</p>\n<p>There should now be a new layer in\
      \ the list. It should be visible in UnrealEd immediately, though you might need\
      \ to move around, or make a change to the terrain such as painting the height\
      \ or the layer for UnrealEd to \"wake up\".</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ I have been following the tutorials to learn UEd3.0 recently and have encountered\
      \ a problem painting texture layers. My textures paint onto the terrain in large\
      \ blocks that are solid and not blended at all around the edges. It's almost\
      \ like pixel editing with really huge regions. I was wondering if you could\
      \ explain here or on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Painting_Terrain_Tool\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Painting Terrain Tool\">Painting_Terrain_Tool</a> page how to go about\
      \ making smoothly blended texture layers.</p>\n<p><b>FreshMeat:</b> I don't\
      \ understand. How do you make sure the lower points have, for instance, a road\
      \ like texture while the ones slightly higher than that would be dirt, and the\
      \ ones higher than that would be grass? Specifically, how do you controll how\
      \ high a surface has to be in order to be a road?</p>\n<p><b>Still Freshmeat:</b>\
      \ hm.. are there 16 layers to match with each of the 16 colors in your grayscale\
      \ heightmap?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> You've got it all wrong. The height has\
      \ nothing to do with the texture. Each layer texture has its OWN alpha map that\
      \ shows how visible it is.</p>\n<p><b>FreshMeat:</b> Alright, I've followed\
      \ this step by step... but ctrl-right clicking seems to not paint a thing onto\
      \ my terrain at all... I think it has something to do with the alpha heightmap?\
      \ Can someone please edit this page to explain how things actually work and\
      \ what they do, rather than just saying \"for this example let's do this and\
      \ this\"? I'm not following along on a tutorial. I'm learning how to use the\
      \ editor, not this specific map. See, I had someone else make my greyscale so\
      \ I could see one in action (and I suck at photo editing), so how do you determine\
      \ what your alpha height and width should be?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> painting\
      \ terrain can be buggy. The size of your terrain alpha map (and it's NOT a height\
      \ map, if you say that I can't be sure of what you mean) should match the size\
      \ of the terrain height map (which IS a height map).</p>\n<p><b>Fresh:</b> So\
      \ then Alpha height and width refer to the alpha map in 2 dimensions. The two\
      \ dimensions of a flat texture, and not the three dimensions of the actuall\
      \ wireframe you're trying to paint? That makes alot more sense. Hmmmm, no, that\
      \ crashed my editor. someone please kindly further explain Alpha Height and\
      \ Alpha Width.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Ok, it seems Uscale and VScale (edited\
      \ – sorry, I got this wrong) have been defined differently in parts of this\
      \ page. These variables affect how the visible texture is stretched on the terrain.\
      \ There is nowhere to tell UnrealEd how to scale the texture layer alpha map\
      \ – it figures that out automatically. Eg, if I add a 32x32 texture layer to\
      \ a 128x128 terrain, there is no problem. it just means you won't have as fine\
      \ a resolution for your layer.</p>\n<p><b>FreshMeat:</b> So if my texture is\
      \ 512x512, that's what i should put into the alpha?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ Er... hang on, I think I've messed up even more. Uscale and VScale stretch\
      \ the visible texture. What texture are you talking about? AlphaHeight and AlphaWidth\
      \ have nothing to do with the visible texture. They define the size of the visibility\
      \ map you are about to create in the dialog box. If you already have a visibility\
      \ map, then you're not going to give an AlphaHeight and AlphaWidth.</p>\n<p><b>FreshMeat:</b>\
      \ someone apparently needs to go through and redo this page with consistant\
      \ terms and clear instructions. I have no idea what a \"visibility map\" is.\
      \ All I know is I have a wireframe view of my terrain from a heightmap, and\
      \ I would sincerly love to texture it, but I am hopelessly confused at this\
      \ section. My heightmap is 512x256. I have textures I wish to use, and I know\
      \ how to import them. I would like to make some grass, and a dirt path. I have\
      \ no idea how, and I begin to wonder if this is even possible. I can't even\
      \ get textures ON my wireframe, let alone on my wireframe where I want them.\
      \ If someone could kindly redo this page for someone who has essentially no\

  wikitext:
    text: "A [[Legacy:Terrain|Terrain]] can contain a large number of '''texture layers'''.\
      \ These allow different textures to be visible (and blended!) in different areas\
      \ of a terrain. For example, a mountain might have snow on the tops; or a hillside\
      \ might have gravel paths across it.\n\nA texture layer therefore is really\
      \ just two pieces of information: the name of the texture to display on the\
      \ layer, and the name of the texture that is the alpha map for the layer's visibility.\
      \ This second texture is what determines where the first texture is visible.\n\
      \nLayers have a stacking order, so newer layers cover up the older ones. You\
      \ can change the order of layers after you've created them.\n\nThe list of layers\
      \ is shown in two places:\n\n* in the Terrain Editing Window, where you can\
      \ edit how much and where each layer is visible. Note that the top layer in\
      \ the list is the bottom-most in the rendering order (or the one rendered first\
      \ if you prefer...)\n* in the [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]]'s [[Legacy:Actor\
      \ Properties|Actor Properties]], where you can change the other settings.\n\n\
      ==Add a terrain layer ==\n\nYou'll need to start by [[Legacy:Creating A Terrain|Creating\
      \ A Terrain]] :)\n\nThere are two ways to add a new layer to your terrain: \n\
      \n* use [[Legacy:Terrain Mode|Terrain mode]] if you don't have a alpha map you\
      \ wish to apply: it will create one for you which you can then edit with the\
      \ [[Legacy:Painting Terrain Tool|Painting Terrain Tool]].\n* use the [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]]'s\
      \ [[Legacy:Actor Properties Window|actor properties window]] if you have an\
      \ existing texture for the alpha map: for example, one you've made in an image\
      \ editing [[Legacy:Application|application]] and imported; or a duplicate of\
      \ the alpha map of another layer. (Of course you can edit this alpha map too\
      \ once the layer is made. But remember that this edits the alpha map texture,\
      \ so if it's in use elsewhere, that will reflect the changes too.)\n\n===...in\
      \ terrain mode===\n# In the [[Legacy:Texture Browser|Texture Browser]], select\
      \ a texture to be applied to the new layer. See the [[Legacy:Texture Package|Texture\
      \ Package]] list for suggestions. We'll call this the ''display texture''.\n\
      \n# Click on the [[Legacy:Terrain Mode|Terrain Mode]] button. The Terrain Mode\
      \ window opens.\n\n[[Image:Legacy_interface-Ed3-TerrainTool.png|center|]]\n\n\
      # In the 'Terrains' tab (halfway down the window), select from the list of TerrainInfos\
      \ the one that represents the terrain you wish to add a layer to.\n\n# Click\
      \ on the 'Layers' tab. You might need to click on the first empty layer in the\
      \ list to wake it up, but not always (and note that this part of the window\
      \ is a bit buggy and doesn't always react the first time to clicks). Click the\
      \ 'New...' button to the right. The New Layer window will open. You're about\
      \ to create a new [[Legacy:Texture|texture]] that will represent the alpha map\
      \ for the layer &ndash; where the layer is visible and how it is tinted.\n\n\
      ; [[Legacy:Package|Package]] : Where to store the alpha map texture. [[Legacy:MyLevel|MyLevel]]\
      \ works here of course, to allows you to store the texture inside your map file.\
      \ It's a good idea to place all the texture associated with your terrain in\
      \ the same place.\n; Group : whatever you like. It's a good idea to use something\
      \ meaningful like 'Terrain', which will keep the textures used by your terrain\
      \ apart from everything else.\n; Name : whatever you want, but it's a good idea\
      \ to use a name which reflects the layer you're going to make. Later on in the\
      \ Terrain Mode window, this name is what will be the name of your layer. 'Layer1'\
      \ will do, or 'RockLayer' or 'SandLayer' for example. If you're using several\
      \ different terrains in your map, you might want thee name to reflect that too,\
      \ eg 'SandDune-Pebbles', 'Hill-Path', 'BlueBase-Rocky'.\n; Alpha Height & Alpha\
      \ Width : The height & width of the texture you're about to create. These values\
      \ must match the dimensions of the heightmap for your terrain, unless you are\
      \ using UScale & VScale to scale up. These are listed in the wrong order: the\
      \ 'y' dimension before the 'x', but since non-square layers make UnrealEd crash,\
      \ it doesn't really matter.\n;  Alpha fill : colour to fill in the alpha map\
      \ initially. Pick black to start with a totally invisible layer, white for a\
      \ totally visible one. \n; Color Fill : For color fill, I believe this is the\
      \ color that will 'Fade' in to the other layers when you paint the texture on.\
      \ This must be a different color for each layer. (Example: A layer's color fill\
      \ cannot be the same as another layers color fill. Ie. Red-Red is wrong and\
      \ Red-Blue will work great ) ?????\n\nFrankie C: Not a bad thought...but actually,\
      \ the first texture layer color should be white, with other layer colors typically\
      \ being black. The concept revolves around opacity (alpha channels, for those\
      \ familiar), similar to making a displacement map in other applications (i.e.,\
      \ white is opaque, black is transparent, and the gray scale works as a varying\
      \ level of transparency).\n\n; UScale & VScale : These determine how the display\
      \ texture is scaled when it is applied to the terrain. It works exactly like\
      \ the [[Legacy:Surface Properties|surface properties]] under the tab Pan/Rot/Scale.\
      \ You can also apply a pan to the display texture in the layer properties once\
      \ you've created it.\n\nFinally, when you are satisfied with your new layer's\
      \ settings, click OK.\n\nThere should now be a new layer in the list. It should\
      \ be visible in UnrealEd immediately, though you might need to move around,\
      \ or make a change to the terrain such as painting the height or the layer for\
      \ UnrealEd to \"wake up\".\n\n===...in the TerrainInfo===\n\nIn the TerrainInfo's\
      \ [[Legacy:Actor Properties|Actor Properties]], expand the TerrainInfo -> Layers\
      \ array, and find the first empty array element. We'll refer to it as Layers[i]\
      \ below.\n\n[[Legacy:Set The Following Properties|Set the following properties]]:\n\
      \n* [[Legacy:Set The Resource Property|Set the resource property]] TerrainInfo\
      \ -> Layers[i] -> AlphaMap = whatever alpha map you want to use.\n* [[Legacy:Set\
      \ The Resource Property|Set the resource property]] TerrainInfo -> Layers[i]\
      \ -> Texture = the [[Legacy:Texture|texture]] the layer should display. (for\
      \ example snow, grass, rocks, etc. See [[Legacy:Texture Package|Texture Package]]\
      \ for suggestions of what to use)\n* TerrainInfo -> Layers[i] -> UScale and\
      \ VScale = however you want to scale the texture on the layer. 1 will do for\
      \ now.\n\n'''FreshMeat:''' Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is set by default,\
      \ correct?\n\n==Editing the layer==\n\n===Visibility===\n\nNow click on the\
      \ layer and then click on the [[Legacy:Painting Terrain Tool|Painting Terrain\
      \ Tool]] under the ' Terrain Editing Tools ' Menu. Now, on your terrain in your\
      \ level. Use the paint controls (CTR+LMB to erase the texture and CTR-RMB to\
      \ add the texture) on the area you want to change the texture to. depending\
      \ on the ' Strength ' you set, the texture will ' fade ' in covering the older\
      \ texture.\n\nIn the layer tab, you can right-click on a layer in the list,\
      \ and do:\n* Set alpha map from the current texture\n* Set display texture from\
      \ the current texture\n* Toggle grid display for the layer\n\n===Properties===\n\
      \nThese are in the [[Legacy:TerrainInfo|TerrainInfo]] -> Layers array.\n\n;\
      \ [[Legacy:Texture|Texture]] AlphaMap : the alpha map texture. \n; float KFriction\
      \ :  \n; float KRestitution :  \n; Rotator LayerRotation :  \n; [[Legacy:Material|Material]]\
      \ Texture :  the displayed texture\n; ETexMapAxis TextureMapAxis :  \n; float\
      \ TextureRotation :  \n; float UPan :  \n; float UScale :  \n; float VPan :\
      \  \n; float VScale : \n\n===Known bugs/nicks===\n\n'''When making the layers\
      \ you can get a result like this:'''\n\n[[Image:Legacy_la_terrain_trouble.jpeg|Legacy_la_terrain_trouble.jpeg]]\
      \ @inline@la_terrain_trouble_grid\n\nAs you can see in the grid image it just\
      \ fills the middle of every quad. To solve this you have to make sure all the\
      \ layers' alpha maps heightmap is the same size. This means that if your terrain\
      \ is 256x256, the size of that layer's alpha has to be 256x256, or if it's 128x128,\
      \ make sure the alpha of that texture layer is 128x128, etc...\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ I have no idea what these images are supposed to show. If nobody can explain,\
      \ I'll delete them.\n\n'''Anonymous:''' Whomever wrote this was trying to say\
      \ that if you don't set the Alpha Height and Width to an appropriate number\
      \ when creating a new layer, the fade out from the centre of the grid coordinate\
      \ to the edge won't be what you're expecting.  You can see that in the images\
      \ above, where the grass texture only shows up as a dot in the middle. I could\
      \ be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the best bet is to match the alpha size of the\
      \ layer you're painting with to the same number as the terrain sector size.\
      \  I think they also try to say that here, but not very clearly.\n\nThis means\
      \ you '''can not''' have different sizes despite the obvious reason for having\
      \ them (optimizing).\n\n'''Anonymous:''' Yes this is very important and something\
      \ that I just encountered..... You must set the alpha height of the the texture\
      \ to the same as the terrain otherwise when you paint textures they will come\
      \ up strangely spotty.\n\n==Comments==\n\nCould someone please clarify these\
      \ steps with some screenshots?  I'm totally confused.  I tried to paint a texture\
      \ on to my terrain, but I still only see the terrain in wireframe view.  How\
      \ do I know it's working?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' How's that? I've cleaned up the\
      \ instructions, going through it myself in the ed.\n\nMake sure the texture\
      \ is RGB8, it wont show up otherwise.\n\n'''Bob_The_Beheader:''' I think that\
      \ it would be a good idea to have some tips on exactly how to go about painting\
      \ the terrain. I mean, what looks good asthetically, how much blending there\
      \ should be, that sort of think. I think this may apply to other topics as well.\n\
      \n'''Anonymous:''' I have been following the tutorials to learn UEd3.0 recently\
      \ and have encountered a problem painting texture layers. My textures paint\
      \ onto the terrain in large blocks that are solid and not blended at all around\
      \ the edges. It's almost like pixel editing with really huge regions. I was\
      \ wondering if you could explain here or on the [[Legacy:Painting_Terrain_Tool|Painting_Terrain_Tool]]\
      \ page how to go about making smoothly blended texture layers.\n\n'''FreshMeat:'''\
      \ I don't understand. How do you make sure the lower points have, for instance,\
      \ a road like texture while the ones slightly higher than that would be dirt,\
      \ and the ones higher than that would be grass? Specifically, how do you controll\
      \ how high a surface has to be in order to be a road?\n\n'''Still Freshmeat:'''\
      \ hm.. are there 16 layers to match with each of the 16 colors in your grayscale\
      \ heightmap?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' You've got it all wrong. The height has nothing\
      \ to do with the texture. Each layer texture has its OWN alpha map that shows\
      \ how visible it is.\n\n'''FreshMeat:''' Alright, I've followed this step by\
      \ step... but ctrl-right clicking seems to not paint a thing onto my terrain\
      \ at all... I think it has something to do with the alpha heightmap? Can someone\
      \ please edit this page to explain how things actually work and what they do,\
      \ rather than just saying \"for this example let's do this and this\"? I'm not\
      \ following along on a tutorial. I'm learning how to use the editor, not this\
      \ specific map. See, I had someone else make my greyscale so I could see one\
      \ in action (and I suck at photo editing), so how do you determine what your\
      \ alpha height and width should be?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' painting terrain can be\
      \ buggy. The size of your terrain alpha map (and it's NOT a height map, if you\
      \ say that I can't be sure of what you mean) should match the size of the terrain\
      \ height map (which IS a height map). \n\n'''Fresh:''' So then Alpha height\
      \ and width refer to the alpha map in 2 dimensions. The two dimensions of a\
      \ flat texture, and not the three dimensions of the actuall wireframe you're\
      \ trying to paint? That makes alot more sense.  Hmmmm, no, that crashed my editor.\
      \ someone please kindly further explain Alpha Height and Alpha Width.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Ok, it seems Uscale and VScale (edited &ndash; sorry, I got this wrong) have\
      \ been defined differently in parts of this page. These variables affect how\
      \ the visible texture is stretched on the terrain. There is nowhere to tell\
      \ UnrealEd how to scale the texture layer alpha map &ndash; it figures that\
      \ out automatically. Eg, if I add a 32x32 texture layer to a 128x128 terrain,\
      \ there is no problem. it just means you won't have as fine a resolution for\
      \ your layer.\n\n'''FreshMeat:''' So if my texture is 512x512, that's what i\
      \ should put into the alpha?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Er... hang on, I think I've messed\
      \ up even more. Uscale and VScale stretch the visible texture. What texture\
      \ are you talking about? AlphaHeight and AlphaWidth have nothing to do with\
      \ the visible texture. They define the size of the visibility map you are about\
      \ to create in the dialog box. If you already have a visibility map, then you're\
      \ not going to give an AlphaHeight and AlphaWidth.\n\n'''FreshMeat:''' someone\
      \ apparently needs to go through and redo this page with consistant terms and\
      \ clear instructions. I have no idea what a \"visibility map\" is. All I know\
      \ is I have a wireframe view of my terrain from a heightmap, and I would sincerly\
      \ love to texture it, but I am hopelessly confused at this section. My heightmap\
      \ is 512x256. I have textures I wish to use, and I know how to import them.\
      \ I would like to make some grass, and a dirt path. I have no idea how, and\
      \ I begin to wonder if this is even possible. I can't even get textures ON my\
      \ wireframe, let alone on my wireframe where I want them. If someone could kindly\
      \ redo this page for someone who has essentially no idea what any of the terms\
      \ actually mean, I would be eternaly grateful.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' \"A texture\
      \ layer therefore really just two pieces of information: which texture is the\
      \ alpha map for the layer's visibility, and which texture is displayed on the\
      \ layer.\" What part of this don't you get? I've tried to make it clearer.\n\
      \n'''Tinn:''' Well, the lack of a verb before the colon makes the sentence itself\
      \ a bit confusing...\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
