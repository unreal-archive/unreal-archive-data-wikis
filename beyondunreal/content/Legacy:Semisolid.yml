      \ could:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>make a specially-shaped brush and subract it, like the\

      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Intersect\" title=\"Legacy:Intersect\">intersection</a>\
      \ or with the <a href=\"/Legacy:2D_Shape_Editor\" title=\"Legacy:2D Shape Editor\"\

      \ cuts like the bottom left picture in the BSP. These diagonal cuts (in green)\
      \ will probably extend into the rest of the area you're working in and maybe\

      \ happens with method 3. The original cube isn't filled in: the area shaded\

      \ see it if you type <i>ghost</i> into the <a href=\"/Legacy:UT_Console\" title=\"\

      \ to block players and projectiles on this.</p>\n<p>The net result is that the\
      \ off-grid shapes are kept localised to a small portion of the BSP tree. The\
      \ BSP at large is still based on cubes with integer points.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      <p><b>Anonymous:</b> so, if making semisolids is easy and doesn't tax the engine\
      \ as much why would anybody ever use the add button? Should all of the pillars\
      \ and statues and decorations and whatnot be in semisolid form?</p>\n<p><b>inio:</b>\
      \ Semisolids are sorta equivalent to static meshes, only they don't get the\
      \ on-card geometry caching and such. You can't use them to seal off zones (I\
      \ don't think), and they create overdraw (because they don't cut the polygons\
      \ they intersect). They're good for pillars and stairs and such. There's lots\
      \ of semisolids in my CTF-Peach original UT map (<a href=\"/Legacy:Inio\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Inio\">availble here</a>) for stars and such. There's still plenty of\
      \ adds though.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Exactly. You still use adds for all sorts\
      \ of neat CSG stuff. Also for things players walk on, since semisolids can sometimes\
      \ be unreliable for this.</p>\n<p><b>Anonymous:</b> so use them for surfaces\
      \ that players/bots will not walk on and pillars and things? What's <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:CSG\" title=\"Legacy:CSG\">CSG</a> stuff?</p>\n<p><b>Sobiwan:</b> CSG\
      \ is added or subtracted brushes that cut up the BSP world.</p>\n<p><b>Anonymous:</b>\
      \ actually, <b>inio,</b> i think you can use semisolids to zone off areas. unless\
      \ of course once again i have made some obvious mistake...</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b>\
      \ I'm pretty sure they can't.</p>\n<p><b>inio:</b> He might be right to some\
      \ extent. If a node is completely contained within a semisolid, it gets put\
      \ into zone 0, so I think there may be some zoning going on with semisolids.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Ragdoll:</b> Could someone please verify \"only things the player wont\
      \ touch\" statement? I use semisolids as much as possible and never see any\
      \ errors provided they are not touching other semisolids or nonsolids.</p>\n\
      <p><b>zugy:</b> It seems, at least in my experience, if something might cause\
      \ a bsp error as a solid, but doesn't as a semi, there's a chance the semi won't\
      \ have collision. But I can't think of a reason to not use a semi if a player\
      \ might touch something if in testing it has collision.</p>\n<p><b>Ju.L.Mo:</b>\
      \ I'm a beginner, so I was just wondering a few things: If you place semi-solids\
      \ in place of things the player won't touch, then does that mean that making\
      \ a platform a semi-solid allow me to walk through it in the game? If so, can't\
      \ I shoot through semi-solids?</p>\n<p><b>Hellkeeper:</b> A semi solid brush\
      \ DOES have a collision and it stops Players and projectiles in the exact same\
      \ way as a normal solid brush would. If a semi Solid has no collision, it's\
      \ a bug, probably caused by a bad BSP cut. You can use a semisolid as a platform,\
      \ wall or pillar, as long as it doesn't intersect with anoter brush.</p>\n\n\

      \ the touching brushes to make them one brush.\n\nSee also:\n* [[Legacy:Semisolid\

      \n===How Semisolids reduce node count ===\n\nHere's a simple example of a situation\
      \ where you'd use a semisolid & why it's good. \n\n[[Image:Legacy_semisolid.example.roundedcorner.gif|center|]]\n\
      \nLet's say you want to round off a corner. You could:\n# make a specially-shaped\
      \ brush and subract it, like the yellow crescent-type shape top left in the\
      \ diagram. (this would be done by [[Legacy:Intersect|intersection]] or with\

      \ the map's [[Legacy:Node Count|node count]].\n\nThe picture in the bottom right\
      \ shows what happens with method 3. The original cube isn't filled in: the area\
      \ shaded in grey is still part of the map. You could walk into the curved wall\
      \ and see it if you type ''ghost'' into the [[Legacy:UT Console|UT console]].\
      \ The engine sees the floor of that cube as a full square, just as if you hadn't\

      \ to seal off zones (I don't think), and they create overdraw (because they\
      \ don't cut the polygons they intersect).  They're good for pillars and stairs\
      \ and such.  There's lots of semisolids in my CTF-Peach original UT map ([[Legacy:Inio|availble\
      \ here]]) for stars and such.  There's still plenty of adds though.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Exactly. You still use adds for all sorts of neat CSG stuff. Also for things\
      \ players walk on, since semisolids can sometimes be unreliable for this.\n\n\
      '''Anonymous:''' so use them for surfaces that players/bots will not walk on\
      \ and pillars and things? What's [[Legacy:CSG|CSG]] stuff? \n\n'''Sobiwan:'''\
      \ CSG is added or subtracted brushes that cut up the BSP world.  \n\n'''Anonymous:'''\
      \ actually, '''inio,''' i think you can use semisolids to zone off areas. unless\
      \ of course once again i have made some obvious mistake...\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ I'm pretty sure they can't.\n\n'''inio:''' He might be right to some extent.\
      \  If a node is completely contained within a semisolid, it gets put into zone\
      \ 0, so I think there may be some zoning going on with semisolids.\n\n'''Ragdoll:'''\
      \ Could someone please verify \"only things the player wont touch\" statement?\
      \ I use semisolids as much as possible and never see any errors provided they\
      \ are not touching other semisolids or nonsolids. \n\n'''zugy:''' It seems,\
      \ at least in my experience, if something might cause a bsp error as a solid,\
      \ but doesn't as a semi, there's a chance the semi won't have collision. But\
      \ I can't think of a reason to not use a semi if a player might touch something\
      \ if in testing it has collision.\n\n'''Ju.L.Mo:''' I'm a beginner, so I was\
      \ just wondering a few things: If you place semi-solids in place of things the\
      \ player won't touch, then does that mean that making a platform a semi-solid\
      \ allow me to walk through it in the game? If so, can't I shoot through semi-solids?\n\
      \n'''Hellkeeper:''' A semi solid brush DOES have a collision and it stops Players\
      \ and projectiles in the exact same way as a normal solid brush would. If a\
      \ semi Solid has no collision, it's a bug, probably caused by a bad BSP cut.\
      \ You can use a semisolid as a platform, wall or pillar, as long as it doesn't\
      \ intersect with anoter brush.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Mapping|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
