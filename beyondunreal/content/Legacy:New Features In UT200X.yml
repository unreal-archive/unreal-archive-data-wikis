      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>\"The particle system in UT2003 looks just amazing.\
      \ UT just faked it, with particle meshes and animated sprites. UT2003 has a\
      \ real true-to-life particle system, that lets you do sprite, mesh, or beam\
      \ emitters. The beam emitters they showed us were used to make very cool lightning\
      \ effects (and is likely what they use to do the lightning gun's electrical\
      \ effects). I imagine it can also be used for lasers and similar things. Mesh\
      \ and sprite emitters really only differ in the type of particles they create.\
      \ A sprite particle draws a particular texture at its location, a mesh particle\
      \ draws a fully skinned mesh. In either case, you have a great deal of control\
      \ over the particles, including their scale, color, and velocity at varying\
      \ points in time. The particle system in UT2003 looks to be so versatile and\
      \ adaptive that you can probably spend days creating particle effects and no\
      \ two will be alike.\"</p>\n<p>Source: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external\
      \ text\" href=\"http://www.rps.net/NE/\">Nights Edge</a></p>\n<p>Lee Perry (Epic)on\
      \ Polycount:</p>\n<p>\"but even if they're {they were talking about spacewarps\
      \ to modify particles} not in our system, DE's system is still in the engine\
      \ as well, and both are full-function.\"</p>\n<p>So there appears to be 2 particle\
      \ systems&#160;:)</p>\n<p><b>Githianki:</b> I posted the above Lee Perry quote\
      \ on a special mod makers thread over on Polycount where Lee Perry as eepers\
      \ (:)) hands out info. He comfirmed that yes there are two complete particle\
      \ implementations.</p>\n<p>\"Gith,</p>\n<p>Yeah there's 2 particle systems,\
      \ Emitters and xEmitters (DE's system). You can use either in levels with no\
      \ probs. Xemitters still have the ability to be moved around by force effecting\
      \ things like rockets. DM-Compressed has some steam vents that do this I believe.</p>\n\
      <p>The UDN docs should cover our system, I'm not sure if DE has a tutorial for\
      \ theirs planned or not, but they're both generally easy to use. I heartily\
      \ reccomend not making effects from scratch, but instead snagging them from\
      \ other levels, then editing them to what you want customized. The fields in\
      \ properties are relatively self explanatory and the effects update realtime\
      \ in the editor, so it's pretty easy to jack around with.</p>\n<p>There's no\
      \ vertex manipulation such as the explosion thing you mentioned, I'm not sure\
      \ where that story came from, sorry, I haven't heard that before.</p>\n<p>There's\
      \ not a real way to use karma on bits right now without significant code/scripting\
      \ work for a mod, future engine games may have that but UT2k3 doesn't have that\
      \ implemented easily right now. Would be nice, but we weren't ready to hold\
      \ the game's release to implement functions we didn't actually use on the game's\
      \ shipping characters.</p>\n<p>Maybe James has some more insight...\"</p>\n\
      <p>and from BigSquid (James):</p>\n<p>\"Regarding dangling Karma stuff from\
      \ character - as Lee says you can't really do that right now. It will probably\
      \ be too tricky to add in at this point, but I will look into it if I get a\
      \ chance...\"</p>\n<p>The vertex thing was something I asked about a thread\
      \ discussion in the BeyondUnreal forums where someone posted a pic that sure\
      \ as heck looked like it had this. Various previews of Unreal 2 mentiond a similar\
      \ feature so I thought I'd ask. U2 is a diff engine though (sort of).</p>\n\

      \ some stuff on it about terrain.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> The link there has\

      \ I ran it and noticed the banner at the top.</p>\n<p><b>UsAaR33</b>: But basically,\
      \ I can put anything I do know about the \"new features\" of UT2003, regardless\
      \ of how I got such \"information\"?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Well, there are\
      \ <i>some</i> that have legitimate means of knowing those things (and some of\
      \ it is public knowledge too). &#160;:-) Posting information gathered from illegally\
      \ obtained software isn't endorsed, in any case.</p>\n<p><b>UsAaR33:</b> Well,\

      \ you can say anything you know about it. However, if you're not, but you found\
      \ out things using 'dodgy' methods (leaked version, talking to someone who was\
      \ under NDA), then I'd say you probably ought not to say. If you are under NDA,\
      \ then you're not allowed to say anything which has not already been made public.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> I've changed the top of this page to reflect that. Hugh,\
      \ feel free to change it again if it needs it.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> As for\
      \ NDAs: The one Epic had the people on the <a href=\"/Legacy:UT2003/Mod_Summit\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UT2003/Mod Summit\">UT2003/Mod Summit</a> sign technically\
      \ disallowed disclosure of any information obtained on the summit to anyone\
      \ outside the invited mod teams, but Tim Sweeney expressly told us at the end\
      \ of the summit that we were free to talk about it publicly, and that the NDA's\
      \ main purpose was to prevent software leaks.</p>\n<p><b>DJPaul:</b> If, in\
      \ theory, I knew someone with a leaked build of UT2003, in theory, and I stole\
      \ a look at the class file, would the data gathered be postable on the Wiki\
      \ or considered \"hands-off\"? Remember, this is in theory and I don't have\
      \ it, so no accusing.</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> It would be considered hands-off.\
      \ We're not going to embrace the use of stolen software, neither directly nor\
      \ indirectly.</p>\n<p><b>Highlander:</b> I have been wondering, Due to the use\
      \ of static meshes in maps, would it be better to go for a granular / modular\
      \ approch for making meshs. For example: instead of making a large support beam\
      \ (one of those made from cylinders if you know what i mean) make the cylinders\
      \ as meshes and simply use them to make the support beam in unrealed(scaled\
      \ &amp; rotated etc etc...). I realise the memory footprint of lotsa identical\
      \ smaller meshes would be less (i think). But would there be a performance hit\
      \ in fps from having to render \"more\" objects?</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Well...\
      \ using many different low-poly meshes is worse for performance than using a\
      \ single high-poly one many times, I believe. As for modularity, settle for\
      \ what makes sense: That would be (in my opinion, in most cases) neither building\
      \ an entire map as a static mesh nor making 3D primitives to be combined in\
      \ UnrealEd but, in your example, building that support beam as a single static\
      \ mesh.</p>\n<p><b>Highlander:</b> Another question would be what is happening\
      \ with collision in ut2k3? is it still cylinders? or can we create arbitary\
      \ shapes for collision? (do we even still have the option of cylinders?)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> See <a href=\"/Legacy:Hardware_Brush\" title=\"Legacy:Hardware\
      \ Brush\">Hardware Brush</a>. (Collision cylinders are only for actors, and\
      \ static meshes aren't technically related to Unreal Tournament's <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:Decoration\" title=\"Legacy:Decoration\">Decoration</a> meshes anymore.)</p>\n\
      <hr />\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> So how are we going to handle UT2003 stuff then?\
      \ Has a decision been made yet. From all accounts (and this is all based upon\
      \ rumor, speculation, and the odd fact here and there) the class hierarchy for\
      \ UT2003 is pretty different to that of UT. It also sounds like a lot of the\
      \ classes have tweaked (or changed) functionality as well. Although it does\
      \ seem like the game isn't due out any time soon now, I think we'll wind up\
      \ having to keep most of the script-type information seperate from the UT stuff.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> This has been discussed at length in a now lost thread in\
      \ the Unreal Wiki forum. We haven't found a conclusive answer yet, but your\
      \ input would certainly be welcome.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b> Thanks. I always\
      \ forget about the Wiki forums.</p>\n<p><b>Luggage:</b> Better check this whole\
      \ thread: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~polycount/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006636.html\"\
      >PolyCount's Mod Summit thread</a></p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> quote from that thread:\
      \ \"as well as a bunch of non-descript europeans or something\"&#160;!!!</p>\n\
      <p><b>Githianki:</b> I've added some info I confirmed about the particle systems.\
      \ Someone should go through here (who can do a complete list) and re-factor\
      \ and clean out obviously old comments.</p>\n<p>AS for the mesh questions, recall\
      \ that each mesh has an overhead so the overall number of dicreet and distinct\
      \ meshes is what impacts performance (along with tex obviously) not necessarily\
      \ the number of instances of any one of those meshes or the number of polys\
      \ in one of those meshes. That said lots of instances of a huge variety of of\
      \ high poly meshes will have a big performance impact over a few instances,\
      \ of a few, low poly meshes. The least important factor is the poly count of\
      \ a mesh since the poly numbers that can be thrown around are enormous.</p>\n\
      <p><b>GRAFIK:</b> Seen as how UT2003 differs little in terms of engine features,\
      \ instead of having seperate <a href=\"/edit/Legacy:New_Features_In_UT2004?redlink=1\"\

      \ Since the 2004 page doesn't exist, yup. Might as well rename this one to 200x\
      \ and link all the more spcific new feature lists from here.</p>\n<p><b>GRAFIK:</b>\

      \ on \"broken/removed features in UT200X\", like warp zones, mirrors, and even\
      \ vaguely advanced dynamic lighting (no, projectors do not replace that as they\
      \ don't actually cast light, and \"casting shadow\" is an unnecessarily complex\
      \ ugly kludge; bDynamic doesn't work for animation effects like rotation)? I\
      \ don't mean a whole new node, but just another heading on this one.</p>\n<p><b>Evilmrfran:</b>\
      \ There is one big difference in the old and new editors. The Unreal Ed 2.0\

      \ ==\n\n\"The particle system in UT2003 looks just amazing. UT just faked it,\
      \ with particle meshes and animated sprites. UT2003 has a real true-to-life\
      \ particle system, that lets you do sprite, mesh, or beam emitters. The beam\
      \ emitters they showed us were used to make very cool lightning effects (and\
      \ is likely what they use to do the lightning gun's electrical effects). I imagine\
      \ it can also be used for lasers and similar things. Mesh and sprite emitters\
      \ really only differ in the type of particles they create. A sprite particle\
      \ draws a particular texture at its location, a mesh particle draws a fully\
      \ skinned mesh. In either case, you have a great deal of control over the particles,\
      \ including their scale, color, and velocity at varying points in time. The\
      \ particle system in UT2003 looks to be so versatile and adaptive that you can\
      \ probably spend days creating particle effects and no two will be alike.\"\n\
      \nSource: [http://www.rps.net/NE/ Nights Edge]\n\nLee Perry (Epic)on Polycount:\n\
      \n\"but even if they're {they were talking about spacewarps to modify particles}\
      \ not in our system, DE's system is still in the engine as well, and both are\
      \ full-function.\"\n\nSo there appears to be 2 particle systems :)\n\n'''Githianki:'''\
      \ I posted the above Lee Perry quote on a special mod makers thread over on\
      \ Polycount where Lee Perry as eepers (:)) hands out info.  He comfirmed that\
      \ yes there are two complete particle implementations.\n\n\"Gith, \n\nYeah there's\
      \ 2 particle systems, Emitters and xEmitters (DE's system). You can use either\
      \ in levels with no probs. Xemitters still have the ability to be moved around\
      \ by force effecting things like rockets. DM-Compressed has some steam vents\
      \ that do this I believe.\n\nThe UDN docs should cover our system, I'm not sure\
      \ if DE has a tutorial for theirs planned or not, but they're both generally\
      \ easy to use. I heartily reccomend not making effects from scratch, but instead\
      \ snagging them from other levels, then editing them to what you want customized.\
      \ The fields in properties are relatively self explanatory and the effects update\
      \ realtime in the editor, so it's pretty easy to jack around with.\n\nThere's\
      \ no vertex manipulation such as the explosion thing you mentioned, I'm not\
      \ sure where that story came from, sorry, I haven't heard that before.\n\nThere's\
      \ not a real way to use karma on bits right now without significant code/scripting\
      \ work for a mod, future engine games may have that but UT2k3 doesn't have that\
      \ implemented easily right now. Would be nice, but we weren't ready to hold\
      \ the game's release to implement functions we didn't actually use on the game's\
      \ shipping characters.\n\nMaybe James has some more insight...\"\n\nand from\
      \ BigSquid (James):\n\n\"Regarding dangling Karma stuff from character - as\
      \ Lee says you can't really do that right now. It will probably be too tricky\
      \ to add in at this point, but I will look into it if I get a chance...\"\n\n\
      The vertex thing was something I asked about a thread discussion in the BeyondUnreal\
      \ forums where someone posted a pic that sure as heck looked like it had this.\
      \  Various previews of Unreal 2 mentiond a similar feature so I thought I'd\
      \ ask. U2 is a diff engine though (sort of).\n\n==External References ==\n\n\

      \ to know this? :p  Can people just put any information they know about UT2K3\
      \ or what?\n\n'''Dma:'''  We don't know how we know this.  Mainly rumor and\
      \ hearsay.  Try googling for DynamicActors or something.  UDN does have some\
      \ stuff on it about terrain.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  The link there has a list of\
      \ new features, but it's a bit old. I'm hoping that with a rough list here we'll\
      \ have an idea of what to write new pages about when we get the demo. :D\n\n\
      '''EntropicLqd:'''  Arrrrgh!  Stop making me impatient for the game. :(  New\
      \ stuff sounds fun :)\n\n'''Dma:'''  Actually some loser leaked a demo version\
      \ of the game.  I didn't know it wasn't legitimate until after I ran it and\
      \ noticed the banner at the top.\n\n'''UsAaR33''': But basically, I can put\
      \ anything I do know about the \"new features\" of UT2003, regardless of how\
      \ I got such \"information\"?\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  Well, there are ''some'' that\
      \ have legitimate means of knowing those things (and some of it is public knowledge\
      \ too).  :-)  Posting information gathered from illegally obtained software\
      \ isn't endorsed, in any case.\n\n'''UsAaR33:''' Well, if I posted something\
      \ that I don't really know, just delete it :p  And projects, er?\n\n'''Wang:'''\
      \ Just added a bunch of stuff I came across when bored\n\n'''Hugh:''' UsAaR33:\
      \ If you're not under NDA, legally, you can say anything you know about it.\
      \ However, if you're not, but you found out things using 'dodgy' methods (leaked\
      \ version, talking to someone who was under NDA), then I'd say you probably\
      \ ought not to say. If you are under NDA, then you're not allowed to say anything\
      \ which has not already been made public.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''  I've changed the\
      \ top of this page to reflect that. Hugh, feel free to change it again if it\
      \ needs it.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''  As for NDAs:  The one Epic had the people on\
      \ the [[Legacy:UT2003/Mod Summit|UT2003/Mod Summit]] sign technically disallowed\
      \ disclosure of any information obtained on the summit to anyone outside the\
      \ invited mod teams, but Tim Sweeney expressly told us at the end of the summit\
      \ that we were free to talk about it publicly, and that the NDA's main purpose\
      \ was to prevent software leaks.\n\n'''DJPaul:''' If, in theory, I knew someone\
      \ with a leaked build of UT2003, in theory, and I stole a look at the class\
      \ file, would the data gathered be postable on the Wiki or considered \"hands-off\"\
      ?  Remember, this is in theory and I don't have it, so no accusing.\n\n'''Mychaeel:'''\
      \ It would be considered hands-off.  We're not going to embrace the use of stolen\
      \ software, neither directly nor indirectly.\n\n'''Highlander:''' I have been\
      \ wondering, Due to the use of static meshes in maps, would it be better to\
      \ go for a granular / modular approch for making meshs. For example: instead\
      \ of making a large support beam (one of those made from cylinders if you know\
      \ what i mean) make the cylinders as meshes and simply use them to make the\
      \ support beam in unrealed(scaled & rotated etc etc...). I realise the memory\
      \ footprint of lotsa identical smaller meshes would be less (i think). But would\
      \ there be a performance hit in fps from having to render \"more\" objects?\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' Well... using many different low-poly meshes is worse for\
      \ performance than using a single high-poly one many times, I believe.  As for\
      \ modularity, settle for what makes sense:  That would be (in my opinion, in\
      \ most cases) neither building an entire map as a static mesh nor making 3D\
      \ primitives to be combined in UnrealEd but, in your example, building that\
      \ support beam as a single static mesh.\n\n'''Highlander:''' Another question\
      \ would be what is happening with collision in ut2k3? is it still cylinders?\
      \ or can we create arbitary shapes for collision? (do we even still have the\
      \ option of cylinders?) \n\n'''Mychaeel:''' See [[Legacy:Hardware Brush|Hardware\
      \ Brush]].  (Collision cylinders are only for actors, and static meshes aren't\
      \ technically related to Unreal Tournament's [[Legacy:Decoration|Decoration]]\
      \ meshes anymore.)\n\n----\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''  So how are we going to handle\
      \ UT2003 stuff then?  Has a decision been made yet.  From all accounts (and\
      \ this is all based upon rumor, speculation, and the odd fact here and there)\
      \ the class hierarchy for UT2003 is pretty different to that of UT.  It also\
      \ sounds like a lot of the classes have tweaked (or changed) functionality as\
      \ well.  Although it does seem like the game isn't due out any time soon now,\
      \ I think we'll wind up having to keep most of the script-type information seperate\
      \ from the UT stuff.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' This has been discussed at length in\
      \ a now lost thread in the Unreal Wiki forum.  We haven't found a conclusive\
      \ answer yet, but your input would certainly be welcome.\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \  Thanks.  I always forget about the Wiki forums.\n\n'''Luggage:''' Better\
      \ check this whole thread: [http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~polycount/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006636.html\
      \ PolyCount's Mod Summit thread]\n\n'''Tarquin:''' quote from that thread: \"\
      as well as a bunch of non-descript europeans or something\" !!!\n\n'''Githianki:'''\
      \ I've added some info I confirmed about the particle systems.  Someone should\
      \ go through here (who can do a complete list) and re-factor and clean out obviously\
      \ old comments.\n\nAS for the mesh questions, recall that each mesh has an overhead\
      \ so the overall number of dicreet and distinct meshes is what impacts performance\
      \ (along with tex obviously) not necessarily the number of instances of any\
      \ one of those meshes or the number of polys in one of those meshes.  That said\
      \ lots of instances of a huge variety of of high poly meshes will have a big\
      \ performance impact over a few instances, of a few, low poly meshes.  The least\
      \ important factor is the poly count of a mesh since the poly numbers that can\
      \ be thrown around are enormous.\n\n'''GRAFIK:''' Seen as how UT2003 differs\
      \ little in terms of engine features, instead of having seperate [[Legacy:New\
      \ Features In UT2004|New Features in UT2004]] as linked to on the Home Page,\
      \ shouldn't there be a [[Legacy:New Features In UT200X|New Features in UT200X]]?\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' Since the 2004 page doesn't exist, yup. Might as well rename\
      \ this one to 200x and link all the more spcific new feature lists from here.\n\
      \n'''GRAFIK:''' Done. :)\n:[Edit: Updated pages linked to at top of page as\
      \ well.]\n\n'''LionsPhil:''' Would it be worth having a section on \"broken/removed\
      \ features in UT200X\", like warp zones, mirrors, and even vaguely advanced\
      \ dynamic lighting (no, projectors do not replace that as they don't actually\
      \ cast light, and \"casting shadow\" is an unnecessarily complex ugly kludge;\
      \ bDynamic doesn't work for animation effects like rotation)? I don't mean a\
      \ whole new node, but just another heading on this one.\n\n'''Evilmrfran:'''\
      \ There is one big difference in the old and new editors.  The Unreal Ed 2.0\
      \ had an option called \"create new path network\"  As far as I know UT2k3/UT2k4\
      \ doesn't have this option.  I miss being lazy -_- lol\n\n[[Category:Legacy\
