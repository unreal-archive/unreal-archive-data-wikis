      \ including ActorX. It's a limitation of the license. If you're using Maya PLE\

      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>When importing a static mesh into UnrealEd, it doesn't look\
      \ anything like the mesh I designed in Maya and/or parts of the mesh are in\
      \ the wrong place relative to each other&#160;</dt>\n<dd>It seems that the importer\
      \ doesn't work properly unless you select all the objects making up the static\
      \ mesh and then select Modify -&gt; Freeze Transformations first.<br />\n<br\
      \ />\n<b>Fat Marrow:</b> I also select Edit -&gt; Delete by Type -&gt; History\
      \ first, but this may not be required.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Some parts of\
      \ the mesh don't appear in UnrealEd&#160;</dt>\n<dd>It seems that objects created\
      \ using the normal Edit -&gt; Duplicate function (created either as copies or\
      \ instances) don't seem to import into UnrealEd. Using the Edit -&gt; Duplicate\
      \ with Transform function does seem to work, however (subject to the point above\
      \ regarding freezing transformations before importing).</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n\
      <dt>I've added the package, group and scale attributes to the set which I've\
      \ created, but both the scale and group attributes seem to be ignored&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd><b>Fat Marrow:</b> I don't know the solution, but it is worth noting that\
      \ the package attribute at least seems to be case sensitive (must be lower case).</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>I double-click a material I've created, and I've added the\
      \ URMaterialName attribute to it, but the texture doesn't seem to get set when\
      \ I import&#160;</dt>\n<dd>You have to add the URMaterialName attribute to the\
      \ material shading group, which is distinct from the material you created (its\
      \ default name ends with an 'SG' suffix). One way to select the shading group\
      \ is to go to the hypershade window, select your material, right-click it and\
      \ select 'Graph selected' (or something like that), then select the material\
      \ again in the lower window and click the button in one of the hypershade menu\
      \ bars which looks like a square with arrows going in and out of it ('show upstream\
      \ and downstream connections'). You should then see your shading group appear\
      \ to the RHS of your material. Then double-click this, and then add the URMaterialName\
      \ attribute.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Fat Marrow:</b> This seems unduly convoluted,\
      \ but I've found no other/better way to do this.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>I've\
      \ set up my URMaterialName attributes properly for my shading groups (see above),\
      \ but when I import my model, parts of it are covered in a blank concrete texture&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>You have to manually load all of the referenced texture packs before you\
      \ import your model. But also check your spelling – is that Abaddon, or Abbadon?</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>I've set up my URMaterialName attributes properly <b>and</b>\
      \ I've now loaded all the necessary texture packs, but my textures still don't\
      \ import properly&#160;</dt>\n<dd>If you've had a failed import, it's often\
      \ necessary to delete that static mesh before trying again. This may seem frustrating,\
      \ but you have to keep the UnrealEd gremlin well-fed.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>When\
      \ I map 'File' textures to surfaces in Maya, they come out upside down in UnrealEd&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd><b>Fat Marrow:</b> I don't really know the solution, other than to do hacky\
      \ things like flip the textures before you import them into UnrealEd. This may\
      \ also be a Targa-specific problem; saving textures as (say) .bmp may work better.</dd>\n\
      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>I get strange artifacts when I import meshes into UnrealEd&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>It seems that the importer doesn't always work well when converting quad\
      \ polygons to triangles; you are better off converting your meshes before importing\
      \ (Polygons -&gt; Triangulate).<br />\n<br />\n<b>Fat Marrow:</b> In other situations,\
      \ for some reason when extruding faces in certain ways, I get strange artifacts\
      \ which can't be cured.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>When I type 'unEditor mesh &lt;name&gt;'\
      \ in the script box, nothing happens – not even an error&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Sometimes\
      \ the Maya / UnrealEd interface seems to get borked and cause this – restarting\
      \ both seems to fix it sometimes. At other times, nothing at all seems to fix\
      \ it – I think this happens when the objects have been mangled in some strange\
      \ noob-like way. For this reason, I recommend saving multiple versions of the\
      \ Maya PLE file and regularly doing a test import (if you just make a quick\
      \ set and don't bother setting any of the necessary attributes, you will create\
      \ a mesh in the MyPackage package, in the MyPackageN group – where N increases\
      \ each time you export the same set name).</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>When I import\
      \ an object, there are more materials associated with it than I had expected&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>You need to combine all your polygons before importing – Polygons -&gt;\
      \ Combine (and then make sure that your combined polygon is the only member\
      \ of your set), or else the importer creates at least one material per object.<br\
      \ />\n<br />\n<b>Fat Marrow:</b> I still get spurious extra materials appearing\
      \ sometimes in the static mesh browser</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>When I import\
      \ an object, all the edges get smoothed, even edges that didn't even originally\
      \ share vertices (but the endpoints were at the same place).&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Is\
      \ this just a limitation of the unEditor plugin?</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>Chip:</b>\
      \ This is a plug-in limitation.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>When I try to load the unEditor.mll\
      \ plugin shipped with PLE I get the error \"The plug-in could not be loaded.\
      \ The Personal Learning Edition of Maya can only load plug-ins that are built\
      \ specifically for the Personal Learning Edition...\"&#160;</dt>\n<dd>(originally\
      \ discovered on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Maya/Discuss\" title=\"Legacy:Maya/Discuss\"\
      >Maya/Discuss</a> page) To fix this, hold the windows key hit type F15 (Pause).\
      \ Click the Advanced tab and then the Environment Variables button. Find the\
      \ PATH environment variable and hit the Edit button. After \"C:\\Program Files\\\
      AliasWavefront\\Maya 4 Personal Learning Edition\\bin;\" and before any system\
      \ paths, add the following:\"C:\\UT2003\\System;c:\\UT2003;\". Quit and re-open\
      \ Maya and it should not start UnrealEd when you load the plugin.</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <p><b>GRAF!K:</b> Interesting error message for that problem.&#160;:-/</p>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>All or part of my model appears inside-out when I import it, and/or\
      \ I can walk and shoot through it&#160;</dt>\n<dd>This may be because the face\
      \ normals are wrong or reversed. Select the relevant faces (or the entire model)\
      \ and select Edit Polygons -&gt; Normals -&gt; Reverse (I don't know what the\
      \ options do) or try other commands in the Normals submenu (Set Normals to Face\
      \ [or something like that] seems appropriate).</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><b>enDLine.SPA:</b>\
      \ If you reverse the normals (to make say a cave or inside out structure) make\
      \ sure to turn on backface culling (Shading-&gt;back face culling) and when\
      \ you import the mesh in ued and get it all set up where you want it make sure\
      \ to turn <b><i>off</i></b> simple collision.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>When I import a\
      \ model, it looks fine but I can walk and shoot through it&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Sometimes\
      \ extruding faces (usually many at a time) can cause non-obvious 'bugs' in the\
      \ model, which look ok but mess up the collision side of things. You can sometimes\
      \ identify areas of concern by doing a Polygon -&gt; Cleanup (with pretty much\
      \ all options ticked), and seeing which parts collapse (then undo the cleanup\
      \ and start reworking those parts of the model). However, in general, it seems\
      \ best to use face extrusions sparingly (from a noob perspective, anyway) –\
      \ edge extrusions may generally cause fewer problems, however.</dd>\n</dl>\n\
      <dl>\n<dt>When I look at my model in Maya, the lighting is strange in places&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>This is most commonly caused by non-planar polygons (e.g. you've moved one\
      \ point of a quadrilateral out of the plane of the other three points), which\
      \ there is no obviously correct way to light/draw. It's probably best to fix\
      \ these as they occur by using the Split Polygon tool to split up the polygon\
      \ in question until only planar polygons remain. The importer will probably\
      \ do this in any event, but possibly not without bugs. A further source of strange\
      \ lighting is if you play around with the orientation of the face normals. I\
      \ think (but I am not sure) that Edit Polygons -&gt; Normals -&gt; Set Normal\
      \ to Face [or something like that] usually fixes this.</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>How\
      \ do I get cool rendered shadows and lights on my model, like the UT2k3 industrial\
      \ static meshes have?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>There is an option in Maya to 'bake' shadows\
      \ and lighting onto models, but it doesn't seem possible in the PLE version\
      \ without getting a watermark (i.e. give up). As far as I worked out, it seems\
      \ to involve selecting the object you want to 'bake', shift-selecting the relevant\
      \ shading group / material, and then selecting a menu option in the hypershade\
      \ window which is something like 'Convert to File Texture'.<br />\n<br />\n\
      <b>Fat Marrow:</b> Anyone else know any different? I'd love to be able to do\
      \ this in the PLE version...</dd>\n</dl>\n<dl>\n<dt>Isn't there a quicker way\
      \ to set up the sets for exporting with unEditor?&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Yes, by installing\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:PerformCreateUTSet.Mel\" title=\"Legacy:PerformCreateUTSet.Mel\"\
      >performCreateUTSet.mel</a> into your local scripts directory (see help files\
      \ for details), you can create a shelf button that pops up a window to let you\
      \ create the set by filling in some fields and clicking a button.</dd>\n</dl>\n\

      \ what the Scale value. : There are two versions of the [[Legacy:UnEditor.Mll|unEditor.mll]]\
      \ plug-in. The one dated 10/28/03 erroneously ignores the Scale property. Try\
      \ the earlier version from the link below if you have this problem.\n\nhttp://wiki.beyondunreal.com/dl.php/wiki/patches/UnEditor091802.zip\n\
      \n; I have ActorX in the plug-ins directory, but I can't get it to work with\
      \ Maya PLE. Why not? : Maya PLE cannot use most plug-ins, including ActorX.\
      \ It's a limitation of the license. If you're using Maya PLE v.4.0.1 that shipped\
      \ with UT2003, you can use the [[Legacy:UnEditor.Mll|unEditor.mll]] plug-in\
      \ for exporting to UEd3. \n\n; When importing a static mesh into UnrealEd, it\
      \ doesn't look anything like the mesh I designed in Maya and/or parts of the\
      \ mesh are in the wrong place relative to each other : It seems that the importer\
      \ doesn't work properly unless you select all the objects making up the static\
      \ mesh and then select Modify -> Freeze Transformations first.<br /><br />'''Fat\
      \ Marrow:''' I also select Edit -> Delete by Type -> History first, but this\
      \ may not be required. \n\n; Some parts of the mesh don't appear in UnrealEd\
      \ : It seems that objects created using the normal Edit -> Duplicate function\
      \ (created either as copies or instances) don't seem to import into UnrealEd.\
      \ Using the Edit -> Duplicate with Transform function does seem to work, however\
      \ (subject to the point above regarding freezing transformations before importing).\n\
      \n; I've added the package, group and scale attributes to the set which I've\
      \ created, but both the scale and group attributes seem to be ignored : '''Fat\
      \ Marrow:''' I don't know the solution, but it is worth noting that the package\
      \ attribute at least seems to be case sensitive (must be lower case).\n\n; I\
      \ double-click a material I've created, and I've added the URMaterialName attribute\
      \ to it, but the texture doesn't seem to get set when I import : You have to\
      \ add the URMaterialName attribute to the material shading group, which is distinct\
      \ from the material you created (its default name ends with an 'SG' suffix).\
      \ One way to select the shading group is to go to the hypershade window, select\
      \ your material, right-click it and select 'Graph selected' (or something like\
      \ that), then select the material again in the lower window and click the button\
      \ in one of the hypershade menu bars which looks like a square with arrows going\
      \ in and out of it ('show upstream and downstream connections'). You should\
      \ then see your shading group appear to the RHS of your material. Then double-click\
      \ this, and then add the URMaterialName attribute.<br /><br />'''Fat Marrow:'''\
      \ This seems unduly convoluted, but I've found no other/better way to do this.\n\
      \n; I've set up my URMaterialName attributes properly for my shading groups\
      \ (see above), but when I import my model, parts of it are covered in a blank\
      \ concrete texture : You have to manually load all of the referenced texture\
      \ packs before you import your model. But also check your spelling &ndash; is\
      \ that Abaddon, or Abbadon? \n\n; I've set up my URMaterialName attributes properly\
      \ '''and''' I've now loaded all the necessary texture packs, but my textures\
      \ still don't import properly : If you've had a failed import, it's often necessary\
      \ to delete that static mesh before trying again. This may seem frustrating,\
      \ but you have to keep the UnrealEd gremlin well-fed.\n\n; When I map 'File'\
      \ textures to surfaces in Maya, they come out upside down in UnrealEd : '''Fat\
      \ Marrow:''' I don't really know the solution, other than to do hacky things\
      \ like flip the textures before you import them into UnrealEd. This may also\
      \ be a Targa-specific problem; saving textures as (say) .bmp may work better.\n\
      \n; I get strange artifacts when I import meshes into UnrealEd : It seems that\
      \ the importer doesn't always work well when converting quad polygons to triangles;\
      \ you are better off converting your meshes before importing (Polygons -> Triangulate).<br\
      \ /><br />'''Fat Marrow:''' In other situations, for some reason when extruding\
      \ faces in certain ways, I get strange artifacts which can't be cured.\n\n;\
      \ When I type 'unEditor mesh <name>' in the script box, nothing happens &ndash;\
      \ not even an error : Sometimes the Maya / UnrealEd interface seems to get borked\
      \ and cause this &ndash; restarting both seems to fix it sometimes. At other\
      \ times, nothing at all seems to fix it &ndash; I think this happens when the\
      \ objects have been mangled in some strange noob-like way. For this reason,\
      \ I recommend saving multiple versions of the Maya PLE file and regularly doing\
      \ a test import (if you just make a quick set and don't bother setting any of\
      \ the necessary attributes, you will create a mesh in the MyPackage package,\
      \ in the MyPackageN group &ndash; where N increases each time you export the\
      \ same set name).\n\n; When I import an object, there are more materials associated\
      \ with it than I had expected : You need to combine all your polygons before\
      \ importing &ndash; Polygons -> Combine (and then make sure that your combined\
      \ polygon is the only member of your set), or else the importer creates at least\
      \ one material per object.<br /><br />'''Fat Marrow:''' I still get spurious\
      \ extra materials appearing sometimes in the static mesh browser\n\n; When I\
      \ import an object, all the edges get smoothed, even edges that didn't even\
      \ originally share vertices (but the endpoints were at the same place). : Is\
      \ this just a limitation of the unEditor plugin?\n\n'''Chip:''' This is a plug-in\
      \ limitation.\n\n; When I try to load the unEditor.mll plugin shipped with PLE\
      \ I get the error \"The plug-in could not be loaded.  The Personal Learning\
      \ Edition of Maya can only load plug-ins that are built specifically for the\
      \ Personal Learning Edition...\" : (originally discovered on the [[Legacy:Maya/Discuss|Maya/Discuss]]\
      \ page) To fix this, hold the windows key hit type F15 (Pause).  Click the Advanced\
      \ tab and then the Environment Variables button.  Find the PATH environment\
      \ variable and hit the Edit button.  After \"C:\\Program Files\\AliasWavefront\\\
      Maya 4 Personal Learning Edition\\bin;\" and before any system paths, add the\
      \ following:\"C:\\UT2003\\System;c:\\UT2003;\".  Quit and re-open Maya and it\
      \ should not start UnrealEd when you load the plugin.\n\n'''GRAF!K:''' Interesting\
      \ error message for that problem. :-/\n\n; All or part of my model appears inside-out\
      \ when I import it, and/or I can walk and shoot through it : This may be because\
      \ the face normals are wrong or reversed. Select the relevant faces (or the\
      \ entire model) and select Edit Polygons -> Normals -> Reverse (I don't know\
      \ what the options do) or try other commands in the Normals submenu (Set Normals\
      \ to Face [or something like that] seems appropriate).\n\n'''enDLine.SPA:'''\
      \ If you reverse the normals (to make say a cave or inside out structure) make\
      \ sure to turn on backface culling (Shading->back face culling) and when you\
      \ import the mesh in ued and get it all set up where you want it make sure to\
      \ turn <b><i>off</i></b> simple collision. \n\n; When I import a model, it looks\
      \ fine but I can walk and shoot through it : Sometimes extruding faces (usually\
      \ many at a time) can cause non-obvious 'bugs' in the model, which look ok but\
      \ mess up the collision side of things. You can sometimes identify areas of\
      \ concern by doing a Polygon -> Cleanup (with pretty much all options ticked),\
      \ and seeing which parts collapse (then undo the cleanup and start reworking\
      \ those parts of the model). However, in general, it seems best to use face\
      \ extrusions sparingly (from a noob perspective, anyway) &ndash; edge extrusions\
      \ may generally cause fewer problems, however.\n\n; When I look at my model\
      \ in Maya, the lighting is strange in places : This is most commonly caused\
      \ by non-planar polygons (e.g. you've moved one point of a quadrilateral out\
      \ of the plane of the other three points), which there is no obviously correct\
      \ way to light/draw. It's probably best to fix these as they occur by using\
      \ the Split Polygon tool to split up the polygon in question until only planar\
      \ polygons remain. The importer will probably do this in any event, but possibly\
      \ not without bugs. A further source of strange lighting is if you play around\
      \ with the orientation of the face normals. I think (but I am not sure) that\
      \ Edit Polygons -> Normals -> Set Normal to Face [or something like that] usually\
      \ fixes this.\n\n; How do I get cool rendered shadows and lights on my model,\
      \ like the UT2k3 industrial static meshes have? : There is an option in Maya\
      \ to 'bake' shadows and lighting onto models, but it doesn't seem possible in\
      \ the PLE version without getting a watermark (i.e. give up). As far as I worked\
      \ out, it seems to involve selecting the object you want to 'bake', shift-selecting\
      \ the relevant shading group / material, and then selecting a menu option in\
      \ the hypershade window which is something like 'Convert to File Texture'.<br\
      \ /><br />'''Fat Marrow:''' Anyone else know any different? I'd love to be able\
      \ to do this in the PLE version...\n\n; Isn't there a quicker way to set up\
      \ the sets for exporting with unEditor? : Yes, by installing [[Legacy:PerformCreateUTSet.Mel|performCreateUTSet.mel]]\
      \ into your local scripts directory (see help files for details), you can create\
      \ a shelf button that pops up a window to let you create the set by filling\
      \ in some fields and clicking a button.\n\n; I use maya6 ple edition, how do\
      \ i get the things i made with it into unreal editor?\n\n==See also==\n\n[[Legacy:Static\
      \ Mesh Modeling|Static mesh modeling]]\n\n----\n\n==Discussion==\n\n'''Fat Marrow:'''\
      \ This is beginning to need more structure, but I can't think of any obvious\
      \ subheadings\n\n'''Ben2500:''' Are there any downloads for Maya that will make\
      \ it work on a computer running ME.\n\n'''Dirk Fist:''' There is a bug in my\
      \ video card/driver( and/or UED-3 ?) which prevents UED from running if any\
      \ other program is using the 3D hardware. For this reason I could'nt export\
      \ using maya 4, but the new maya 5 exporter (comes with 2k4) can connect to\
      \ a running copy of UED-3. Just thought I would share this info for people with\
      \ similarly inadequate video cards ;)  \n\n'''Zugy:''' [http://www.alias.com/eng/products-services/maya/maya_ple/\
