      \ page needs work.</p>\n<p>If you're uncertain about anything, or have any questions\

      <p>Not all red link pages should be immediately created. Before creating a new\

      \ When new pages are created, editors will often make sure to place all the\
      \ necessary links <i>from</i> the page, but it can be much less convenient to\
      \ track down all the other pages that should link to their new page. While looking\
      \ over a page, click on the \"What Links Here\" button (in the toolbox at the\
      \ bottom of the left-hand side of the page), and see whether the list of \"\
      What Links Here\" pages seems comparable in length to the number of links on\

  wikitext:
    text: "There are many ways to '''help the wiki'''. Our goal is to document [[UnrealEd]]\
      \ and all technical aspects of the [[Unreal Engine]] relevant to creating maps\
      \ and mods for Unreal Engine games, as well as writing [[:Category:Tutorials|tutorials]]\
      \ on how to achieve various goals with UnrealEd and the Unreal Engine. Anyone\
      \ who would like to help is welcome to contribute.\n\nThe Unreal Wiki does not\
      \ seek to document the player's view of Unreal games or any information related\
      \ to server administration. These are the goals of [[liandri:|Liandri Archives]]\
      \ and the [[uadmin:|Unreal Admin Wiki]] respectively, which are separate projects\
      \ not directly related to UnrealWiki. However, we encourage our visitors and\
      \ contributors to help those two projects as well and to create cross-links\
      \ between them where it makes sense.\n\nEditors are free to work on any project\
      \ that they find interesting.  If you're reading a page and see something that\
      \ needs to be fixed, just click on the [[Help:Editing pages|\"edit\"]] button\
      \ and fix it.  If you're looking for something that needs to be done, this page\
      \ provides some suggestions.\n\n==General page improvement==\nThe ideas in this\
      \ section can be applied to almost any page on the site; while you are reading\
      \ articles, keep in mind whether any of these improvements are needed on the\
      \ page.  In addition, there are various [[:Category:Helping out|categories]]\
      \ and [[Special:specialpages|special pages]] where articles that have been tagged\
      \ as needing improvements are listed.  You can browse through any of those categories\
      \ and see if any of the pages are on topics that you're knowledgeable about.\
      \  Or you can add any page that you think needs maintenance to a category to\
      \ let other editors know that page needs work.\n\nIf you're uncertain about\
      \ anything, or have any questions you'd like answered before jumping in and\
      \ starting to edit, feel free to ask!  You can post any questions you might\
      \ have on this article's [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|talk page]] or any other relevant\
      \ talk page on the site, and an editor will try to help out.\n\n===Create new\
      \ articles===\nAre we missing something? If there are a lot of pages that link\
      \ to an empty page, you may want to [[Help:Starting a new page|create it]].\
      \ [[Help:Links|Links]] in blue represent pages that have been created, and links\
      \ in red represent pages that have not been created. If an editor creates a\
      \ red link, it is an indication that he believes an article should be created\
      \ at the target location.\n\nNot all red link pages should be immediately created.\
      \  Before creating a new page at the target location you should:\n* First check\
      \ whether a page discussing that topic already exists. If so, fix all of the\
      \ links and make them point to the correct page instead.\n* Only create a new\
      \ page if you can fill in more than a single sentence. New pages should try\
      \ to provide a complete discussion of the page's topic. If you don't know enough\
      \ to fill in more than one sentence, it is better to leave the page as a red\
      \ link. Then other editors can more easily identify which pages need work.\n\
      If you believe there should be an article on the other end of a link and you\
      \ have some good ideas about what to put there, then by all means start writing\
      \ it!\n* [[Special:Wantedpages|Wanted pages]] provides a list of all the pages\
      \ that exist as \"red links\".  Click on the page name to create it; click on\
      \ the \"# links\" link to see what pages have the links and fix those pages\
      \ if more appropriate.\n\n===Expanding articles===\nMany articles can be expanded\
      \ and improved upon. You could roam the site looking for articles that you feel\
      \ are too vague, then elaborate on them. You could also expand upon [[Project:Stub|stub\
      \ pages]], which are articles that have not received substantial attention from\
      \ other editors and do not have a sufficient amount of information.\n* [[:Category:Stubs]]\
      \ provides a list of minimal length articles that need to be fleshed out.\n\n\
      ===Cleaning up articles===\nThere are (unfortunately) always articles that do\
      \ not meet the site's [[Project:Style guide|style guidelines]].  Some common\
      \ problems with articles include:\n* Incorrect spelling or grammar.\n* Use of\
      \ [[Project:Style guide#No first person|first person]] perspective.\n* Pages\
      \ that do not include proper wiki [[Help:Formatting|formatting]].\nPages that\
      \ have been identified as needing to be cleaned up are listed at:\n* [[:Category:Pages\
      \ needing cleanup]]: any type of general cleanup; typically the known problems\
      \ are listed on the article or on its talk page.\n* [[:Category:Pages needing\
      \ wikification]]: pages that need wiki formatting; often these pages will also\
      \ need to have [[#Adding Links|links added]].\n\n===Adding suggestions===\n\
      If you believe any article needs improvements or fixes, but you don't know how\
      \ to do it yourself, then post a message on the article's talk page.  For example,\
      \ if you don't understand anything on this article or think that there is missing\
      \ information, just edit [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|the talk page]] (also accessible\
      \ on any page by clicking the link that says \"discussion\") and type in your\
      \ suggestions.  Suggestions on how to make it easier to find information or\
      \ pointers about basic information that has been overlooked is particularly\
      \ welcome: the more experienced editors who add a lot of the wiki's content\
      \ have a hard time remembering what it was like as a new editor ;)\n\n===Adding\
      \ links===\nMany necessary [[Help:Links|links]] between wiki pages are missing,\
      \ which makes it harder for readers to find information.  If you are reading\
      \ a page and realize that it contains few or no links, add some (but [[Project:Style\
      \ guide#Avoid cluttering links|don't go overboard]]).\n\nAn even more prevalent\
      \ problem with wiki pages is that links ''to'' the page are often missing. \
      \ When new pages are created, editors will often make sure to place all the\
      \ necessary links ''from'' the page, but it can be much less convenient to track\
      \ down all the other pages that should link to their new page.  While looking\
      \ over a page, click on the \"What Links Here\" button (in the toolbox at the\
      \ bottom of the left-hand side of the page), and see whether the list of \"\
      What Links Here\" pages seems comparable in length to the number of links on\
      \ the page.  If you only see two or three pages in \"What Links Here\", check\
      \ whether any of the linked-to pages could be improved with a new link or two.\n\
      \n* [[Special:Lonelypages|Orphaned pages]]: pages that are not linked to by\
      \ any other wiki pages.  In general, other pages should be edited to add links\
      \ to these pages (although there are exceptions, i.e., permanently orphaned\
      \ pages that do not need to be fixed).\n* [[:Category:Pages needing wikification]]:\
      \ pages in general need of wiki formatting, which often includes adding links.\n\
      \n===Adding images===\nThere are many screenshots, maps, and other images that\
      \ would help to make articles more informative.  [[Help:Images]] provides information\
      \ on image formats and how to obtain good quality screenshots.\n* [[:Category:Pages\
      \ needing images]] lists pages that have been identified as needing an image.\n\
      \n===Other maintenance===\nOther categories and special pages that list pages\
      \ needing maintenance include:\n* [[:Category:Pages needing peer review]]: discussions\
      \ where an editor would like input from the rest of the community.\n* [[:Category:Pages\
      \ needing verification]]: pages that include facts that have not yet been confirmed\n\
      * [[Special:BrokenRedirects|Broken redirects]]: Redirect pages that link to\
      \ non-existent pages (often they need to be [[Help:Deleting  a page#Deletion\
      \ itself|proposed for deletion]]).\n* [[Special:DoubleRedirects|Double redirects]]:\
      \ Redirect pages that link to another redirect page.  The redirect needs to\
      \ be edited to point to a real wiki page.\n* [[Special:Wantedcategories|Wanted\
      \ categories]]: [[Project:Categories|Categories]] that have had pages added\
      \ to them, but the container page has not been created.\n\n==Helping the community==\n\
      ===Monitoring articles===\nUnfortunately, many people who do not understand\
      \ our goals come through here and make careless edits or edits that otherwise\
      \ do not comply with the [[Project:Style guide|style guide]]; [[Project:Vandalism|vandalism]]\
      \ occasionally happens.  These edits are caught and fixed by editors who monitor\
      \ the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]].  While there are some [[Project:Administrators#Patrollers|patrollers]]\
      \ who are given a couple of special tools to help monitor recent changes, any\
      \ editors are welcome to help out. Sometimes this means rewording a new contribution\
      \ to a page, and sometimes this means [[Help:Deleting a page|deleting]] it.\n\
      \nIf you find that you enjoy monitoring the recent changes page and tend to\
      \ be frequently checking it, you may wish to nominate yourself to join the site's\
      \ [[Project:Administrators#Patrollers|patrollers]].\n\n===Answering questions===\n\
      There are frequently questions that get asked by other contributors on article\
      \ talk pages.  If you know the answer (or even a partial answer) to any question,\
      \ feel free to answer it.  Recent questions can be identified from the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent\
      \ changes]] page; older questions can be found by checking the talk pages of\
      \ articles that you are reading.\n\n===Helping other users===\nMany users don't\
      \ know some of the ways they can help on the wiki. You could help them out by\
      \ sharing with them some of your knowledge, and encouraging them to get active\
      \ and find something to start editing. A good way is to look at the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent\
      \ changes]] page and to look for newcomers or anonymous editors who have been\
      \ making some good edits. Encourage them to get a new account if they haven't,\
      \ and show them around the community.\n\n===Public relations===\nWe need more\
      \ people that are interested in reading what we write about, and we need more\
      \ people that are interested in writing. The {{SITENAME}} does not advertise\
      \ formally, so it requires people like you to spread the word to make this site\
      \ bigger and better. Don't resort to spamming, because it makes us look bad\
      \ and makes people unhappy, but just keep an eye out for people that may be\
      \ interested. You could put a link to us in your signature on the [http://forums.epicgames.com/\
      \ official forums], for example, or you could show people who need help some\
      \ of our articles.\n\n==Projects==\nThe [[Project:Task list|task list]] provides\
      \ a list of projects that other editors have identified as needing to be done.\
      \  Everyone is invited to look through the list and add new projects or find\
      \ projects that they would like to work on.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Project:Getting\
      \ started]] - A guide for new editors\n* [[Project:Style guide]] - General guidelines\
      \ for how to write, format, and present pages.\n* [[Project:Policies and guidelines]]\
