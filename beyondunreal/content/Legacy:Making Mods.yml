      <dt>Mutator&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Mutators are one way of making a mod activatable\
      \ for the user. A mutator usually is a small modification to only one or few\
      \ rules of a game, but there are exceptions to this rule. Mutators are usually\
      \ made with the intent for it to be compatible and/or usable with other mutators,\
      \ most game types, or even multiple game types or total conversions. A mutator\
      \ has rules governing how it should behave, how it should interact, and how\
      \ much it should change within a game. See <a href=\"/Legacy:Mutator_Topics\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Mutator Topics\">Mutator Topics</a>.</dd>\n<dt>Gametype&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>Gametypes are another way to make a mod user-selectable. Each gametype has\
      \ a different objective. The gametype of CTF is <i>Capture The Flag</i>. The\
      \ goal is to find and return the enemy flag to your base. Included with UT2K3\
      \ is also the gametypes of BR (Bombing Run), DM (Deathmatch), TDM (Team Deathmatch),\
      \ and DOM (Domination). Each gametype has a different way to end or win a map.</dd>\n\
      <dt>Total conversion (TC)&#160;</dt>\n<dd>A total conversion is a collection\
      \ of gametypes with a common theme and purpose. For a total conversion it is\
      \ generally accepted that new menus will be present, new graphics will be used\
      \ throughout the entire game, a new set of INI files will be used, and that\
      \ little, if any, content from the original game will be present or used.</dd>\n\
      <dt>Server add-on&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Server add-ons don't change any part of the\
      \ game's rules. Usually they add additional features for remote administration,\
      \ security, player stats, etc. Server add-ons are often activated by adding\
      \ an entry to the ServerActors list (INI section [Engine.GameEngine]), but there\
      \ are also other ways, like changing the AccessControlClass (INI section [Engine.GameInfo])\
      \ or adding <a href=\"/Legacy:WebApplication\" title=\"Legacy:WebApplication\"\
      >WebApplications</a> to [UWeb.WebServer].</dd>\n<dt>Client add-on&#160;</dt>\n\
      <dd>In UT's UWindow system it was possible to use some client-side add ons like\
      \ GUI skins or other game menu modifications like the Mod Menu Extension or\
      \ [osX] Background Changer. These not change any part of the gameplay, but only\
      \ help players like their favorite game's menu system.&#160;;) Client-side add-ons\
      \ aren't possible in UT2003 anymore. (At least not at this time.)</dd>\n<dt>New\
      \ content&#160;</dt>\n<dd>Maps, voice packs, announcer packs, player models\
      \ or skins and similar content additions could also be viewed as mods since\
      \ they modify and extend the game.</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><br />\nNote that the term\
      \ \"mod\" does not appear in this list, because it only is a general term for\
      \ all kinds of modifications to the game. Players often distinguish between\
      \ \"mod\" and \"mutator\" eventhough they are actually only refering to different\
      \ mutators.</p>\n<p>Here on UnrealWiki we try to keep the term \"mod\" for the\
      \ general concept of a modification to the game. A \"mutator\" is anything that\
      \ can be added through the mutators list, while a \"gametype\" is anything that\
      \ is activated through the game type list. There are mutators and gametypes\
      \ that come with the game and there are custom mutators and gametypes – the\
      \ former are stock content while the latter are \"mods\", no matter how much\
      \ they actually do.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      <p><b>SuperApe:</b> This page deserves to be linked from the Home Page. Is this\

      \ and all this wiki gives on making mods is opinion/experience. it doesnt tell\
      \ you where to began if you actualy want to start making one. like in SOURCE\
      \ engine, they tell you that you must first get a base by copying some of the\
      \ codes and then you start editing the menus and create a map and such. now\
      \ for me a newb, im not sure where to start. do i just make maps and replace\
      \ some models and edit the scripts? how would i make menus and where do put\
      \ my content source? i guess im talking more on a TC mod which i believe requires\
      \ more than what is provided here... thanks for reading</p>\n<p><b>Ambershee:</b>\
      \ There are loads of tutorials on the wiki. Look at the sections Mapping Lessons\

      \ my content away from unreals content. how to go about? is that what packages\
      \ are for? it would be nice if there was a guide for making a SP mod that includes\

      \ Well hello. I will tell you that your mod will never work or even get of the\
      \ ground, if you dont know how to script. No matter how good your design or\
      \ artist you are, whatever great ideas you have, they will never get of the\
      \ ground or come to fruition until you learn to script (or posses scripting\
      \ ability through another person) which is basically programming. I realize\
      \ my low inspiration was due to this fact (and real life issues lol), I always\
      \ though i could become a scripter later on and can work on the art first, but\
      \ now i realize it is unhealthy... 1/5/08, Now iv tested all parts of developing\
      \ games and i know what i CAN and cannot do. I can make any games i want&#160;:),\
      \ thanks to the great flexible unreal engine 3... I just hope the NWO and other\
      \ bad people dont start enslaving humans before my game is complete. After my\
      \ game is complete i have no worry</p>\n<p><b>computergod666:</b> Anyone know\
      \ if it is possible to do a singleplayer mod for UT, and how?</p>\n<p><b>Raven:</b>\
      \ It is possible to make a single player mod. It is just a gametype, but the\
      \ rules are explicitly setup to focus on the single player aspects. There are\

  wikitext:
    text: "There seems to be lots of confusion as to what the difference between a\
      \ mutator, mod, gametype, or total conversion is.  You'll find that the definition\
      \ varies from person to person so the following definitions will probably not\
      \ be accepted by the whole community, but they should help mod developers. \
      \ \n  \n\n==Overview  ==\n; Mutator : Mutators are one way of making a mod activatable\
      \ for the user. A mutator usually is a small modification to only one or few\
      \ rules of a game, but there are exceptions to this rule.  Mutators are usually\
      \ made with the intent for it to be compatible and/or usable with other mutators,\
      \ most game types, or even multiple game types or total conversions.  A mutator\
      \ has rules governing how it should behave, how it should interact, and how\
      \ much it should change within a game.  See [[Legacy:Mutator Topics|Mutator\
      \ Topics]].  \n; Gametype : Gametypes are another way to make a mod user-selectable.\
      \ Each gametype has a different objective.  The gametype of CTF is ''Capture\
      \ The Flag''.  The goal is to find and return the enemy flag to your base. \
      \ Included with UT2K3 is also the gametypes of BR (Bombing Run), DM (Deathmatch),\
      \ TDM (Team Deathmatch), and DOM (Domination).  Each gametype has a different\
      \ way to end or win a map.  \n; Total conversion (TC) : A total conversion is\
      \ a collection of gametypes with a common theme and purpose.  For a total conversion\
      \ it is generally accepted that new menus will be present, new graphics will\
      \ be used throughout the entire game, a new set of INI files will be used, and\
      \ that little, if any, content from the original game will be present or used.\
      \  \n; Server add-on : Server add-ons don't change any part of the game's rules.\
      \ Usually they add additional features for remote administration, security,\
      \ player stats, etc. Server add-ons are often activated by adding an entry to\
      \ the ServerActors list (INI section [Engine.GameEngine]), but there are also\
      \ other ways, like changing the AccessControlClass (INI section [Engine.GameInfo])\
      \ or adding [[Legacy:WebApplication|WebApplication]]s to [UWeb.WebServer]. \
      \ \n; Client add-on : In UT's UWindow system it was possible to use some client-side\
      \ add ons like GUI skins or other game menu modifications like the Mod Menu\
      \ Extension or [osX] Background Changer. These not change any part of the gameplay,\
      \ but only help players like their favorite game's menu system. ;) Client-side\
      \ add-ons aren't possible in UT2003 anymore. (At least not at this time.)  \n\
      ; New content : Maps, voice packs, announcer packs, player models or skins and\
      \ similar content additions could also be viewed as mods since they modify and\
      \ extend the game.  \n  \n\nNote that the term \"mod\" does not appear in this\
      \ list, because it only is a general term for all kinds of modifications to\
      \ the game. Players often distinguish between \"mod\" and \"mutator\" eventhough\
      \ they are actually only refering to different mutators.  \n\nHere on UnrealWiki\
      \ we try to keep the term \"mod\" for the general concept of a modification\
      \ to the game. A \"mutator\" is anything that can be added through the mutators\
      \ list, while a \"gametype\" is anything that is activated through the game\
      \ type list. There are mutators and gametypes that come with the game and there\
      \ are custom mutators and gametypes &ndash; the former are stock content while\
      \ the latter are \"mods\", no matter how much they actually do.  \n  \n\n==The\
      \ Layman's Guide to Making Mods  ==\n\nIf you are thinking about making a mod\
      \ (for any game) and are not sure what you need to know, how to go about it,\
      \ or simply want to avoid the most obvious mistakes then read on.  The pages\
      \ linked to below contain some excellent advice, and possibly comments on stuff\
      \ that hadn't occured to you.  \n  \n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/My_Team_Your_Team]]\
      \ &ndash; Introduction and disclaimer for all those, \"what's all this my team\
      \ your team crap?\" readers.  \n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Why_Are_You_Making_A_Mod]]\
      \ &ndash; Sometimes the reason a mod fails is the reason you started it in the\
      \ first place.  \n* [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Building_a_Team]] &ndash;\

      \ work and their advice is recommended.  \n  \n* [[Legacy:Mychaeel/Mod Startups|Mychaeel/Mod\

      \ and ignored settings which often lead to lower performance &ndash; and how\

      \ to amaze me how many programmers completely fail to take advantage of the\
      \ wealth of experience of software developers that have decided to commit the\
      \ things they have learnt to paper and write a book.  Although the following\
      \ books will not help you write mods, they will help you write better software,\
      \ and possibly manage your team and project more effectively.  You don't have\
      \ to agree with what the books say &ndash; as long as you understand why you\
      \ disagree.  The books are in no particular order. (the links go to the original\

      \  ==\n\n'''SuperApe:''' This page deserves to be linked from the Home Page.\
      \  Is this a good hub for Modding? \n\n'''fleshsniper1:''' hmm.... iv looked\
      \ around and all this wiki gives on making mods is opinion/experience. it doesnt\
      \ tell you where to began if you actualy want to start making one. like in SOURCE\
      \ engine, they tell you that you must first get a base by copying some of the\
      \ codes and then you start editing the menus and create a map and such. now\
      \ for me a newb, im not sure where to start. do i just make maps and replace\
      \ some models and edit the scripts? how would i make menus and where do put\
      \ my content source? i guess im talking more on a TC mod which i believe requires\
      \ more than what is provided here... thanks for reading\n\n'''Ambershee:'''\
      \ There are loads of tutorials on the wiki. Look at the sections Mapping Lessons\
      \ and UnrealScript Lessons.\n\n'''fleshsniper1:''' right now iv done most of\
      \ the basic tutorials. i can make a crappy map and compile it with pawn actors\
      \ and such basics. but where do i began creating/importing content and maintining\
      \ my content away from unreals content. how to go about? is that what packages\
      \ are for? it would be nice if there was a guide for making a SP mod that includes\
      \ starting up a base that wont interfere with the UT2004 game, how to manage\
      \ content. somthing like that :)\n\n'''Ambershee:''' http://udn.epicgames.com/Two/MyFirstCode.html\n\
      \n'''fleshsniper1:''' Well hello. I will tell you that your mod will never work\
      \ or even get of the ground, if you dont know how to script. No matter how good\
      \ your design or artist you are, whatever great ideas you have, they will never\
      \ get of the ground or come to fruition until you learn to script (or posses\
      \ scripting ability through another person) which is basically programming.\
      \ I realize my low inspiration was due to this fact (and real life issues lol),\
      \ I always though i could become a scripter later on and can work on the art\
      \ first, but now i realize it is unhealthy... 1/5/08, Now iv tested all parts\
      \ of developing games and i know what i CAN and cannot do. I can make any games\
      \ i want :), thanks to the great flexible unreal engine 3... I just hope the\
      \ NWO and other bad people dont start enslaving humans before my game is complete.\
      \ After my game is complete i have no worry\n\n'''computergod666:''' Anyone\
      \ know if it is possible to do a singleplayer mod for UT, and how?\n\n'''Raven:'''\
      \ It is possible to make a single player mod. It is just a gametype, but the\
      \ rules are explicitly setup to focus on the single player aspects. There are\
      \ many extra issues that come up when making an exclusive single player game,\
      \ mostly to do with the shear output of art content to give the player enough\
      \ to do and see. \n\n'''computergod666:''' Thanks. So does anyone know of a\
      \ good tutorial for making SP mods?\n\n'''computergod666:''' I get the funny\
      \ feeling that no one around here is interested in single-player games!\n\n\
      '''SuperApe:''' [[Legacy:SuperApe/Old Skool Monsta Toolz|Old Skool Monsta Toolz]]\
      \ can help for UT2004.  OSM Adventure is a single-player/coop gametype and OSMT\
