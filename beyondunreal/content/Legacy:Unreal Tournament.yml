      \ 1996 there was Quake. And it was good. Nothing stood in its path, nothing\
      \ could compare to it in any way. When Epic first announced their own competitive\
      \ multiplayer FPS game building up on their inhouse Engine they had used for\
      \ their incredibly successful single player FPS Unreal, most people didn't take\
      \ them very seriously considering the giant fanbase of the Quake series.</p>\n\
      <p>UT developed by <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.digitalextremes.com\"\
      >Digital Extremes</a> was published in November 1999 by <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.gtinteractive.com/\">GT Interactive</a>\
      \ for PC and was later released for PS2, <a href=\"/Legacy:Linux\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Linux\">Linux</a>, Dreamcast and <a href=\"/Legacy:Mac\" title=\"Legacy:Mac\"\
      >Mac</a>. Quake III was published around the same time but offered little new,\
      \ whereas UT could offer multiple game modes from simple Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch,\
      \ Capture The Flag, Domination, Last Man Standing to Assault, new Movement types\
      \ (Dodging), more diverse weapons with multiple firing modes that could be combined,\
      \ intelligent Bots, it could be modded easily and and could provide one thing\
      \ most of all: FUN!!! (lots of it)</p>\n<p>UT won several game of the year awards\
      \ and a GOTY (Game Of The Year) Edition was released that contained additional\
      \ free content like maps, skins, models etc. that the developers had released\
      \ to the community before in the form of several free bonus packs. This development\
      \ philosophy to improve and enhance the product with free bonus stuff has become\
      \ characteristic of the UT series and was continued in the sequel of UT <a href=\"\
      /Legacy:UT2003\" title=\"Legacy:UT2003\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003</a> that was published in late 2002. It helped to build up the large\
      \ Unreal community that today is stronger than ever before. Since the release\
      \ of UT Quake and its successors have had to live under the ever growing shadow\
      \ of the Unreal franchise.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\"\

      <p>Read what <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://pc.ign.com/\"\
      >IGNPC</a> had to say about UT in their review 1999:</p>\n<p>Unreal Tournament\
      \ is getting the highest score that IGNPC has ever given a game. Simply put,\
      \ Epic has earned it by delivering a title that is as close to flawless as I've\
      \ ever seen, both in its ability to entertain and in its finely honed technology\
      \ and presentation. While there's no doubt that Quake III is a powerfully addictive\
      \ game with some advantages over Unreal, I feel like, in the long run, Unreal\
      \ Tournament will be the better of the two games. Still, Tal is currently working\
      \ on his Quake III review and you'll have to wait until next week to see our\
      \ head-to-head comparison of the two games. In the end though, none of this\
      \ really matters - this is a title that will keep you (and your friends) busy\
      \ for a very long time to come. Go buy it.</p>\n<p>More reviews can be found\

      \ GB free hard-disk space for all that stuff you download</p>\n<p>(for those\
      \ who haven't figured out im just kidding)</p>\n<p><b>RDGDanClark:</b> A minor\
      \ edit, I changed the release of UT2003 to \"late 2002\" &#160;:) Can you guys\
      \ believe it's almost a year old?</p>\n<p><b>Rasterbator:</b> How about a port\
      \ to OS X for UnrealEd2? I have been wanting to create maps and textures, but\
      \ really don't want to buy a Microsoft product (Virtual PC) to do it. I am running\
      \ UT GOTY edition with 436 patch, and playing on OS X with the latest Beat Preview\
      \ for OS X (no problems - runs just as well as in OS 9). Anybody know if this\
      \ is being worked on?</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I don't think there's been any\
      \ official word on this, however, I believe UnrealEd and the older builds of\
      \ the engine are essentially unsupported by Epic now. To my knowledge, porting\
      \ UCC and UnrealEd to Mac and Linux is a very low priority, but on the \"eventual\"\
      \ list. However, when they do do so, I strongly suspect it will be the latest\
      \ version of the editor that they port.</p>\n<p><b>Dark Pulse:</b> I believe\
      \ it's been said many a time that the older UnrealEd (Not sure of Version 3)\
      \ had a lot of <i>x86</i> specific code and as such porting it would be a total\
      \ pain in the ass. Of course, that's not to say someone couldn't do it... it'd\
      \ just take a lot of time, a lot of headaches, and without a Code Dump, probably\
      \ reverse-enginerring of some sort.</p>\n<p><b>Slim:</b> There are a few rumours\
      \ flying around and hitting people that suggest Epic are probably working on\
      \ (or may be going to start working on) UED for OS 10. I've no idea if this\
      \ is true or not. Probably not. Although it wouldn't surprise me if it was true\
      \ since one of the main reasons UED never got released for the original Unreal\
      \ Tournament was because of the porters of the mac version; Westlake Interactive.\
      \ And since Epic took over the Mac production (go Epic) I suspected that it\
      \ would get a lot more attention than it's predeccesor did. I've added a new\
      \ page to put in some details about the <a href=\"/Legacy:Mac\" title=\"Legacy:Mac\"\
      >Mac</a> version too if that's okay.</p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b> The new UnrealEd\
      \ (4?) that comes with the UnrealEngine3 will be platform independed. Older\
      \ versions of UnrealEd will never get a Mac (or Linux) port. The reason why\
      \ UnrealEd 2 was never ported to Mac (or Linux) was because too much of its\
      \ code base used win32 libraries (same goes for UnrealEd 3).</p>\n<p><b>Slim:</b>\
      \ I take back what I last said, since it appears <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external text\" href=\"http://beyondunreal.com/daedalus/singlepost.php?id=6277\"\
      >you are wrong</a> El Muerte&#160;;) (Thanks to Uncommon for the link). Well,\
      \ wrong about there not being a Mac/Linux port of UnrealED for the new UnrealEngine3\
      \ anyway. Looks like the Mac is actually getting some attention after all these\
      \ years... well... <i>Don't one hold your breath</i></p>\n<p><b>El Muerte:</b>\
      \ I'm not wrong, that link that you posted just confirms what I said. Don't\
      \ mix up UnrealEd 3 and UnrealEngine3. UnrealEd 3 is part of UnrealEngine2 (what\
      \ UT200x uses).</p>\n<p><b>Slim:</b> Oh. Sorry I misunderstood the concept of\
      \ \"Platform Independant\".</p>\n<p><b>Evilmrfrank:</b> Maybe you shouldn't\
      \ make the statement that Unreal Engine 2 is UT200x because UT2007 would also\
      \ be considered 200x. And wasn't Digital Extremes more of a Co Creator of the\
      \ game since it was pretty much Epic who created it mostly with the help of\
      \ Digital Extremes.</p>\n<p><b>Dark Pulse:</b> If you mean Unreal Tournament,\
      \ then yes, it was a bit more of a co-creation (But about 65/35 DE I think.)\
      \ UT2003 was mostly DE's project as well, and Epic basically got involved when\
      \ they decided to port it to PC as UT2003. UT2004 was more of a Epic spearhead,\
      \ though DE contributed some stuff, and there was also a lot of community stuff\
      \ from guys like Teddie Tapawan and Hourences.</p>\n<p>UT2007 will be nearly\
      \ entirely Epic, as it seems that they and DE have since ceased on collaborating\
      \ for Unreal Projects, and the lackluster sales of Pariah certainly didn't help.\
      \ Perhaps Dark Sector will redeem them, but we won't see that for a year or\
      \ two now. Epic has some big shoes to fill, as the general community consensus\
      \ is DE made the better maps of the games.</p>\n<p><b>Evilmrfrank:</b> Thats\
      \ what I thought. Then shouldn't the statement under \"Developer\" be changed\
      \ to include Epic?</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b> Removed To Do tag. I can't think\
      \ of anything that needs work here.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"/Category:Legacy_Game\"\

      \ Nothing stood in its path, nothing could compare to it in any way. When Epic\
      \ first announced their own competitive multiplayer FPS game building up on\
      \ their inhouse Engine they had used for their incredibly successful single\
      \ player FPS Unreal, most people didn't take them very seriously considering\
      \ the giant fanbase of the Quake series.\n\nUT developed by [http://www.digitalextremes.com\
      \ Digital Extremes] was published in November 1999 by [http://www.gtinteractive.com/\
      \ GT Interactive] for PC and was later released for PS2, [[Legacy:Linux|Linux]],\
      \ Dreamcast and [[Legacy:Mac|Mac]]. Quake III was published around the same\
      \ time but offered little new, whereas UT could offer multiple game modes from\
      \ simple Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Domination, Last Man\
      \ Standing to Assault, new Movement types (Dodging), more diverse weapons with\
      \ multiple firing modes that could be combined, intelligent Bots, it could be\
      \ modded easily and and could provide one thing most of all: FUN!!! (lots of\
      \ it)\n\nUT won several game of the year awards and a GOTY (Game Of The Year)\
      \ Edition was released that contained additional free content like maps, skins,\
      \ models etc. that the developers had released to the community before in the\
      \ form of several free bonus packs. This development philosophy to improve and\
      \ enhance the product with free bonus stuff has become characteristic of the\
      \ UT series and was continued in the sequel of UT [[Legacy:UT2003|Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003]] that was published in late 2002. It helped to build up the large Unreal\
      \ community that today is stronger than ever before. Since the release of UT\
      \ Quake and its successors have had to live under the ever growing shadow of\
      \ the Unreal franchise. \n\n[http://www.unrealtournament.com Official Website]\n\
      \n==Reviews ==\n\nRead what [http://pc.ign.com/ IGNPC] had to say about UT in\
      \ their review 1999:\n\nUnreal Tournament is getting the highest score that\
      \ IGNPC has ever given a game. Simply put, Epic has earned it by delivering\
      \ a title that is as close to flawless as I've ever seen, both in its ability\
      \ to entertain and in its finely honed technology and presentation. While there's\
      \ no doubt that Quake III is a powerfully addictive game with some advantages\
      \ over Unreal, I feel like, in the long run, Unreal Tournament will be the better\
      \ of the two games. Still, Tal is currently working on his Quake III review\
      \ and you'll have to wait until next week to see our head-to-head comparison\
      \ of the two games. In the end though, none of this really matters - this is\
      \ a title that will keep you (and your friends) busy for a very long time to\
      \ come. Go buy it. \n\nMore reviews can be found on [http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/191945.asp\

      \ I think a bit more info would be nice\n\n'''CH3Z:''' Shaping up, but, \"...was\
      \ published in 2003. Some years later...\" What year is it again?? =P\n\n'''Nik:'''\
      \ I tried to give a history of UT from a historical point of view, my first\
      \ ever wiki page, sorry CH3Z I still don't quite get the hang on this. :-)\n\
      \n'''Tarquin:''' No worries, Nik. Welcome to the wiki :) Mistakes aren't a problem\
      \ here, we correct each other's.\n\n'''CH3Z:''' Np Nik, thx for taking the initiative,\
      \ I just didn't want to change it because I thought you might have more of an\
      \ idea where you trying to take it then I had. Wanted to give you a welcome\
      \ to Unreal Wiki in your personal page but I don't see it yet. Anyway, welcome\
      \ aboard, Nik. :cool:\n\n'''FragBait:''' I Wouldn't Use Anything Below:\n\n\
      1 GHz processor, 256 MB Ram, and 1 GB free hard-disk space for all that stuff\
      \ you download\n\n(for those who haven't figured out im just kidding)\n\n'''RDGDanClark:'''\
      \ A minor edit, I changed the release of UT2003 to \"late 2002\"  :)  Can you\
      \ guys believe it's almost a year old?\n\n'''Rasterbator:''' How about a port\
      \ to OS X for UnrealEd2? I have been wanting to create maps and textures, but\
      \ really don't want to buy a Microsoft product (Virtual PC) to do it. I am running\
      \ UT GOTY edition with 436 patch, and playing on OS X with the latest Beat Preview\
      \ for OS X (no problems - runs just as well as in OS 9). Anybody know if this\
      \ is being worked on?\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I don't think there's been any official\
      \ word on this, however, I believe UnrealEd and the older builds of the engine\
      \ are essentially unsupported by Epic now. To my knowledge, porting UCC and\
      \ UnrealEd to Mac and Linux is a very low priority, but on the \"eventual\"\
      \ list. However, when they do do so, I strongly suspect it will be the latest\
      \ version of the editor that they port.\n\n'''Dark Pulse:''' I believe it's\
      \ been said many a time that the older UnrealEd (Not sure of Version 3) had\
      \ a lot of ''x86'' specific code and as such porting it would be a total pain\
      \ in the ass. Of course, that's not to say someone couldn't do it... it'd just\
      \ take a lot of time, a lot of headaches, and without a Code Dump, probably\
      \ reverse-enginerring of some sort.\n\n'''Slim:''' There are a few rumours flying\
      \ around and hitting people that suggest Epic are probably working on (or may\
      \ be going to start working on) UED for OS 10. I've no idea if this is true\
      \ or not. Probably not. Although it wouldn't surprise me if it was true since\
      \ one of the main reasons UED never got released for the original Unreal Tournament\
      \ was because of the porters of the mac version; Westlake Interactive. And since\
      \ Epic took over the Mac production (go Epic) I suspected that it would get\
      \ a lot more attention than it's predeccesor did. I've added a new page to put\
      \ in some details about the [[Legacy:Mac|Mac]] version too if that's okay.\n\
      \n'''El Muerte:''' The new UnrealEd (4?) that comes with the UnrealEngine3 will\
      \ be platform independed. Older versions of UnrealEd will never get a Mac (or\
      \ Linux) port. The reason why UnrealEd 2 was never ported to Mac (or Linux)\
      \ was because too much of its code base used win32 libraries (same goes for\
      \ UnrealEd 3).\n\n'''Slim:''' I take back what I last said, since it appears\
      \ [http://beyondunreal.com/daedalus/singlepost.php?id=6277 you are wrong] El\
      \ Muerte ;) (Thanks to Uncommon for the link). Well, wrong about there not being\
      \ a Mac/Linux port of UnrealED for the new UnrealEngine3 anyway. Looks like\
      \ the Mac is actually getting some attention after all these years... well...\
      \ ''Don't one hold your breath''\n\n'''El Muerte:''' I'm not wrong, that link\
      \ that you posted just confirms what I said. Don't mix up UnrealEd 3 and UnrealEngine3.\
      \ UnrealEd 3 is part of UnrealEngine2 (what UT200x uses).\n\n'''Slim:''' Oh.\
      \ Sorry I misunderstood the concept of \"Platform Independant\".\n\n'''Evilmrfrank:'''\
      \ Maybe you shouldn't make the statement that Unreal Engine 2 is  UT200x because\
      \ UT2007 would also be considered 200x.  And wasn't Digital Extremes more of\
      \ a Co Creator of the game since it was pretty much Epic who created it mostly\
      \ with the help of Digital Extremes.\n\n'''Dark Pulse:''' If you mean Unreal\
      \ Tournament, then yes, it was a bit more of a co-creation (But about 65/35\
      \ DE I think.) UT2003 was mostly DE's project as well, and Epic basically got\
      \ involved when they decided to port it to PC as UT2003. UT2004 was more of\
      \ a Epic spearhead, though DE contributed some stuff, and there was also a lot\
      \ of community stuff from guys like Teddie Tapawan and Hourences.\n\nUT2007\
      \ will be nearly entirely Epic, as it seems that they and DE have since ceased\
      \ on collaborating for Unreal Projects, and the lackluster sales of Pariah certainly\
      \ didn't help. Perhaps Dark Sector will redeem them, but we won't see that for\
      \ a year or two now. Epic has some big shoes to fill, as the general community\
      \ consensus is DE made the better maps of the games.\n\n'''Evilmrfrank:''' Thats\
      \ what I thought.  Then shouldn't the statement under \"Developer\" be changed\
      \ to include Epic?\n\n'''SuperApe:''' Removed To Do tag.  I can't think of anything\
      \ that needs work here.\n\n----\n\n[[:Category:Legacy Game]]<br />[[:Category:Legacy\
