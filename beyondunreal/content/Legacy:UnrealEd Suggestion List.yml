      <p>would be great if i could undock the viewports and move them where ever on\
      \ my desktop. i have a 2 monitor layout for video editing, why not map editing?\
      \ i would at least like to see a 1x3 split of the view ports, again i have the\
      \ screen space and the ability to span the desktop, give me some way of utilizing\
      \ the whole thing.</p>\n<p><b>EricBlade:</b> You can maximize UEd across both\
      \ monitors, and simulate that, though it takes some manual window adjusting.\
      \ In UEd for ut04 and land of the dead, I put the browser windows on the second\
      \ monitor, and keep the main window on the center. I do have three, though,\
      \ but putting any part of UED on the left-hand monitor, which is run by an ancient\
      \ ATI Rage video card, is unsuccessful. In UE3, however, I am able to maximize\
      \ my Editor view across the two Radeon driven monitors, putting the 2D viewports\
      \ on the right monitor, and hte 3D viewport on the middle, and the Browsers\
      \ will sit on the left-hand monitor, without screwing up the rest of the editor\
      \ and Windows itself, unlike UT04/Lotd.</p>\n<p><b>DawnTreader:</b> I agree\
      \ that it is possible to get more screen space in UE3, i even ran it with the\
      \ program max to desktop for more space. but i would like to have all four views\
      \ available when i make the perspective viewport 1/2 of my screen. all the programs\
      \ i use where i have control over the interface, adobe after effects, photoshop\
      \ and the like, i maximize the most important panels as much as I can. in AE\
      \ it is the timeline and the viewport for the composition, the timeline is on\
      \ the lower 1/2 on my 22inch wide and the viewport is on my 19 maxed to the\
      \ screen size. i would just like to have more control over the interface. i\
      \ think turning the viewports into floating panels would do that.</p>\n\n<!--\
