      <p>In general, a Jailbreak map is similar to a <a href=\"/Legacy:CTF\" title=\"\
      Legacy:CTF\" class=\"mw-redirect\">CTF</a> in that both teams have a base of\
      \ some sort which contains a valuable target. The main difference is, of course\
      \ that the flag has been replaced by a jail release mechanism, and that this\
      \ jail release mechanism only becomes a viable target when one or more of a\
      \ player's team mates have become captured.</p>\n<p>The differences in gameplay\
      \ have several consequences for map design as well. These are strictly conceptual\
      \ guidelines, not a must of any sort. Because there is no true \"objective\"\
      \ until a team mate has been imprisoned, there should be a motivation for a\
      \ team to venture out of their base, other than reaching the enemy's. This motivation\
      \ could take the form of a weapon not available in the bases, a powerup, or\
      \ the like.</p>\n<p>As always, everything to do with red is 0 and blue is 1.</p>\n\

      <p>Each team needs a base. This needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a jail release mechanism</li>\n\
      <li>player starts, set with JBPlayerStart actors. Note that Jailbreak never\
      \ uses the regular PlayerStart class.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is much like a base\
      \ for <a href=\"/Legacy:CTF\" title=\"Legacy:CTF\" class=\"mw-redirect\">CTF</a>\
      \ – anything goes. However, due to the fact that a player, upon simply reaching\
      \ a release mechanism, has accomplished his goal and does not have to return\
      \ to his base in order to score, the mechanism or the complete base may be better\
      \ defended than it would be in a CTF, since a player only need pass the defense\
      \ points once.</p>\n<p>Also, successfully invading the base doesn't score a\
      \ point, in <i>prohibits scoring</i> for the enemy team. So whereas a base that\
      \ is easy to attack in CTF produces high scores and fast action, in Jailbreak\
      \ it will tend to result in a null tie and a dull game.</p>\n<p>The jail release\
      \ mechanism is an actor of the class TeamActivatedTrigger. Specifics on this\
      \ actor are given on the <a href=\"/Legacy:Jailbreak/Classes\" title=\"Legacy:Jailbreak/Classes\"\
      >Jailbreak/Classes</a> page.</p>\n<p>Placement of PlayerStarts is not as important\
      \ as in CTF: players will only spawn there at the start of the game and on release\
      \ from the arena. At all other times they spawn in jail and walk out upon release.</p>\n\
      <p>The viewpoint can be made to follow an <a href=\"/Legacy:Interpolated_Path\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Interpolated Path\">interpolated path</a> or attached to a\
      \ mover (see <a href=\"/Legacy:Mover_Topics\" title=\"Legacy:Mover Topics\"\
      >Mover Topics</a> for more).</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jails\"\

      Edit section: Jails\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>The map needs two jails. These each need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A JailZone actor\
      \ to define the zone</li>\n<li>A JBViewpoint actor which sets the capture viewpoint\
      \ for the scoring team</li>\n<li>A means of exit which is triggered by the jail\
      \ release mechanism, a TeamActivatedTrigger actor</li>\n<li>player starts, set\
      \ with JBPlayerStart actors. These need the bJailedStart flag set. It's good\
      \ design to set these facing the exit, so players that are killed moments before\
      \ the jail doors are about to close can run out.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A jail should\
      \ be sealed insofar that a player, without help and without the use of a translocator,\
      \ but with an impact hammer should not be able to leave the jail. The exit,\
      \ triggered by the jail release mechanism can be a simple door, but could also\
      \ be a kicker, a slide, or what not.</p>\n<p>To ensure correct bot behavior,\
      \ players should be able to leave the jailzone within five seconds of the release\
      \ mechanism's activation. This is due to the fact that a bot, upon releasing\
      \ his teammates, cannot 'see' the release mechanism for that period of time\
      \ to prevent him from incessantly triggering the mechanism until everybody has\
      \ left the jailzone.</p>\n<p>Although no doubt entertaining, it is probably\
      \ inadvisable to create jails in such a fashion that an outside player can kill\
      \ its inmates (although a kill on an already imprisoned player does not count\
      \ towards your score).</p>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Tip:</b> If you want to have the jails\
      \ disregard you for testing purposes, enter <tt>set PlayerPawn bIsPlayer false</tt>\
      \ at the console. With that you can safely \"ghost\" into jails and the arena\
      \ to watch your bots without being subject to those special zones yourself.\
      \ (To revert the change, enter <tt>set PlayerPawn bIsPlayer true</tt>.)</dd>\n\

      <p>The jail area need not be placed directly adjacent to the release mechanism.\
      \ This mechanism will often be deep within an enemy base, and placing the jail\
      \ too deep in the enemy base will only lead to a carnage immediately after the\
      \ jailed prisoner's release. Rather, released prisoners should have a reasonably\
      \ safe route back to their own base, so they may regroup in relative peace and\
      \ mount a new assault. If placed between bases, the jail exit should probably\
      \ face away from the enemy base, so that snipers will not immediately shoot\
      \ the heads off the escapees.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Style\"\

      <p>Weaker players may spend quite some time in jail. Some ideas to alleviate\
      \ the boredom of hard time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sculpt and place the jails in such\
      \ a fashion that a jailed player has a good view of one or several key points\
      \ in the game</li>\n<li>add map <a href=\"/Legacy:Screen\" title=\"Legacy:Screen\"\
      >Screens</a> or <a href=\"/Legacy:CameraSpot\" title=\"Legacy:CameraSpot\">CameraSpots</a>\
      \ so players can watch the action</li>\n<li>add <a href=\"/Legacy:Screen\" title=\"\
      Legacy:Screen\">Screens</a> with web pages, server stats or IRC channels.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Death\">Death</span><span class=\"\

      \ the game marks a point, kills them &amp; shows the carnage to the scoring\
      \ team players. However, it's possible to enhance the standard gibbing with\
      \ a custom death scene.</p>\n<p>If the game finds something that's triggered\
      \ by RedCaptured/BlueCaptured, the standard gibbing after 4 seconds is disabled\
      \ and the game expects the map to kill the prisoners. After ForceKillAfter seconds,\
      \ they're gibbed anyway.</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Viewpoint\"\

      Edit section: Viewpoint\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n\
      <p>Each jail needs a JBViewpoint actor.</p>\n<p>Quote from the JB forums:</p>\n\
      <p>The camera starts at the InterpolationPoint with Position=0 and moves along\
      \ the path. When it arrives at an InterpolationPoint with bEndOfPath=True, it\
      \ stops; otherwise it loops when it arrives at the last InterpolationPoint in\
      \ the path.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To reiterate, if no path is present, JBViewpoint\
      \ actors simply behave like before; that is, they sit there and don't do anything.</li>\n\
      <li>To make a path work with JBViewpoint actors, the individual InterpolationPoint\
      \ actors' bNoDelete property must be set to \"True.\" If it isn't, the JBViewpoint\
      \ will refuse to use this path (and state so in the log). The reason for this\
      \ is replication-related.</li>\n<li>Since the players that were subjected to\
      \ the death sequence start watching from the JBViewpoint much later than the\
      \ players from the capturing team, I have introduced a new JBViewpoint property\
      \ comprehensibly called \"StaticCameraForDyingTeam\" (defaults to \"True\").\
      \ If set to \"True,\" members of the captured team will have their viewpoint\
      \ set to the JBViewpoint's original location without any movement; if set to\
      \ \"False,\" they'll perform the same camera movement as their capturers, starting\
      \ when they switch their viewpoint.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A different matter is that\
      \ you can also (successfully) attach a JBViewpoint to a mover now (Beta 5).\
      \ If you have a normal mover that rotates back and forth, so will the the JBViewpoint.\
      \ If you need rotation in pitch and roll direction too, you might need El's\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:ActorAttacher\" title=\"Legacy:ActorAttacher\">ActorAttacher</a>.</p>\n\
      <p>Or, set the JBViewpoint's RotationRate and set bFixedRotationDir to \"True\"\
      \ and Physics to \"PHYS_Rotating,\" and the JBViewpoint will continuously revolve\
      \ according to its RotationRate.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      <p>The arena is an optional component. It's possible to have more than one.\
      \ Each needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A JBArenaZone actor</li>\n<li>Two JBArenaStart\
      \ actors, with their teams set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It should be an area of the\
      \ map from which it is not possible to escape, or for a specator to fall in.\
      \ Zone it off nicely, and watch out for those impact jumps.</p>\n<p>A subclass\
      \ of ZoneInfo, JBArenaZone, tells the game where to host the fight and holds\
      \ settings on how frequently to stage fights. Add to your arena two JBarenaStarts\
      \ (subclass of playerstart). Set the teamnumber to 0 for the red start and 1\
      \ for the blue. Placing more than one JBArenastart for each team is futile,\
      \ since the system will always grab the first one.</p>\n<p>There are a few more\
      \ things to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't trigger them too often. If you\
      \ set them off too often, it may prove very difficult to get all the players\
      \ in jail at the same time.</li>\n<li>Your arena can be as big or as small as\
      \ you want, and can contain weapons or other pickups. However, all pickups stay\
      \ in the arena and may not be kept by either player win or lose. You can have\
      \ as many arenas in your map as you like. They don't conflict with each other\
      \ and will summon players independently of each other. For best results, set\
      \ their <b>TriggerAfter</b> property so that they're not all triggered at the\
      \ same time.</li>\n</ul>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Tip:</b> If you want to have the arena\

      </dl>\n<dl>\n<dd><b>Tip:</b> In order to shorten the wait time between arena\
      \ fights when testing (or debugging) arenas, here's a bunch of useful console\
      \ commands that temporarily tell the arena to make fights as frequent as possible:<br\
      \ />\n<tt>&#160;&#160;set JBArenaZone TriggerAfter 0</tt><br />\n<tt>&#160;&#160;set\
      \ JBArenaZone TriggerSeconds 2</tt><br />\n<tt>&#160;&#160;set JBArenaZone NextTrigger\
      \ 0</tt><br />\nYou can enter those commands at the console. For more convenience,\
      \ you can also write them to a plain text file (called \"arenatest.txt,\" for\
      \ instance) and simply call with <tt>exec arenatest.txt</tt> at the console\
      \ prompt.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons_and_Items\"\

      \ a Jailbreak game: Release and capture. Both of these require a certain amount\

      <p>The release mechanism at its simplest is an actor of the class TeamActivatedTrigger.\
      \ Set <i>IsJailReleaseMechanism</i> to True so bots know that it is a jail release\
      \ switch. It's the responsibility of the mapper to choose an Event name and\
      \ thus tie the TeamActivatedTrigger to the relevant jail doors (or kicker, or\
      \ whatever system releases players).</p>\n<p>Remember that the release switch\
      \ located in the Red base must open the doors of the Blue jail to release the\
      \ Blue players. For headaches induced by the whole red/blue thing, we recommend\
      \ aspirin&#160;;-)</p>\n<p>Note that you can also use a TeamActivatedMechanism\
      \ for making simple team-specific triggers, like for a team-based armory.</p>\n\

      \ is triggered by these, then players will be gibbed after a certain time (how\
      \ much?). It's the responsibility of the mapper to make capture deaths more\
      \ interesting by using these events to trigger something. Note that special\
      \ JailZone subclasses which incorporate a death method (eg PressureJailZone)\
      \ need to have their <i>Tag</i> set to either 'RedCaptured' or 'BlueCaptured'\

  wikitext:
    text: "==General ==\n\nIn general, a Jailbreak map is similar to a [[Legacy:CTF|CTF]]\
      \ in that both teams have a base of some sort which contains a valuable target.\
      \ The main difference is, of course that the flag has been replaced by a jail\
      \ release mechanism, and that this jail release mechanism only becomes a viable\
      \ target when one or more of a player's team mates have become captured. \n\n\
      The differences in gameplay have several consequences for map design as well.\
      \ These are strictly conceptual guidelines, not a must of any sort. Because\
      \ there is no true \"objective\" until a team mate has been imprisoned, there\
      \ should be a motivation for a team to venture out of their base, other than\
      \ reaching the enemy's. This motivation could take the form of a weapon not\
      \ available in the bases, a powerup, or the like.\n\nAs always, everything to\
      \ do with red is 0 and blue is 1.\n\n==Areas ==\n\n===Base ===\n\nEach team\
      \ needs a base. This needs:\n* a jail release mechanism\n* player starts, set\
      \ with JBPlayerStart actors. Note that Jailbreak never uses the regular PlayerStart\
      \ class.\n\nThis is much like a base for [[Legacy:CTF|CTF]] &ndash; anything\
      \ goes. However, due to the fact that a player, upon simply reaching a release\
      \ mechanism, has accomplished his goal and does not have to return to his base\
      \ in order to score, the mechanism or the complete base may be better defended\
      \ than it would be in a CTF, since a player only need pass the defense points\
      \ once.\n\nAlso, successfully invading the base doesn't score a point, in ''prohibits\
      \ scoring'' for the enemy team. So whereas a base that is easy to attack in\
      \ CTF produces high scores and fast action, in Jailbreak it will tend to result\
      \ in a null tie and a dull game.\n\nThe jail release mechanism is an actor of\
      \ the class TeamActivatedTrigger. Specifics on this actor are given on the [[Legacy:Jailbreak/Classes|Jailbreak/Classes]]\
      \ page.\n\nPlacement of PlayerStarts is not as important as in CTF: players\
      \ will only spawn there at the start of the game and on release from the arena.\
      \ At all other times they spawn in jail and walk out upon release.\n\nThe viewpoint\
      \ can be made to follow an [[Legacy:Interpolated Path|interpolated path]] or\
      \ attached to a mover (see [[Legacy:Mover Topics|Mover Topics]] for more).\n\
      \n===Jails ===\n\nThe map needs two jails. These each need:\n* A JailZone actor\
      \ to define the zone\n* A JBViewpoint actor which sets the capture viewpoint\
      \ for the scoring team\n* A means of exit which is triggered by the jail release\
      \ mechanism, a TeamActivatedTrigger actor \n* player starts, set with JBPlayerStart\
      \ actors. These need the bJailedStart flag set. It's good design to set these\
      \ facing the exit, so players that are killed moments before the jail doors\
      \ are about to close can run out.\n\nA jail should be sealed insofar that a\
      \ player, without help and without the use of a translocator, but with an impact\
      \ hammer should not be able to leave the jail. The exit, triggered by the jail\
      \ release mechanism can be a simple door, but could also be a kicker, a slide,\
      \ or what not. \n\nTo ensure correct bot behavior, players should be able to\
      \ leave the jailzone within five seconds of the release mechanism's activation.\
      \ This is due to the fact that a bot, upon releasing his teammates, cannot 'see'\
      \ the release mechanism for that period of time to prevent him from incessantly\
      \ triggering the mechanism until everybody has left the jailzone.\n\nAlthough\
      \ no doubt entertaining, it is probably inadvisable to create jails in such\
      \ a fashion that an outside player can kill its inmates (although a kill on\
      \ an already imprisoned player does not count towards your score). \n\n:'''Tip:'''\
      \  If you want to have the jails disregard you for testing purposes, enter <tt>set\
      \ PlayerPawn bIsPlayer false</tt> at the console.  With that you can safely\
      \ \"ghost\" into jails and the arena to watch your bots without being subject\
      \ to those special zones yourself.  (To revert the change, enter <tt>set PlayerPawn\
      \ bIsPlayer true</tt>.)\n\n====Placement ====\n\nThe jail area need not be placed\
      \ directly adjacent to the release mechanism. This mechanism will often be deep\
      \ within an enemy base, and placing the jail too deep in the enemy base will\
      \ only lead to a carnage immediately after the jailed prisoner's release. Rather,\
      \ released prisoners should have a reasonably safe route back to their own base,\
      \ so they may regroup in relative peace and mount a new assault. If placed between\
      \ bases, the jail exit should probably face away from the enemy base, so that\
      \ snipers will not immediately shoot the heads off the escapees.\n\n====Style\
      \ ====\n\nWeaker players may spend quite some time in jail. Some ideas to alleviate\
      \ the boredom of hard time:\n* sculpt and place the jails in such a fashion\
      \ that a jailed player has a good view of one or several key points in the game\n\
      * add map [[Legacy:Screen|Screen]]s or [[Legacy:CameraSpot|CameraSpot]]s so\
      \ players can watch the action\n* add [[Legacy:Screen|Screen]]s with web pages,\
      \ server stats or IRC channels.\n\n====Death ====\n\nWhen all players of one\
      \ team are held in their jail, the game marks a point, kills them & shows the\
      \ carnage to the scoring team players. However, it's possible to enhance the\
      \ standard gibbing with a custom death scene.\n\nIf the game finds something\
      \ that's triggered by RedCaptured/BlueCaptured, the standard gibbing after 4\
      \ seconds is disabled and the game expects the map to kill the prisoners. After\
      \ ForceKillAfter seconds, they're gibbed anyway.\n\n====Viewpoint ====\n\nEach\
      \ jail needs a JBViewpoint actor.\n\nQuote from the JB forums:\n\nThe camera\
      \ starts at the InterpolationPoint with Position=0 and moves along the path.\
      \  When it arrives at an InterpolationPoint with bEndOfPath=True, it stops;\
      \ otherwise it loops when it arrives at the last InterpolationPoint in the path.\
      \ \n\n* To reiterate, if no path is present, JBViewpoint actors simply behave\
      \ like before; that is, they sit there and don't do anything.\n* To make a path\
      \ work with JBViewpoint actors, the individual InterpolationPoint actors' bNoDelete\
      \ property must be set to \"True.\"  If it isn't, the JBViewpoint will refuse\
      \ to use this path (and state so in the log).  The reason for this is replication-related.\n\
      * Since the players that were subjected to the death sequence start watching\
      \ from the JBViewpoint much later than the players from the capturing team,\
      \ I have introduced a new JBViewpoint property comprehensibly called \"StaticCameraForDyingTeam\"\
      \ (defaults to \"True\").  If set to \"True,\" members of the captured team\
      \ will have their viewpoint set to the JBViewpoint's original location without\
      \ any movement; if set to \"False,\" they'll perform the same camera movement\
      \ as their capturers, starting when they switch their viewpoint.\n\nA different\
      \ matter is that you can also (successfully) attach a JBViewpoint to a mover\
      \ now (Beta 5).  If you have a normal mover that rotates back and forth, so\
      \ will the the JBViewpoint.  If you need rotation in pitch and roll direction\
      \ too, you might need El's [[Legacy:ActorAttacher|ActorAttacher]].\n\nOr, set\
      \ the JBViewpoint's RotationRate and set bFixedRotationDir to \"True\" and Physics\
      \ to \"PHYS_Rotating,\" and the JBViewpoint will continuously revolve according\
      \ to its RotationRate.\n\n===Arena ===\n\nThe arena is an optional component.\
      \ It's possible to have more than one. Each needs:\n* A JBArenaZone actor\n\
      * Two JBArenaStart actors, with their teams set.\n\nIt should be an area of\
      \ the map from which it is not possible to escape, or for a specator to fall\
      \ in. Zone it off nicely, and watch out for those impact jumps. \n\nA subclass\
      \ of ZoneInfo, JBArenaZone, tells the game where to host the fight and holds\
      \ settings on how frequently to stage fights. Add to your arena two JBarenaStarts\
      \ (subclass of playerstart). Set the teamnumber to 0 for the red start and 1\
      \ for the blue. Placing more than one JBArenastart for each team is futile,\
      \ since the system will always grab the first one.\n\nThere are a few more things\
      \ to keep in mind:\n* Don't trigger them too often. If you set them off too\
      \ often, it may prove very difficult to get all the players in jail at the same\
      \ time.\n* Your arena can be as big or as small as you want, and can contain\
      \ weapons or other pickups. However, all pickups stay in the arena and may not\
      \ be kept by either player win or lose. You can have as many arenas in your\
      \ map as you like. They don't conflict with each other and will summon players\
      \ independently of each other. For best results, set their '''TriggerAfter'''\
      \ property so that they're not all triggered at the same time.\n\n:'''Tip:'''\
      \  If you want to have the arena disregard you for testing purposes, enter <tt>set\
      \ PlayerPawn bIsPlayer false</tt> at the console.  With that you can safely\
      \ \"ghost\" into jails and the arena to watch your bots without being subject\
      \ to those special zones yourself.  (To revert the change, enter <tt>set PlayerPawn\
      \ bIsPlayer true</tt>.)\n\n:'''Tip:'''  In order to shorten the wait time between\
      \ arena fights when testing (or debugging) arenas, here's a bunch of useful\
      \ console commands that temporarily tell the arena to make fights as frequent\
      \ as possible: <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;set JBArenaZone TriggerAfter 0</tt> <br\
      \ /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;set JBArenaZone TriggerSeconds 2</tt> <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;set\
      \ JBArenaZone NextTrigger 0</tt> <br />You can enter those commands at the console.\
      \  For more convenience, you can also write them to a plain text file (called\
      \ \"arenatest.txt,\" for instance) and simply call with <tt>exec arenatest.txt</tt>\
      \ at the console prompt.\n\n==Weapons and Items ==\n\nWhen placing weapons,\
      \ keep in mind that Jailbreak will probably be played with weaponstay off. (The\
      \ Mothership servers have weaponstay on.) This adds weapons distribution as\
      \ a strategic element. It also some way towards alleviating the imbalance between\
      \ a team whose players are all free and one with members imprisoned, since relatively\
      \ more weapons will be available on the side of the 'losing' team.\n\n===Translocator\
      \ ===\n\nJailbreak equips players with a translocator but disallows its use\
      \ on a zone by zone basis. To allow players to translocate into a zone, the\
      \ [[Legacy:ZoneInfo|ZoneInfo]]'s '''ZoneTag''' must begin with the string \"\
      JBTransloc\".\n\n==Bot Support ==\n\nPathnoding is very similar to [[Legacy:CTF|CTF]].\
      \ Bots use [[Legacy:DefensePoint|DefensePoint]]s and [[Legacy:AmbushPoint|AmbushPoint]]s.\
      \ Also, bots will use altpaths, although the return only variable has no meaning\
      \ in this context. Be sure to pathnode a route out of the jail.\n\nAgain, much\
      \ of the above is simply a guideline and is in no way binding.\n\n:Bots may\
      \ have trouble finding the release switch. Try lowering it slightly, this usually\
      \ fixes the problem. \n::This was an occasional problem in 205, may no longer\
      \ be an issue with 300  &rarr;[[Legacy:Tarquin|Tarquin]] \n:'''Tip:''' When\
      \ spectating your bots to check their gameplay and your botpathing, sorting\
      \ the scoreboard by bot orders is very handy: It displays all attacking bots\
      \ at the top, all defending bots below, and jailed bots at the bottom. Simply\
      \ press F1 to display the scoreboard and then press GreyStar [*] (by default;\
      \ or the key you bound to \"Switch compass/scoreboard order\") until the status\
      \ line below the scoreboard reads \"Scoreboard sorted by <b>Orders</b>\".\n\n\
      ==Team Settings ==\n\nA quick run-down of the actors and settings required for\
      \ Jailbreak to work. Remember to set the '''DefaultGameType''' in the [[Legacy:Level\
      \ Properties|level properties]] to \"JailBreak\"!\n\n===PlayerStarts ===\n\n\
      The map must not contain any ordinary PlayerStart actors. \n; Main area : JBPlayerStart.\
      \ Set JBPlayerStart -> bJailedStart = False\n; Jail : JBPlayerStart. Set JBPlayerStart\
      \ -> bJailedStart = True  Several are needed in each jail, maybe 4-6.\n; Arena\
      \ : JBArenaStart.\n\nIn all cases, set PlayerStart -> TeamNumber to 0 (red)\
      \ or 1 (blue).\n\n===JailZone ===\n* Red Jail: holds red players prisoner. JailedTeam\
      \ = 0\n* Blue Jail: holds blue players prisoner. JailedTeam = 1 \n\n===Release\
      \ Switch ===\n\nThis is an actor of the class TeamActivatedTrigger. Set:\n*\
      \ isJailReleaseMechanism = true\n* Team:\n** Defended by blue, releases the\
      \ red team: Team = 0\n** Defended by red, releases the blue team: Team = 1\n\
      * Event so something happens to let players out. It's also a good idea to trigger\
      \ some sort of visual cue so the player activating knows they have suceeded\
      \ (a lever moving for example).\n\n==Dynamics ==\n\nThere are two main incidents\
      \ that take place during a Jailbreak game: Release and capture. Both of these\
      \ require a certain amount of work on the part of the mapper:\n\n===Release\
      \ ===\n\nThe release mechanism at its simplest is an actor of the class TeamActivatedTrigger.\
      \ Set ''IsJailReleaseMechanism'' to True so bots know that it is a jail release\
      \ switch. It's the responsibility of the mapper to choose an Event name and\
      \ thus tie the TeamActivatedTrigger to the relevant jail doors (or kicker, or\
      \ whatever system releases players).\n\nRemember that the release switch located\
      \ in the Red base must open the doors of the Blue jail to release the Blue players.\
      \ For headaches induced by the whole red/blue thing, we recommend aspirin ;-)\n\
      \nNote that you can also use a TeamActivatedMechanism for making simple team-specific\
      \ triggers, like for a team-based armory.\n\n===Capture ===\n\nThe game automatically\
      \ fires events 'RedCaptured' and 'BlueCaptured' when all players of a team are\
      \ in the jail. If nothing is triggered by these, then players will be gibbed\
      \ after a certain time (how much?). It's the responsibility of the mapper to\
      \ make capture deaths more interesting by using these events to trigger something.\
      \ Note that special JailZone subclasses which incorporate a death method (eg\
      \ PressureJailZone) need to have their ''Tag'' set to either 'RedCaptured' or\
      \ 'BlueCaptured' by the mapper to function.\n\n:'''Tip:''' Because the capture\
      \ events are built into the game type, you won't see red lines connecting actors\
      \ which are triggered by them. If you find this disturbing, or just to check\
      \ things are properly connected, create dummy triggers either outside the level\
      \ or set so nothing can collide with it & give them the each a capture event.\n\
      \n==Finishing Touches ==\n\nAs well as a [[Legacy:Screenshot|screenshot]], a\
      \ Jailbreak map can incoporate a Map Banner and HUD Skins. \n\nThe map banner\
      \ is displayed on the HUD during pre-play flyby. This is created by embedding\
      \ one or two 256x128 textures in the [[Legacy:MyLevel|MyLevel]] package, named\
      \ \"SkinMapBanner1\", and optionally \"SkinMapBanner2\" to make a wider banner.\n\
      \nThese textures must both be referenced in the map (by an actor, or discreetly\
      \ on a surface somewhere) otherwise UnrealEd will discard them on saving.\n\n\
      It is also possible to embed entire custom HUD skins in maps.  See the [http://www.ph.tum.de/~mkath/jb/jbskintutorial.html\
      \ HUD skinning tutorial] for details.\n\n==Map Standards ==\n\n[[Legacy:ElBundee|ElBundee]]\
      \ came up with the \"'''Jailbreak seal of approval'''\", a short list of useful\
      \ things each Jailbreak mapper should take care of:\n* DefaultGametype set to\
      \ Jailbreak \n* JBPlayerStarts in jail: at least 3 each jail\n* JBPlayerStarts\
      \ outside: at least upper IdealPlayerCount / 2 + 1 each team \n* No normal [[Legacy:PlayerStart|PlayerStart]]s\
      \ left\n* Set all JailDoorMovers to \"CrushWhenEncroach\" \n* Map Logo\n* LocationStrings\
      \ wherever possible for [[Legacy:Zone|Zone]]s\n* Translocator support (if any)\
      \ \n* JBViewpoints ( = DeathCams): 1 each jail\n* Arena (optional)\n* Jail escape\
      \ routes (optional)\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://forums.beyondunreal.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=382\
