      \ I could do it better than other people. I'm not so convinced that I was wrong,\
      \ but it was a sad, sad thing. I wasn't going to program for it. I wasn't going\
      \ to level design. Nope, no models... no sound fx. No, my great contribution\
      \ was design and story, the two least valuable products in the mod community.</p>\n\
      <p>And you know what? That was the <b>only</b> time I ended up with a hard working\
      \ team. It pretty well broke up later on due to life issues with some and probably\
      \ burnout on others (see first paragraph.) I ended up releasing a pretty decent\
      \ MP mod that had nothing to do with what was originally planned, and it was\

      \ I can think of to get people to just work on <i><b>something</b></i>. I've\
      \ tried giving them creative influence, I've tried giving them a totally solid\
      \ and complete design layout. I've TOLD them EXACTLY what they need to do, just\
      \ hoping that they might do it and accidentally find themselves doing something\
      \ else afterwards. But no... I end up having to do it myself.</p>\n<p>It doesn't\
      \ bother me if people don't want to work on my mod. That's FINE! If everyone\
      \ just said \"No, I wanna do my own thing,\" or \"you sux0rz g0 t00 h3llzzz\"\
      \ I would not hate them except for not recognising the difference between 'to'\
      \ and 'too.' But that's not what happens! It's more like this:</p>\n<p><b>Haral</b>:\
      \ blah blah blah talk about project blah blah</p>\n<p><b>Whoever</b>: That's\
      \ rad, can I work on it?</p>\n<p><b>Haral</b>: Yeah I guess. You gotta keep\
      \ up with the work though, I don't have any need for another name.</p>\n<p><b>Whoever</b>:\
      \ Totally!</p>\n<p>A couple weeks goes by...</p>\n<p><b>Haral</b>: So are you\
      \ going to do anything?</p>\n<p><b>Whoever</b>: Yeah, I've just been really\
      \ busy.</p>\n<p>Busy? I HATE YOU. Busy playing games? Busy watching tv? Busy\
      \ staring at a wall? These are things I've actually found the people were doing!</p>\n\
      <p>I am constantly trying to make things easier for other people to get their\
      \ work done. I tell them that if there's anything stopping them from getting\
      \ something done, <i>tell me</i>. All I get, however, is <b>I'm busy.</b> I'm\
      \ not asking you out on a date! You aren't busy! <b>I AM</b>. Busy getting things\
      \ done while you sit there wasting space! I have a full time job. I go to school.\
      \ I hang out with my friends. I keep a social life. I still get things done.</p>\n\
      <p>If any of you people are out there reading this, come to grips with reality:</p>\n\
      <p><b>You are not busy. You have the time. You just don't want to spend it.</b></p>\n\
      <p>If you don't want to take the time, that's fine. Just stop wasting <b>my</b>\
      \ time by saying you're gonna keep up.</p>\n<p><b>*deep breath*</b></p>\n<p>What\
      \ in the world am I doing wrong here? How can I get people to actually put forth\
      \ something I can recognise as real effort? I have a hard time even getting\
      \ people to come and test something I'm working on. It's like people think making\
      \ a game is like some mail-order degree. Just sign up for the credit, without\
      \ any of the work! Even worse, it's like people think it's some sort of chore.\
      \ At times it's tedious, but most of the time it's engaging and FUN.</p>\n<p>So\
      \ here's three years of frustration of being stuck doing everything myself:</p>\n\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Disscusion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Nytro:</b> I agree that many in the modding community\
      \ can be lazy. One thing that can help with this problem (in case you haven't\
      \ done this):</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p><b>LazyModder:</b>\
      \ Hey, can I join your mod team?</p>\n<p><b>Haral:</b> What kind of stuff can\
      \ you do?</p>\n<p><b>LazyModder:</b> Uh, I can model stuff.</p>\n<p><b>Haral:</b>\
      \ Show me a screenshot of something you've done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now,\
      \ at this point the <i>really lazy</i> modder will ignore you.</p>\n<p>The <i>not-as-lazy</i>\
      \ modder will give you a screenshot of something not very good. You can then\
      \ tell them that you don't think you need their specific talents at the moment\
      \ (since their talents happen to suck, but *SHH*, don't tell them that). The\
      \ <i>even-less-lazy</i> modder will give you a good screenshot. Then you consider\
      \ accepting them:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p><b>Even-Less-Lazy\
      \ Modder:</b> So, can I join now?</p>\n<p><b>Haral:</b> That screenshot looks\
      \ really good! Try a (thing); if you can do that, I'll know you have the right\
      \ skills.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, now we reach the crossroads between <i>even-less-lazy</i>\
      \ modder and <i>non-lazy</i> modder. If you get a decent (thing), they'll most\
      \ probably give you more once they're in. If you determine that they're not\
      \ <i>non-lazy</i> but just <i>even-less-lazy</i> modder, you then factor in\
      \ how desperate you are to have anyone at all.</p>\n<p><b>Haral:</b> I think\
      \ I'm just cursed. I only recruit for specific talents, and those specific talents\
      \ are only ever modelling and programming. Every one of them has had some sort\
      \ of accomplishment for me to take them aboard. Like the rant says, it was only\
      \ when I was handling things like an idiot did anyone else get things done.\
      \ I think the next thing I'm gonna try is closing my eyes, spinning around,\
      \ and pointing to a day on the calender. Then I'll laugh maniacally and declare,\
      \ \"If you don't have your task done by *whatever date*, you're gone!\" At least\
      \ it'd be more entertaining for me, anyway.</p>\n<p><b>Foxpaw:</b> I'd have\
      \ to agree 100%. I rarely try to recruit the help of others because I'd like\
      \ to have all the code done before I ask people if they will do some art, etc...\
      \ If, for whatever reason, I can't continue to work on it, I don't want to be\
      \ the one letting everyone else down. However, I noticed this phenomenon when\
      \ I was \"lead\" programmer on an online game back in the day. (The actual lead\
      \ programmer I saw twice in the year I was there, so since I was second to him,\
      \ I assumed the role.)</p>\n<p>I'll be the first to admit, I was lazy sometimes\
      \ too. There were times I would rather PLAY the game instead of fixing small\
      \ bugs, which was all that remained at the time. The \"mappers,\" if you would\
      \ call them that, were the worst. Most of them would \"work\" for weeks and\
      \ have nothing to show for it.</p>\n<p>However, having said that - About a year\
      \ ago I was supervisor of a gas station. The cashiers weren't too bad, on account\
      \ of they didn't really have a lot of work to do, but the gas attendants were\
      \ just plain lazy. When new people were hired and I trained them, though, I\
      \ noticed that they were not lazy and would work consistently. I've surmised\
      \ that this was due to a different attitude of myself vs. the person who trained\
      \ these people. The previous trainers gave the attentants a sense that they\
      \ and the trainer (the supervisor) were \"on the same level.\" That's all fine\
      \ and good for comaraderie, and as much as I would like to do half of their\
      \ work plus my own, it's not very efficient when I know that they are perfectly\
      \ capable. The result of that mentality is that since attendant and supervisor\
      \ are placed at the same level, this gives the impression that since the supervisor\
      \ sometimes disappears to do paperwork/whatever, the attendant should be able\
      \ to do the same. This, of course, does not result in very good customer service\
      \ if both people are away at the same time.&#160;:P When I trained people I\
      \ wasn't \"high and mighty,\" about it, but I did ensure to give the impression\
      \ that I couldn't always be there because I had other stuff to do. Some people\
      \ think that this sort of thing will make your staff resent you, but this is\
      \ not the case. I much prefer having a very defined set of responsibilities,\
      \ instead of overlapping responsibilities that can be neglected if you think\
      \ the other person had it taken care of. Unfortunately, since you aren't paying\
      \ the people on your mod team, (generally) this would likely just breed resentment.</p>\n\
      <p>The point is... generally, people don't like to look bad. They know that\
      \ if they shirk their responsibilities they'll look incompetent and lazy. As\
      \ a result, if you give the impression that it needs to be done and noone else\
      \ is going to do it (it's important to do this without being bossy, of course)\
      \ it's a great motivator, because they know they'll be letting down the team\
      \ if they don't do it. On the other hand though, some people are just plain\
      \ lazy, and only want to be a part of the mod so they can see their name in\
      \ the credits and tell people that they were on the modelling team that made\
      \ all that great art, etc.</p>\n<p><b>Kerlin:</b> I'm a database admin by day.\
      \ Yeah, it's uncool but game developers can be a little infantile in project\
      \ planning and development. The absolute best people I've had on my team have\
      \ been people that I mentored. Three prerequisites for getting on the db team:\
      \ creativity (when dealing with 30G of data, this is important), logic (see\
      \ previous), and hunger (willingness to learn). I've \"brought up\" guys in\
      \ my team who have since moved on (after the .com folded). Now years later,\
      \ when I have conversations with them I sometimes find myself saying, \"Really?\
      \ I didn't know you could do that.\".</p>\n<p>My point: Consider finding someone\
      \ hungry. Someone you wouldn't normally consider for the job. Someone who has\
      \ the raw ability but not the polish. Mentor them, push them, rinse, repeat.\
      \ You don't get the attitude (\"my work speaks for itself\", \"i could get on\
      \ any team with my skillz\", etc), they appreciate that you're sharing your\
      \ knowledge, and they'll give you more than what you ask because they want to\
      \ \"prove themselves\". Start up time is a little longer but you're trying to\
      \ make a fine wine, not lemonade, right? You both win in the end.</p>\n<p><b>EntropicLqd:</b>\
      \ I enjoyed reading this - in a sick <i>I feel your pain</i> kind of way. I\
      \ had the sad misfortune to work with a contractor in real life who was way\
      \ more lazy than anyone you describe. He actually created negative work he was\
      \ so bad. One thing to bear in mind .. If you approach someone to work on a\
      \ mod and they tell you they are too busy, keep hold of their contact details.\
      \ If they won't commit because they know they don't have the time you can be\
      \ fairly sure that should you approach them when they do have the time you'll\
      \ get some decent output from them.</p>\n<p><b>NickR:</b> Very interesting read!&#160;:D\
      \ I myself am one of the hungry. I'm always trying to learn new interesting\
      \ aspects of UnrealScript and how I can achieve something. Usually in different\
      \ ways: modular code, flexible code, easy to read code, as little code as possible.\
      \ And because I'm a perfectionist I like to try and combine the lot. I'm coming\
      \ to point where I know so much of that aspect of the Unreal engine I need to\
      \ start to learn another aspect. And since modeling is the most complicated\
      \ aspect (to me anyway), I ventured into the mapping scene with some small success.</p>\n\
      <p>It is also a challenge to attempt to do asmuch of the development of a mod\
      \ as possible on your own. It is a testment to a persons will to complete such\
      \ a project without anyones help. I look forward to releasing my projects that\
      \ I complete myself, because I can take all the credit for it. I'm not one for\
      \ sharing!&#160;:D</p>\n<p><b>Haral:</b> Yeah I know how that is, however the\
      \ way I see it is that to achieve more ambitious goals I'll need the help of\
      \ others. Right now I'm working more or less alone (with assistance, but not\
      \ direct collaboration of anyone else.) I too have taken up learning modeling\
      \ programs and all that. I'm just tired of watching things fall apart on me,\
      \ and the only way to ensure they don't is to be willing to drag it to the end\
      \ by myself.</p>\n<p><b>O-GL:</b> I’ve found that some people just don’t have\
      \ what it takes to make games. It has to be a major part of your life and you\
      \ have to yearn everyday to make something cooler/better.</p>\n<p>You need someone\
      \ on your team that uses their computer all the time to help make something\
      \ relating to games.</p>\n<p>If you get a programmer to join your team during\
      \ the development of the project, and that person has never programmed a game\
      \ before, chances are their desires are not in the right place. Any good team\
      \ member would have spent time on their own making a game because they have\
      \ simply always been interested in it. If they have little to show before they\
      \ join your team, chances are, they’ll have little to show when they leave your\
      \ team.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that modelers are a bit different. They can often\
      \ have a good skill set and do the work you require very well and fast, but\
      \ they tend to pull out before the project is finished. I think most of the\
      \ time this is because they get fed up with the engine or your code making more\
      \ work for them. They tend to get excited by new graphic effects, but when it\
      \ gets boring, they just quit to something more exciting. On the whole, I think\
      \ its good to have modelers doing models and very rough level designs at the\
      \ start of the project to give the programmers something to work with. Even\
      \ if the modelers find they have nothing to do while the programmers work, and\
      \ they leave, you can always go back (hopefully) to get them later. When the\
      \ programmers get the majority of the code done, the modelers can finish the\
      \ project with the guidance of the programmer. Thats what I'm hoping anyway&#160;:tup:.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Haral:</b> Hmm... I'm not so sure. While you certainly don't want anyone\
      \ completely new to programming, (probably not even anyone new to unrealscript)\
      \ those you describe are perhaps the worst. Those who are in love with game\
      \ dev usually want to make their own stuff... and while they might get entranced\
      \ by your design, code challenges, or simply like you, that can wear out quickly\
      \ and they'll wanna split and do something else. I know I often do... I have\
      \ to fight that urge for the sake of getting somewhere.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the\
      \ real issue we should obsess over is sharing. I know I want glory, credit,\
      \ etc as a game designer (not just a programmer.) I also consider myself a good\
      \ designer in general (I'm the best, of course) so I have a lot I'd like to\
      \ get out there. But if you look for a moment, you'll see Foxpaw, NickR, and\
      \ I have haunted each others' space a bit because we're all working on similar\
      \ designs. Each has its own unique aspects (and mine is the best, of course)\
      \ but it's a problem. Each takes away a hard working programmer. Each is competing\
      \ for any additional team members, and if they are completed they are all in\
      \ direct competition for players. If we could all team up and get along, we\
      \ could probably make one incredible mod that would wipe every mod out of the\
      \ water (especially if it was mine, because I'm the best.)</p>\n<p>Will this\
      \ happen? Hmmm... probably not. Ambition cuts both ways. I could let other people\
      \ work with me, but I couldn't give up the reins on design. I like my mod. It's\
      \ the best.</p>\n<p><b>Ryan:</b> I think that putting it down to just laziness\
      \ is a little simplistic. I think that focus is the major factor in determining\
      \ if someone will carry on or not. There are many reasons for people to lose\
      \ focus, RL issues, other interests, biting off more than they can chew. I'm\
      \ sure there are some lazy people around, I've not met any yet though.</p>\n\

      \ You can then tell them that you don't think you need their specific talents\
      \ at the moment (since their talents happen to suck, but *SHH*, don't tell them\
      \ that). The ''even-less-lazy'' modder will give you a good screenshot. Then\
      \ you consider accepting them:\n\n{{innerbox|'''Even-Less-Lazy Modder:''' So,\
      \ can I join now?\n\n'''Haral:''' That screenshot looks really good! Try a (thing);\
      \ if you can do that, I'll know you have the right skills.\n\n}}\n\nSo, now\
      \ we reach the crossroads between ''even-less-lazy'' modder and ''non-lazy''\
      \ modder. If you get a decent (thing), they'll most probably give you more once\
      \ they're in. If you determine that they're not ''non-lazy'' but just ''even-less-lazy''\
      \ modder, you then factor in how desperate you are to have anyone at all.\n\n\
      '''Haral:''' I think I'm just cursed.  I only recruit for specific talents,\
      \ and those specific talents are only ever modelling and programming.  Every\
      \ one of them has had some sort of accomplishment for me to take them aboard.\
      \  Like the rant says, it was only when I was handling things like an idiot\
      \ did anyone else get things done.  I think the next thing I'm gonna try is\
      \ closing my eyes, spinning around, and pointing to a day on the calender. \
      \ Then I'll laugh maniacally and declare, \"If you don't have your task done\
      \ by *whatever date*, you're gone!\"  At least it'd be more entertaining for\
      \ me, anyway.\n\n'''Foxpaw:''' I'd have to agree 100%. I rarely try to recruit\
      \ the help of others because I'd like to have all the code done before I ask\
      \ people if they will do some art, etc... If, for whatever reason, I can't continue\
      \ to work on it, I don't want to be the one letting everyone else down. However,\
      \ I noticed this phenomenon when I was \"lead\" programmer on an online game\
      \ back in the day. (The actual lead programmer I saw twice in the year I was\
      \ there, so since I was second to him, I assumed the role.)\n\nI'll be the first\
      \ to admit, I was lazy sometimes too. There were times I would rather PLAY the\
      \ game instead of fixing small bugs, which was all that remained at the time.\
      \ The \"mappers,\" if you would call them that, were the worst. Most of them\
      \ would \"work\" for weeks and have nothing to show for it.\n\nHowever, having\
      \ said that - About a year ago I was supervisor of a gas station. The cashiers\
      \ weren't too bad, on account of they didn't really have a lot of work to do,\
      \ but the gas attendants were just plain lazy. When new people were hired and\
      \ I trained them, though, I noticed that they were not lazy and would work consistently.\
      \ I've surmised that this was due to a different attitude of myself vs. the\
      \ person who trained these people. The previous trainers gave the attentants\
      \ a sense that they and the trainer (the supervisor) were \"on the same level.\"\
      \ That's all fine and good for comaraderie, and as much as I would like to do\
      \ half of their work plus my own, it's not very efficient when I know that they\
      \ are perfectly capable. The result of that mentality is that since attendant\
      \ and supervisor are placed at the same level, this gives the impression that\
      \ since the supervisor sometimes disappears to do paperwork/whatever, the attendant\
      \ should be able to do the same. This, of course, does not result in very good\
      \ customer service if both people are away at the same time. :P When I trained\
      \ people I wasn't \"high and mighty,\" about it, but I did ensure to give the\
      \ impression that I couldn't always be there because I had other stuff to do.\
      \ Some people think that this sort of thing will make your staff resent you,\
      \ but this is not the case. I much prefer having a very defined set of responsibilities,\
      \ instead of overlapping responsibilities that can be neglected if you think\
      \ the other person had it taken care of. Unfortunately, since you aren't paying\
      \ the people on your mod team, (generally) this would likely just breed resentment.\n\
      \nThe point is... generally, people don't like to look bad. They know that if\
      \ they shirk their responsibilities they'll look incompetent and lazy. As a\
      \ result, if you give the impression that it needs to be done and noone else\
      \ is going to do it (it's important to do this without being bossy, of course)\
      \ it's a great motivator, because they know they'll be letting down the team\
      \ if they don't do it. On the other hand though, some people are just plain\
      \ lazy, and only want to be a part of the mod so they can see their name in\
      \ the credits and tell people that they were on the modelling team that made\
      \ all that great art, etc.\n\n'''Kerlin:''' I'm a database admin by day. Yeah,\
      \ it's uncool but game developers can be a little infantile in project planning\
      \ and development. The absolute best people I've had on my team have been people\
      \ that I mentored. Three prerequisites for getting on the db team: creativity\
      \ (when dealing with 30G of data, this is important), logic (see previous),\
      \ and hunger (willingness to learn). I've \"brought up\" guys in my team who\
      \ have since moved on (after the .com folded). Now years later, when I have\
      \ conversations with them I sometimes find myself saying, \"Really? I didn't\
      \ know you could do that.\". \n\nMy point: Consider finding someone hungry.\
      \ Someone you wouldn't normally consider for the job. Someone who has the raw\
      \ ability but not the polish. Mentor them, push them, rinse, repeat. You don't\
      \ get the attitude (\"my work speaks for itself\", \"i could get on any team\
      \ with my skillz\", etc), they appreciate that you're sharing your knowledge,\
      \ and they'll give you more than what you ask because they want to \"prove themselves\"\
      . Start up time is a little longer but you're trying to make a fine wine, not\
      \ lemonade, right? You both win in the end. \n\n'''EntropicLqd:''' I enjoyed\
      \ reading this - in a sick ''I feel your pain'' kind of way.  I had the sad\
      \ misfortune to work with a contractor in real life who was way more lazy than\
      \ anyone you describe.  He actually created negative work he was so bad.  One\
      \ thing to bear in mind .. If you approach someone to work on a mod and they\
      \ tell you they are too busy, keep hold of their contact details.  If they won't\
      \ commit because they know they don't have the time you can be fairly sure that\
      \ should you approach them when they do have the time you'll get some decent\
      \ output from them.\n\n'''NickR:''' Very interesting read! :D I myself am one\
      \ of the hungry. I'm always trying to learn new interesting aspects of UnrealScript\
      \ and how I can achieve something. Usually in different ways: modular code,\
      \ flexible code, easy to read code, as little code as possible. And because\
      \ I'm a perfectionist I like to try and combine the lot. I'm coming to point\
      \ where I know so much of that aspect of the Unreal engine I need to start to\
      \ learn another aspect. And since modeling is the most complicated aspect (to\
      \ me anyway), I ventured into the mapping scene with some small success. \n\n\
      It is also a challenge to attempt to do asmuch of the development of a mod as\
      \ possible on your own. It is a testment to a persons will to complete such\
      \ a project without anyones help. I look forward to releasing my projects that\
      \ I complete myself, because I can take all the credit for it. I'm not one for\
      \ sharing! :D\n\n'''Haral:''' Yeah I know how that is, however the way I see\
      \ it is that to achieve more ambitious goals I'll need the help of others. \
      \ Right now I'm working more or less alone (with assistance, but not direct\
      \ collaboration of anyone else.)  I too have taken up learning modeling programs\
      \ and all that.  I'm just tired of watching things fall apart on me, and the\
      \ only way to ensure they don't is to be willing to drag it to the end by myself.\n\
      \n'''O-GL:''' I’ve found that some people just don’t have what it takes to make\
      \ games.  It has to be a major part of your life and you have to yearn everyday\
      \ to make something cooler/better.\n\nYou need someone on your team that uses\
      \ their computer all the time to help make something relating to games.  \n\n\
      If you get a programmer to join your team during the development of the project,\
      \ and that person has never programmed a game before, chances are their desires\
      \ are not in the right place.  Any good team member would have spent time on\
      \ their own making a game because they have simply always been interested in\
      \ it.  If they have little to show before they join your team, chances are,\
      \ they’ll have little to show when they leave your team.  \n\nI’ve found that\
      \ modelers are a bit different.  They can often have a good skill set and do\
      \ the work you require very well and fast, but they tend to pull out before\
      \ the project is finished.  I think most of the time this is because they get\
      \ fed up with the engine or your code making more work for them.  They tend\
      \ to get excited by new graphic effects, but when it gets boring, they just\
      \ quit to something more exciting.  On the whole, I think its good to have modelers\
      \ doing models and very rough level designs at the start of the project to give\
      \ the programmers something to work with.  Even if the modelers find they have\
      \ nothing to do while the programmers work, and they leave, you can always go\
      \ back (hopefully) to get them later.  When the programmers get the majority\
      \ of the code done, the modelers can finish the project with the guidance of\
      \ the programmer.  Thats what I'm hoping anyway :tup:.\n\n'''Haral:''' Hmm...\
      \ I'm not so sure.  While you certainly don't want anyone completely new to\
      \ programming, (probably not even anyone new to unrealscript) those you describe\
      \ are perhaps the worst.  Those who are in love with game dev usually want to\
      \ make their own stuff... and while they might get entranced by your design,\
      \ code challenges, or simply like you, that can wear out quickly and they'll\
      \ wanna split and do something else.  I know I often do... I have to fight that\
      \ urge for the sake of getting somewhere.\n\nPerhaps the real issue we should\
      \ obsess over is sharing.  I know I want glory, credit, etc as a game designer\
      \ (not just a programmer.)  I also consider myself a good designer in general\
      \ (I'm the best, of course) so I have a lot I'd like to get out there.  But\
      \ if you look for a moment, you'll see Foxpaw, NickR, and I have haunted each\
      \ others' space a bit because we're all working on similar designs.  Each has\
      \ its own unique aspects (and mine is the best, of course) but it's a problem.\
      \  Each takes away a hard working programmer.  Each is competing for any additional\
      \ team members, and if they are completed they are all in direct competition\
      \ for players.  If we could all team up and get along, we could probably make\
      \ one incredible mod that would wipe every mod out of the water (especially\
      \ if it was mine, because I'm the best.)\n\nWill this happen?  Hmmm... probably\
      \ not.  Ambition cuts both ways.  I could let other people work with me, but\
      \ I couldn't give up the reins on design.  I like my mod.  It's the best.\n\n\
      '''Ryan:''' I think that putting it down to just laziness is a little simplistic.\
      \  I think that focus is the major factor in determining if someone will carry\
      \ on or not.  There are many reasons for people to lose focus, RL issues, other\
      \ interests, biting off more than they can chew.  I'm sure there are some lazy\
      \ people around, I've not met any yet though.\n\n[[Category:Legacy Rant|{{PAGENAME}}]]"
