      \ severely addicted, and have managed to feed that habit irregularly for over\
      \ a decade now, mainly on a hobby basis. more recently i've done 3D work on\
      \ my Mac, making short low-rez movies and higher-rez stills, and writing scripted\
      \ plug-ins for the Mac-based 3D app i use(d).</p>\n<p>i love movies, have some\
      \ background in 16mm filmmaking (see, i really AM old!), and it was the possibilities\
      \ of using game engine tech for movie-like storytelling (aka Machinima) that\
      \ drew me into the Unreal universe. i'm not really much of a game-player, having\
      \ spent the years when gaming grew up, mostly growing my family and career,\
      \ but it's never too late (i hope). my kids got me to play HALO about 18 months\
      \ ago; it fascinated me, and i started paying much greater attention to the\

      \ way back to Atari 800 BASIC, but is limited in depth – a smattering of 6502\
      \ assembly language, some 486-based DOS level BASIC, RealBASIC (OOP) on the\
      \ Mac, Pixelscript (a tcl-based language for extending the aforementioned Mac\
      \ 3D app), AppleScript, and now, Unreal Script. i've always approached programming\
      \ on a pragmatic basis – i learn to code what i need to accomplish a specific\
      \ task – so there's holes in my skills that would easily pass a pachyderm.</p>\n\
      <p>i'm currently planning to resuscitate my web presence, but have to dig up\
      \ sufficient server space to hold a lot of stills and movies, AND the time to\
      \ design and mount a website. i need a Pluterday.</p>\n<p>here, at least, is\
