      \ your masterpiece look like a masterpiece. You really do not need much technical\

      \ do basic geomtery. For example tell me the area of a circle right now! For\
      \ most parts i'm going to approach this as if you were an extreme noob. If you\
      \ still don't get it than you can direct all your curses, hexes and swears at\

      \ title=\"Legacy:Texture Browser\">Texture Browser</a>. As the name implies\
      \ it lets you browse textures. Lets have some fun. What you're seeing right\
      \ now is the standart UT engine textures. If you look at the picture above you'll\
      \ notice that there are two field with drop down menus. One says engine(terrain\
      \ in the pci above) The other with the <i>ALL</i> button next to it might be\
      \ blank. If you click on the drop down arrow that says engine(terrain in pic\
      \ above) you'll see a list of other names. Click on any one and you'll see a\
      \ new set of textures. These are all different texture sets used by the engine\
      \ so they open up by default. Sadly none of these is really a set that you might\
      \ want to use in your map unless you're going for a neo enginistic retro zam\
      \ tastic look. SO let's open a new set of textures.</p>\n<p>Do <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Browser_Menu\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Texture Browser Menu\">Texture Browser Menu</a> -&gt; File\
      \ -&gt; Open and the browser should automatically go to UT\\Textures directory.\
      \ There should be a ton of files in here. Say your maps is a castle themed map.\
      \ So navigate to NaliCast.utx and open. You should see a whole bunch of new\
      \ textures now. Plus the texture pack name should reflect NaliCast now.</p>\n\
      <p>If you haven't already noticed you'll also see a word in the field next to\
      \ <i>ALL</i>, most likely it will say arch. Click the drop down arrow here and\
      \ you'll see other entries like base, walls, floors, ceilings etc. These are\
      \ subdivisions within the pack to allow you to navigate the textures more easily.\
      \ You can view all of them if you like by clicking on the <i>ALL</i> button.</p>\n\
      <p>Other things you can try are to change the viewing size of the textures displayed.\
      \ If you go to</p>\n<p>View -&gt; SetSize or</p>\n<p>View -&gt; Variable</p>\n\
      <p>View -&gt; Docked will dock or undock it from the browser.</p>\n<p>Do keep\
      \ in mind that changing the display size does not affect your textures in the\
      \ game world. That is an issue I will deal with in the following section.</p>\n\
      <p>There is one last thing I would like to point out with the texture browser.\
      \ Click on a texture and it is selected. You can apply it to the ame world now.\
      \ However if you look along the top of the browser window it will give you the\
      \ texture name and size in actual UEd Units. Eg 128x256 WxH.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ a brush. Tada that texture should be on all visible faces of the brush.</p>\n\
      <p>Now I realise that more often than not we might want each face to have differnt\
      \ textures. So select th surface in Perspective View, it should highlight, and\
