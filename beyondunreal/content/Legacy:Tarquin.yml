      \ Unreal when it first came out. The signle-player was far less replayable than\
      \ Quake, but I never tired of Botmatch on DM-Loxi. UnrealEd used to crash at\
      \ the drop of a hat, so it wasn't until version 2 that I really started messing\
      \ around with it. My delvings into the class tree got me as far the the class\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:BrushBuilder\" title=\"Legacy:BrushBuilder\">BrushBuilder</a>,\
      \ which I discovered could be cusomized. I released my pack of brushbuilders\
      \ around February 2001. You can read about them on Russian sites, which I think\
      \ is pretty cool. But then again, small things amuse me, like talking to SpoonDog\
      \ on IRC when it's morning here and, like, whoa dude, night-time there.</p>\n\
      <p>It always bugged me that it was so hard to find stuff on UnrealEd. I personally\
      \ hate tutorials. Hmm... so why do I appear to be half-running a site of them?\
      \ Well, more specifically, I hate being confronted with a page of headings that\
      \ go \"Basic / Intermediate / Advanced\". How am I supposed to know what the\
      \ site author judges to be \"intermediate\"? I don't need to read the basics\
      \ of subtracting a room to put stuff in for the 19th time. And I don't want\
      \ to swim through an interminable paragraph to find what I'm looking for. I\
      \ prefer a reference page from which I can quickly extract the information I\
      \ need.</p>\n<p>That said, there's a n00b born every minute, or so they say,\
      \ and tutorials are addressed to them, not me. Between the dozen or so major\
      \ tutorial sites, I really didn't think there was much point in starting a new\
      \ one: it would only confuse, I didn't have the time to commit to it, and it\
      \ would end up as just one more site for the tutorial links in forum stickies.</p>\n\
      <p>What changed? The url <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"\
      http://www.wikipedia.com\">http://www.wikipedia.com</a> came up in a Google\
      \ search one day in January 2002. I had a look around, read up on how it worked,\
      \ and why it worked (WhyWikiWorks...), and talked to Mychaeel about it who agreed\
      \ that the idea of running a wiki for Unreal documentation had potential. I\
      \ didn't know at the time that the UDN also runs on a wiki. The other catalyst\
      \ was a member of the BuF Editing forum who had recently announced his intention\
      \ to compile (yet another) help file of tutorials. The sleepy editing community\
      \ woke up a little bit for this one, and it seemed a good time to harness this\
      \ to more productive ends. Yes, I'm ranting. It's my page. If you don't like\
      \ it, go read <a href=\"/Legacy:Actor\" title=\"Legacy:Actor\">Actor</a> or\
      \ something. What's the problem with a huge helpfile, or a list of links? Two\
      \ things: organization and obsolecence. Just the other day I saw a thread on\
      \ the InA editing forum: someone was following a tute and had come a cropper:\
      \ where was the toolbox on the right-hand side of the screen? \"That's in UnrealEd\
      \ 1,\" we all cried. Great, problem solved. But isn't it just <i>silly</i> that\
      \ so many tutorials on the web are still confusing people because they refer\
      \ to the old version? Isn't it silly that it's all scattered all over? Oh dear\
      \ I'm ranting again. Time for more coffee.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other rants can be\

      \ with commented lines with Hyphens. Well, even when I tell the Wiki that I\
      \ want that code written as is (by beginning the line with a whitespace), Wiki\
      \ still parses it as a whitespace, two slashes, and a horizontal rule on the\

      \ but let me preclude it by saying that the em-dash parsing was an excellent\
      \ idea. However, I just want to be sure about something. It will only be parsed\
      \ if there is a space on each side of it, right? After all, the double-hyphen\
      \ is also used as an operator in UnrealScript to decrement a variable, and I\
      \ don't think we need those instances of it to be parsed into em-dashes.\n<dl>\n\
      <dd><i>Tarquin</i> yes. It only replaces \"space hyphen hyphen space\". Actually,\

      \ Hello! I'm new! Prolly the wrong place but how where the UnrealEd console\

      \ the site. I expect the list of console commands was released by Epic at some\
      \ point. It's been posted all over the web in different formats. The one we\

      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> Because it doesn't work (you should have noticed that the\

      \ and because it's not desirable (just press Ctrl+R if you want to refresh the\
      \ page; and who'd leave <a href=\"/Legacy:Recent_Changes\" title=\"Legacy:Recent\
      \ Changes\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Recent Changes</a> open that long in a browser\
      \ window anyway?). – Plus, it was done without any explanation by somebody anonymous.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Wormbo:</b> You should <a href=\"/Legacy:Log_In\" title=\"Legacy:Log In\"\
      >log in</a> with your user ID and password or at least set your username on\
      \ the preferences page so others can see that <i>you</i> edited a page.</p>\n\
      <p><b>Mychaeel:</b> ...not that it would have changed anything in <i>this</i>\
      \ case, as explained earlier.</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> tarquin, any idea why <a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Legacy:GRAF1K?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Legacy:GRAF1K\
      \ (page does not exist)\">GRAF1K</a> is displaying the Unreal Wiki logo instead\
      \ of my screenshot I uploaded? It only does that on my computer apparently,\
      \ because Foxpaw and Wormbo can see it perfectly.</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> Weird.\
      \ Try clearing your cache.</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> I did a full reboot and removed\
      \ Mozilla from my system tray. Still no pic. Also, why is my name listed 3x\
      \ under Users Online?</p>\n<p><b>Tarquin:</b> I'm baffled. You get the UW logo\
      \ instead of a graphic if the server thinks you are reading the image embedded\
      \ in another site. Could it be a firewall thing?</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> I am\
      \ going through a firewall, as well as some other hefty security junk. My network\
      \ is run by a web security pro for a bank.&#160;:D</p>\n<p>When I <i>Copy Image\
      \ Location</i> and stick that in the address bar, the picture loads fine. I\
      \ go back to my page, the pic displays properly. But then if I reload the page,\
      \ the pic is gone and there's the stinkin' UW logo again.&#160;:confused: All\
      \ other pictures do the same, but only on Unreal Wiki.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ Sounds like at some point the referrer gets modified. Is that a Mozilla option?</p>\n\
      <p><b>GRAF1K:</b> Actually... I think it happened when I upgraded to 1.4.1!\
      \ That ought to be the problem, anyway.</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> I reinstalled\
      \ Moz. Same problem.&#160;:angry:</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> Went back to 1.3. Fixed.&#160;:D</p>\n\
      <p><b>GRAF1K:</b> There are a LOT of dead personal pages. Should we get rid\
      \ of them? I was thinking of an \"if not online in 90 days, delete\" script\

    text: "Hallo. This is tarquin, also called tarq for short. I tend to prefer lowercase.\
      \ I'm sure there's a reason for it. Aparently there's a UT player who goes by\

      \ or the collective can, or people can volunteer. Another thing I want to do\

      \ signle-player was far less replayable than Quake, but I never tired of Botmatch\
      \ on DM-Loxi. UnrealEd used to crash at the drop of a hat, so it wasn't until\
      \ version 2 that I really started messing around with it. My delvings into the\
      \ class tree got me as far the the class [[Legacy:BrushBuilder|BrushBuilder]],\
      \ which I discovered could be cusomized. I released my pack of brushbuilders\
      \ around February 2001. You can read about them on Russian sites, which I think\
      \ is pretty cool. But then again, small things amuse me, like talking to SpoonDog\
      \ on IRC when it's morning here and, like, whoa dude, night-time there.\n\n\
      It always bugged me that it was so hard to find stuff on UnrealEd. I personally\
      \ hate tutorials. Hmm... so why do I appear to be half-running a site of them?\
      \ Well, more specifically, I hate being confronted with a page of headings that\
      \ go \"Basic / Intermediate / Advanced\". How am I supposed to know what the\
      \ site author judges to be \"intermediate\"? I don't need to read the basics\
      \ of subtracting a room to put stuff in for the 19th time. And I don't want\
      \ to swim through an interminable paragraph to find what I'm looking for.  I\
      \ prefer a reference page from which I can quickly extract the information I\
      \ need.\n\nThat said, there's a n00b born every minute, or so they say, and\
      \ tutorials are addressed to them, not me. Between the dozen or so major tutorial\
      \ sites, I really didn't think there was much point in starting a new one: it\
      \ would only confuse, I didn't have the time to commit to it, and it would end\
      \ up as just one more site for the tutorial links in forum stickies.\n\nWhat\
      \ changed? The url http://www.wikipedia.com came up in a Google search one day\
      \ in January 2002. I had a look around, read up on how it worked, and why it\
      \ worked (WhyWikiWorks...), and talked to Mychaeel about it who agreed that\
      \ the idea of running a wiki for Unreal documentation had potential. I didn't\
      \ know at the time that the UDN also runs on a wiki. The other catalyst was\
      \ a member of the BuF Editing forum who had recently announced his intention\
      \ to compile (yet another) help file of tutorials. The sleepy editing community\
      \ woke up a little bit for this one, and it seemed a good time to harness this\
      \ to more productive ends. Yes, I'm ranting. It's my page. If you don't like\
      \ it, go read [[Legacy:Actor|Actor]] or something. What's the problem with a\
      \ huge helpfile, or a list of links? Two things: organization and obsolecence.\
      \ Just the other day I saw a thread on the InA editing forum: someone was following\
      \ a tute and had come a cropper: where was the toolbox on the right-hand side\
      \ of the screen? \"That's in UnrealEd 1,\" we all cried. Great, problem solved.\
      \ But isn't it just ''silly'' that so many tutorials on the web are still confusing\
      \ people because they refer to the old version? Isn't it silly that it's all\
      \ scattered all over? Oh dear I'm ranting again. Time for more coffee.\n\n*\
      \ Other rants can be found on [[:{{SUBJECTSPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}/Rants]] if\
      \ you're really interested.\n\n----\n\n...and he ought to write something about\
      \ himself here.\n\n: bah... why bother, when I can find such LMAO-worthy gems\
      \ of comedy on the Wiki such as this...  &ndash; ''Tarquin'' \n\n{{innerbox|Actually,\

      \ Epic over to this site.  He wrote back saying to go ahead, and to copy and\
      \ reformat as much as we like.  I'm going to do a few such pages in just a bit.\
      \  I just figured that this was something I should inform you of.\n\n:''Tarquin:''\
      \ That's great!\n\n:''TechnoJF:'' I'm still trying to put Tim Sweeney's UnrealScript\
      \ Language Reference in an acceptable format.  Let me tell you now that this\
      \ thing is a monster to try to work with!\n:: ''Tarquin'': Indeed. The CGI seems\
      \ to choke on it a bit & MacIE crashed halfway through loading it... I've split\
      \ it into subpages.\n\n:''TechnoJF:'' I'm having a slight problem with the markup\
      \ language.  In UScript code, you know that sometimes it is organized and divided\
      \ with commented lines with Hyphens.  Well, even when I tell the Wiki that I\
      \ want that code written as is (by beginning the line with a whitespace), Wiki\
      \ still parses it as a whitespace, two slashes, and a horizontal rule on the\
      \ next line.  Could you make a hack or something so that Wiki will ignore a\
      \ group of hyphens longer than 10?  It would really help me out with this page.\n\
      \n:''Mychaeel:'' Or maybe just such lines that actually solely consist of a\
      \ line of hyphens.  Should be reasonably easy to patch by replacing\n::<code>s/-----+/.../g</code>\n\
      :by\n::<code>s/^\\s*-----+\\s*$/.../gm</code>.\n:Alternatively (as I just found\
      \ out while typing these lines), you can enclose lines of hyphens by <code><</code><code>code></code>...<code><</code><code>/code></code>.\n\
      \n:''TechnoJF:'' Eh, thanks, but the code tags took out all the line breaks\
      \ in that section.  However, I finally managed to get it right with pre and\
      \ /pre tags.\n\n:''Mychaeel:'' I was talking about \"enclosing lines of hyphens\"\
      \ (and not \"enclosing the whole script\") for a reason... http://www.planetjailbreak.com/community/images/emoticons/wink.gif\n\
      ::''TechnoJF:''Oops!  At least I'll remember that for next time.  I used PRE\
      \ tags because I had already seen them at work in the source text for the page.\n\
      :::''Tarquin'' Would the < nowiki > tag do the job?\n\n:''TechnoJF:'' Just a\
      \ quick question, but let me preclude it by saying that the em-dash parsing\
      \ was an excellent idea.  However, I just want to be sure about something. \
      \ It will only be parsed if there is a space on each side of it, right?  After\
      \ all, the double-hyphen is also used as an operator in UnrealScript to decrement\
      \ a variable, and I don't think we need those instances of it to be parsed into\
      \ em-dashes.\n::''Tarquin'' yes. It only replaces \"space hyphen hyphen space\"\
      . Actually, I hadn't considered the decrement operator. oops.\n\n----\n\n:''Note\
      \ from Nuclear Fuzz Grunge'': Tarquin, I've had time to explore the Wiki in\

      \ taking screenshots.  I think I have 18 of a total of 20 that I'll need.  I\
      \ set up a room with no lights and then have been using Pawns and Carcasses\

      \ I'll get me coat. :snigger:\n\n'''Tarquin:''' ermmmmm........ o_O\n\n'''EntropicLqd:'''\
      \  Sorry Tarquin (and Mychaeel).  I don't know where that last comment came\
      \ from &ndash; I appear to have become a little random.  Normal service will\
      \ be resumed after a re-boot.\n\n'''ZxAnPhOrIaN:''' Errr... everybody went INSANE,\
      \ i tell you!!!!!!!!!!!!! <font size=+5><b>INSANE!!!!!!!!!!</b></font>\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ I think what you're seeing, Ent, is a conflict between my fundamental nature\
      \ as a control freak, and my desire to run this wiki in a laid-back manner,\
      \ and let people try whatever they want to. So yup, I'm going loopy like [[Wikipedia:HAL\
      \ 9000]]. :D\n\n'''CH3Z:''' tarquin, you are one patient man. I'm sorry for\
      \ getting psycho on ya (I Need to sleep more). Maybe i need to get back up to\
      \ that lake for a bit.<br />The more i look around here the more impressed i\
      \ am and the more i appreciate you. I'll learn my way around here and make it\
      \ up to ya. Don't know what else i can do. I'm sorry. You deserve a lot more\
      \ respect.<br />I still think yu might have hounded me a bit, (no biggie) but\
      \ i believe the rest was not any kind of deliberate act against me, and what's\
      \ more, was totally your call to make. Thank you for your patience. (even if\
      \ you just dropped it to go to bed =) ) You didn't deserve any of that. \n\n\
      '''Tarquin:''' If you'd arrived on a day other than the Night of A Dozen Vandal\
      \ Edits I probably would have been a bit less stressed... no worries, we're\
      \ cool :D\n\n'''GRAF!K:''' I was wondering... why was my auto-refresh edit on\
      \ RC undone? :confused:\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Because it doesn't work (you should\
      \ have noticed that the <meta> tag had been escaped and was just displayed as\
      \ text in the browser) and because it's not desirable (just press Ctrl+R if\
      \ you want to refresh the page; and who'd leave [[Legacy:Recent Changes|Recent\
      \ Changes]] open that long in a browser window anyway?). &ndash; Plus, it was\
      \ done without any explanation by somebody anonymous.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' You should\
      \ [[Legacy:Log In|log in]] with your user ID and password or at least set your\
      \ username on the preferences page so others can see that ''you'' edited a page.\n\
      \n'''Mychaeel:''' ...not that it would have changed anything in ''this'' case,\
      \ as explained earlier.\n\n'''GRAF1K:''' tarquin, any idea why [[Legacy:GRAF1K|GRAF1K]]\
      \ is displaying the Unreal Wiki logo instead of my screenshot I uploaded? It\
      \ only does that on my computer apparently, because Foxpaw and Wormbo can see\
      \ it perfectly.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Weird. Try clearing your cache.\n\n'''GRAF1K:'''\
      \ I did a full reboot and removed Mozilla from my system tray. Still no pic.\
      \ Also, why is my name listed 3x under Users Online?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I'm baffled.\
      \ You get the UW logo instead of a graphic if the server thinks you are reading\
      \ the image embedded in another site. Could it be a firewall thing?\n\n'''GRAF1K:'''\
      \ I am going through a firewall, as well as some other hefty security junk.\
      \ My network is run by a web security pro for a bank. :D\n\nWhen I ''Copy Image\
      \ Location'' and stick that in the address bar, the picture loads fine. I go\
      \ back to my page, the pic displays properly. But then if I reload the page,\
      \ the pic is gone and there's the stinkin' UW logo again. :confused: All other\
      \ pictures do the same, but only on Unreal Wiki.\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Sounds like\
      \ at some point the referrer gets modified. Is that a Mozilla option?\n\n'''GRAF1K:'''\
      \ Actually... I think it happened when I upgraded to 1.4.1! That ought to be\
      \ the problem, anyway.\n\n'''GRAF1K:''' I reinstalled Moz. Same problem. :angry:\n\
      \n'''GRAF1K:''' Went back to 1.3. Fixed. :D\n\n'''GRAF1K:''' There are a LOT\
      \ of dead personal pages. Should we get rid of them? I was thinking of an \"\
      if not online in 90 days, delete\" script like for MSN accounts. Look at [[:Category:Legacy\
      \ Personal Page]]\n\n'''Wormbo:''' Only those that only contain a welcome and\
      \ no reply from the \"owner\" should be deleted, if any at all.\n\n'''GRAF1K:'''\
      \ Why do you think that?\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Unreal Wiki's embedded images are\
      \ only meant to be displayed in pages on wiki.beyondunreal.com.  Any other refer[r]rers\
      \ (like www.unrealwiki.com, with the exception of referrers which are left entirely\
      \ blank) return only the Unreal Wiki logo. &ndash; I'll look into adding www.unrealwiki.com\
      \ to the list of allowed referrers.  (Why is this discussion here and not on\
      \ [[Legacy:Project Discussion|Project Discussion]]?)\n\n'''GRAF1K:''' Wow...\
      \ thanks tarquin! That -nogamma trick will help everyone. :tup:\n\n'''GRAF1K:'''\
      \ Hey tarq. I sent you an e-mail, but just found the note on the top of this\
      \ page. Anyway, I found a few typos on http://www.planetjailbreak.com/features/codedesign200x/\n\
      \n\"Mychaeel had this to say '''aboutearly''' progress\"\n\n\"This is a considerable\
      \ blessing to mappers, who under UT Jailbreak had to work with different classes\
      \ and settings just to '''these up'''.\" The boldface begins at the point at\
      \ which the sentence ceases to make sense.\n\n\"after all, it's the same architecture\
      \ Epic's mutator system\"\n\nSame architechture '''as''' would be the revision\
      \ here.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Thanks! :)\n\n'''joe:''' Thanks for your chongqing\
      \ support.  I just added a link to your chongqing page to my blog.  I always\
      \ like to check out where spammers hit, do you have some example pages at Css-discuss\
      \ your latest submission hit?  So far he seems small time, but its easier to\
      \ convince them to stop before they are a really big spammer.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ He spammed the front page a few times [http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=FrontPage&version=502].\
      \ Like you say, small time. Css-discuss seems to have been hit by a wide variety\
      \ of spammers, but no single major attack. Thanks for the link; feel free to\
      \ add links to [[Legacy:Chongqing Page|Chongqing Page]].\n\n'''Dark Ryder:'''\
      \ (Sorry if this is the wrong place to report, but since the front page is edit-locked,\
      \ I couldn't think of any other place...)  Broken link on the front page: \"\
      Bot Navigation]]\" -> \"Bot Navigation\" ('''SuperApe:''' Which is now [[Legacy:Bot\
      \ Support|Bot Support]]. ;) )\n\n'''GRAF1K:''' You can edit it yourself on [[Legacy:Home\
      \ Page/Changes|Home Page/Changes]].\n\n'''Dark Ryder:''' Neat; thanks for the\
      \ tip.  How often does it get synched with the [[Legacy:Home Page|Home Page]]?\
      \  (Since it doesn't seem to be \"live\".)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' It's synched when\
      \ an admin spots someone has edited it :)\n\n'''Dark Ryder:''' Ah-ha!  Verrry\
      \ tricky.  ;-)\n\n'''SavannahLion:''' I know it's been a while Tarquin, but\
      \ I hope that you remember me. I'd like to have a short and quick talk with\
      \ you as soon as possible. I'll check back here once in a while, or you can\
      \ drop by my home form at [http://www.forumplanet.com/planethalflife/user.asp?gid=6020489&mid=308830\
      \ Planet Half-Life Forums]. I've got some pretty crucial questions that I think\
      \ you've solved.\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Oh dear... I hope it's not about quaternions,\
      \ as I've forgotten most of what I did with them... but ask anyway :)\n\n'''SavannahLion:'''\
      \ And I just realized that you've given me the answer.  :) I knew you've encountered\
      \ the same problem I have. Even better what four hours of sleep after an emergency\
      \ patch to my Wiki solves. I hate sounding stupid, but I'd prefer not to have\
      \ an public discussion on here. I did, however, explain a little bit of my plight\
      \ on the Chongqing Page.\n\n'''Ghost3021:'''  hey, neet brush builders! and\
      \ they dont suffer from the ued goblin! no matter what you do to them! :D\n\n\
      '''Copperman:''' Had an idea for a BB Tarq. How about the inverse of the Cylinder\
      \ Builder to make something like this: http://img113.exs.cx/img113/4426/inversecylinder.jpg\
      \ allowing similar options to your Cylinder :D Would be good for making round\
      \ corners etc. Intersecting makes them badly so please Just one more new BB.\
      \ :D\n\n'''Tarquin:''' I think I was working on something like that... sadly,\
      \ other commitments mean that the work in progress is just sitting on my HD\
      \ :( I will one day wrap it up!\n\n'''Copperman:''' Hope to see it one day (soon).\
      \ ;)\n\n----\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Hey tarq, I just deleted some sort of hentai\
      \ porno pictures from the Image Uploads.  I don't know who put them there, but\
      \ I didn't think they were appropriate at all.  Just FYI.\n\n'''Tarquin:'''\
      \ Thanks :)\n\n'''MythOpus:'''No problem :)  Mind if I clear out all the porno\
      \ pics and signatures and all those that don't have a place, or a use for the\
      \ wiki?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' heck no! Go for it!!! :D\n\n'''MythOpus:''' I've deleted\
      \ quite a few already... and I've found a new respect for you and the rest of\
      \ the hard working admins everywhere.  Gee Whiz...  Maybe we should put a pic\
      \ sticker on top of the image uploading page that says THIS IS NOT AN IMAGE\
      \ HOSTING SITE or something. Heh, seriously.  I was just wondering if there\
      \ was a way to currently delete a lot of pictures at once.. it's very time consuming\
      \ to click on 'Show management Controls' and then find the pick, click delete\
      \ and do that all over again.  :S ?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Speak to Mychaeel about\
      \ it. We didn't anticipate this many images I think! It won't work as an image\
      \ hosting system, as it checks the referrer. Offsite use of our images just\
      \ produces the logo, but I guess people try at least one image before they get\
      \ wise to that.\n\n'''Mychaeel:''' Well, it ''does'' say \"Remote linking of\
      \ images is forbidden and doesn't work.\"  Of course, people don't read.  If\
      \ somebody has a better idea &ndash; perhaps even just putting this text in\
      \ red might help &ndash; sound up...\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Wouldn't the remotelinking\
      \ of images still work as effective 'spam'?  I don't really understand what\
      \ I said myself, but I remember deleting (I haven't gone through all the images\
      \ yet heh) a nike shoe, probably from a previous spammer. :S  Personally, I\
      \ don't think many of them care about what it says about remote linking.  They\
      \ could be just trying to ruin the rep of the wiki or something :S\n\n'''Blip2:'''\
      \ Can I get a copy of the wiki script yet?\n\n'''Tarquin:''' hard drive still\
      \ dead. ask Mych.\n\n----\n\n'''MythOpus:''' Good Show Tarquin!  Nice job fixing\
      \ the search :)\n\n'''Tarquin:''' Sorry it took so long. BU's FTP access is\
      \ fuxx0red since they moved server.\n\n'''Defx:''' you are too slow to greet\
      \ newcomers lol just kidding\n\n'''Graphik:''' O_o\n\n----\n\n'''Kartoshka:'''\
      \ Sorry about the markup page...it definitely was accidental. I was working\
      \ on refactoring the page and my computer decided to lock up as I was submitting\
      \ some changes. Somehow that  must've trashed the page...again, sorry :/\n\n\
      '''Tarquin:''' No worries :) But I simply reverted to the version before any\
      \ of your edits, so you might want to have another go at whatever you were doing\
      \ :)\n\n'''Kartoshka:''' I gave it another shot...looks OK this time :) PS -\

      \n'''Unreal3''' I am Korean user. http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/unreal_engine_versions\
