      \ people in the gaming comunity ( I say <b>Gaming</b> comunity becasue I haven't\
      \ noticed behaviour like this offline&#160;;) ) people have become, lazy, imature,\
      \ ignorant and full of disrespect. I don't know why this is, nor do I care for\
      \ the reason. All I care about is trying to change it. Here is an example, from\
      \ the Atari Forum.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>&lt;Person 1&gt;:\
      \ I am having trouble with my secondary fire mode. I have tried everthing to\
      \ make it work but I just can't seem to get it to compile.</p>\n<p>&lt;Person\
      \ 2&gt;: Person 1, you should consider finding some documentation oon the subject\
      \ of UScript or get ahole of the source code of whatever game your making the\
      \ secondary fire for. If you still can't figure out the problem, post the code\
      \ that is giving you a hard time.</p>\n<p>&lt;Person 1&gt;: Do you have any\
      \ f****** Idea who I am? I have worked for years with the code from Deus Ex!\
      \ Do you know how f***** hard it is to work with? Documentation is so hard to\
      \ find!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have lost the actual link to the actal thread\
      \ so this isn't exactly what was posted. \" Person 1 \" first posted the question\
      \ in a way that said \" Hi. I'm a newbie. Please help.\" I would have responded\
      \ in close resemblance to how \" Person 2 \" replied. Person 2 was trying to\
      \ help Person 1 by giving him suggestions on how to solve his problem on his\
      \ own. Why would someone blow up on someone who is trying to help like that?</p>\n\
      <p>Here is another example:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>&lt;Player\
      \ 1&gt;: How do you guys shoot so good. Headshots everywhere!</p>\n<p>&lt;Player\
      \ 2&gt;: OMG you newbie! STFU!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An innocent question from\
      \ a new player followed by a response from an experienced player. So what if\
      \ Player 1 is a newbie? Why do you have to put him down? Weren't we all newbie's\
      \ at one time in our lives? First time playing a game. First time programming.\
      \ Instead of helping out Player 1 out, people just yell, swear and critisize\
      \ him. IMO, that's the stupidest thing that you can ever do. A little known\
      \ fact: Helping people is a <b>GOOD</b> thing. Why not teach him that in counter-strike,\
      \ you shouldn't \" Spray and Pray \" as most call it, but you should fire in\
      \ spurts. In UT2003, tell them to practice a lot with their favorite weapon.\
      \ It's not that hard to go out of your way to help someone.</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b>\
      \ Yo Myth Man. Long time no see.&#160;:)</p>\n<p>It seems everyone everywhere\
      \ agrees whith what you're saying. As soon as you join an online game, or look\
      \ at a non-let's-all-debate-why-everyone's-a-jerk thread though, the reality\
      \ sets in. Where have all the sensible people gone? Still debating this problem\
      \ on BuF?&#160;:D</p>\n<p>Really though, everyone debates this and no one actually\
      \ looks for a solution. So here's your solution: Live by what you just said,\
      \ and encourage others to follow. Don't rant about it in forums, tell people\
      \ ingame. I'm not saying it'll work miracles, but in my experience it calms\
      \ stuff down.</p>\n<p><b>MythOpus:</b> I have been looking for a miracle for\
      \ some time now. I haven't found it&#160;:( And yes, long time no see! How is\
      \ Laser War doing?</p>\n<p><b>GRAF1K:</b> LaserWar is completely different.&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p>I'm using most weapons now instead of modified shock rifle, cause it's not\
      \ a \"conventional\" laser tag, more futuristic. Weapons like the Flak I've\
      \ modified the projectiles of to be mini eletric laser balls, etc. My goal in\
      \ LaserWar was never to alter gameplay, but to make UT2003 non-violent and fun-and-happy-like.&#160;:cheesy:</p>\n\
      <p>When depowered I've got that uber-1337 (:rolleyes:) effect-spawning thingy\
      \ in place (remember, the thing we couldn't figure out but Foxpaw showed us&#160;;)),\
      \ as well as spawning a large battery that serves as 10+ health and points.</p>\n\
      <p>So in other words, coming along nicely.&#160;:)</p>\n\n<!-- \nNewPP limit\
