      \ I was working on amidst scrubbing of this computer and installing a newer\
      \ version of Windows. With a little work on the jails I think it could've been\
      \ pretty ready to go, although if I went back now I'd probably scrub half the\
      \ Geometry and redo it&#160;;). In short, no release coming, I'm gonna leave\
      \ this here though, as it might conceivably have some value as a journal, even\
      \ though I can't see what&#160;;).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>First off, where I\
      \ began. The original concept here was a platform in the middle of space, and\
      \ I thought it looked cool to have little diagonal beams coming off the sides\
      \ up to two platforms on either side of it. I'm not sure I explained that very\
      \ well. Anyways, it all started with one simple little set of maybe a dozen\
      \ brushes that I like the look of. This is basically how all of my maps get\
      \ started, imo it's part of the reason they aren't all that great. My recommendation\
      \ is to start with an overall plan, like I did with JB-Nharwax. I really liked\
      \ the way that turned out, certainly my best work yet, but it suffered from\
      \ many many pathnoding bugs which I will probably redesign small sections of\
      \ the level around to accomodate.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Ok, once I had something\
      \ I liked and decide to expand upon, I played around with different ways to\
      \ connect the main platforms with some other ones above that. I originally based\
      \ the next part of the design on those umbrella fountains outside of pools which\
      \ probably don't even exist anymore&#160;;-). Basically, I was going to make\
      \ a large pillar with a platform on top, with a series of cannons on the bottom\
      \ to spray fire at opponents trying to make their way through the middle area.\
      \ I eventually discarded this as profoundly too hard to handle, especially in\
      \ a JB map where it doesn't just slow a player down, it literally ends their\
      \ game for up to several minutes if the cannons get lucky.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>Eventually, I got a system of walkways and platforms leading up to a final\
      \ middle-upper platform that I decided would be the entrance to the base. I\
      \ then faced the problem that stalled my last couple attempts at space maps:\
      \ How to make the base. The problem is, you can't simply make blocks and \"\
      dig\" through them, because the player can see the outside of the base, and\
      \ tunneling through the side of the skybox would look so extremely weird that\
      \ its just not plausible. I've already seen two fixes:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>this\
      \ one is ala CTF-Face: Make a cool outside shape like a pyramid or something\
      \ and tunnel into that.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The other option is kind of the\
      \ lazy man's way out: Just plop a teleporter/warpgate type device at one end\
      \ and make it come out inside a facility: bizarre and patently avoiding the\
      \ issue. I decided that I would try a totally different approach:</li>\n</ol>\n\
      <ol>\n<li>I just made a gargantuan wall, with a nice little \"kink\". (a sloped\
      \ part in the middle right above the playing area with walls going up from either\
      \ end, you'll get all this I hope in the pic I'll provide at some point). Then,\
      \ I tunneled into and \"behind\" the wall. (The wall hides the fact that the\
      \ interior base is carved out of space \"behind\" the fake backdrop).</li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ul>\n<li>I then proceeded to create a rough outline of the base, which\
      \ is basically centered around a central cylinder \"release switch room\". I\
      \ added a glass window between the entrance and the cylinder, with paths leading\
      \ from the entry around behind and up over the cylinder. There are also a couple\
      \ transporters at the back that take you up to sniping platforms up high on\
      \ the wall. I decided one upper approach I made was way too easy to release\
      \ from, because you could just drop onto the switch ala JB-Raid, which is an\
      \ excellent map, way beyond my capabilities, but really suffered from not plugging\
      \ up the entrance right over the flag base.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I decided\
      \ upon what to me was a novel solution to this problem: I created blocks and\
      \ added them flush to the surrounding wall and ceiling, and closed off the upper\
      \ passage. This way, if I ever convert it to CTF I can just delete two brushes\
      \ and the easy-in, not-so-easy-out route through the ceiling is functional again.\
      \ I think you'll see where it used to go if you ride the lift up at the entrance\
      \ to each base, it's kind of obvious the path used to branch both ways, but\
      \ it works decently I think.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I then added some cool \"\
      laser-like\" effects on the sides of the gargantuan wall to give it some flavor.\
      \ I ended up reworking the texture I used into bright red and blue to make navigation\
      \ really really easy in the middle. Then, I put some decorations in the skybox\
      \ and made it rotate. I like the effect of it as a large space station rotating\
      \ to produce gravity (never mind that it wouldn't actually produce gravity but\
      \ bah, it looks cool&#160;:-).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Just today I added in\
      \ the jails, with neat-looking laser-doors, some nice screens, and a little\
      \ \"chatting bay\" (which I'll make a masked texture label for tomorrow probably),\
      \ which makes the ScreenSlidePageChat screen less likely to be \"talked into\"\
      \ inadvertently. I then finished up with some trim on the interior room of the\
      \ base, a platform, and a laser-trip like release switch which I may have to\
      \ tweak a bit to look less tacky.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>My last bit today was\
      \ playing around with the screens aligning them right and talking to SpoonDog\
      \ on #utjb from inside my map.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, that's what I have so far,\
      \ I'll keep writing as it comes, and get a couple pics up at some point to illustrate\
      \ a couple key things I said.</p>\n<p>My apologies for the extra-fuzzy pics,\
      \ they were really beautiful until I overdid trying to make the file size smaller&#160;:-\\\
