      \ can see on the right, I've updated one of the pics to show visually what I'm\
      \ doing to the map. Basically, I cut roughly half the lights from the map (probably\
      \ a bit more actually), and changed the remaining lights in each base to be\
      \ team-colored. I then filled up a lot of the empty visual space in each base\
      \ with girders and trim around all the edges, which makes each room feel much\
      \ more full and complete to me. I'm very happy so far with how the map looks,\
      \ except for the center area, which I think still looks a little bland (but\
      \ not nearly as bland as before I took all those lights out). Anyways, I'm finishing\
      \ up the touches and should be ready to release a second beta version soon.</li>\n\
      </ul>\n<ul>\n<li>June 15, 2003 - Another update today, I posted up a \"beta\"\
      \ version of the map to the core dev forums, and got back some good feedback\
      \ from SpoonDog about things I should try to spruce up the map's looks a bit.\
      \ I finally got around to downloading the DDS plugin for Photoshop from NVidia,\
      \ and that was a very good thing to do. Combined with my newfound realization\
      \ that you can skin static meshes, I edited the texture on my lightboxes to\
      \ have red and blue tints, so now I can make realistic team lighting (which\
      \ is one of the things Spoon suggested). Also I need to find something for the\
      \ doors, Tahngarth has suggested some sort of wall panel, so maybe I'll take\
      \ another browse through the standard meshes for something nice tomorrow. I\
      \ also went on a light-bashing spree, which has made the map a lot darker and\
      \ a <i>lot</i> cooler looking. I'm feeling pretty good about how the map is\
      \ shaping up, but I've now got a lot more work to do. Luckily, I've got nothing\
      \ else planned for tomorrow&#160;:).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>June 15, 2003 -\
      \ I've added an arena into the map now, but more importantly I've botpathed\
      \ the entire thing. Right now my major concerns are that the bots seem to get\
      \ stuck on my jump pads (I knew it couldn't be <b>that</b> easy&#160;:/), some\
      \ other minor pathing issues, and that the map is very slow FPS-wise with bots\
      \ in it. I'm considering taking out the nice beautiful window in each base and\
      \ replacing it with a large anti-portal, but it adds so much asthetic/tactical\
      \ value to the map that I'm hoping I don't have to do that.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\
      <li>June 14, 2003 - Well, I've got some pics up that, although they're a little\
      \ low-quality, should give some idea of the basic look of the map. I'm going\
      \ to be putting in an arena soon (it will be above the switch room, much as\
      \ the jail is above the foyer). I've also done my first jump pads in UT2003,\
      \ and I can't say enough about how incredibly awesome this is. It takes no work\
      \ at all, you just tell it what path node to target and voila, I was jumping\
      \ up and down in excitement (not literally) for 10 minutes when I first used\
      \ them. From my initial impressions of the in-game scale, I think this map should\
      \ be able to handle 10-16 players, it's quite large, a little larger than I\
      \ thought I was making it before I got in-game.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class=\"\
