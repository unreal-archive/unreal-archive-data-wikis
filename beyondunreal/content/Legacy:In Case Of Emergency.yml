      <p>Of course this is all about backups. Always make sure you do regular backups\
      \ of your work, but most important make sure you have at least one backup on\
      \ a off-site location.</p>\n<p>You have to do it regularly because you don't\
      \ want to be set back a whole month. Often there is a solution available that\
      \ gives you the ability to do incremental backups. This way you can keep smaller\
      \ backups, but make sure you also do a complete backup once in a while because\
      \ there's nothing more anoying that restoring tons of incremental backups.</p>\n\

      <p>When your are working with a team you usually use a <a href=\"/Legacy:Version_Control\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Version Control\">version control</a> system. A nice side effect\
      \ of this is that you will always have a backup of the work on a different location.\
      \ Hint: Even if you are a sole developer a version control system is very useful.</p>\n\
      <p>There is just one thing people sometimes forget and that is that you only\
      \ have the current files on all work stations. You don't have any control information\
      \ or previous version. So also make sure you create backups of the the data\
      \ on the version control server and ship it to a off-site location.</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ can keep your documentation in a CVS too, but this has a little downside that\
      \ discussion about a document can't be included (it's not nice). A Wiki system\
      \ might be the solution, it will also keep a record of changes, and some wiki\
      \ systems can't backed-up just like a Version Control system since they use\
      \ plain text files.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Discussion\">Discussion</span><span\

      <p>Forums are a nice place for discussions, but there's a major downside. It's\
      \ hard to keep backups because you usually don't administer the system running\
      \ the forum. Also most forums use a database, and databases are not really friendly\
      \ when it comes to backing up. It lacks the posibility for incremental backups.</p>\n\
      <p>Mailing lists are very backup friendly, everybody receives a copy of the\
      \ message and of course the mailing list server keeps an archive (usually).</p>\n\

      <p>There's not much use in creating backups and storing them at the same location\
      \ as where the official data is. You have to ship your backups to an off-site\
      \ location.</p>\n<p>So once in a while burn your backups on a CD-ROM and and\
      \ when you visit your parents stash them somewhere on their attic so they won't\
      \ \"clean\" it up (near your old porn stash is usualy a good location).</p>\n\

      <p>An other very important thing is the security of your system. Even though\
      \ you are developing something open source you want to have you workstations\
      \ and backup/version control servers to be secure.</p>\n<p>Before you know it\
      \ somebody hacked his/her way into your system and could change/steal your developments.\
      \ So visit the OS vendor's online update site at least weekly to check if security\
      \ patches have been released. When a patch has been released it usually means\
      \ that an exploit has been availble for a couple of days (with MS Windows often\
      \ a couple of weeks). It's usualy best to turn on any automatic update features,\
      \ or at least configure them to automatically download updates.</p>\n<p>Another\
      \ thing is to install a virus scanner on your MS Windows systems. And install\
      \ or turn on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/firewall\" class=\"\
      extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:firewall\">Wikipedia:firewall</a> on your system.\
      \ But even better than turning on a firewall is to disable all useless services\
      \ running on your system. The Microsoft Windows NT product line (NT, 2000, XP,\
      \ ...) come with a lot of useless services enabled. Usually you can disable\
      \ most of them. If you don't know what a services does and you can't find much\
      \ information about it just disable it and check if everything is still working\
      \ as it should (the good old trial and error). See <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external text\" href=\"http://www.tweakhound.com/xp/security/page_1.htm\">Securing\
      \ Windows XP</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.tweakhound.com/xp/xptweaks/supertweaks6.htm\"\
      >Disabling Unnecessary Proceses</a>. for XP machines.</p>\n<p>When you already\
      \ have a backend network it's a good idea to install a secure router. A secure\
      \ router can be very easy to install. All you need it an old PC (pentium will\
      \ do fine) with two quality network interface cards (3com or intel NICs advised)\
      \ and install <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.netbsd.org\"\
      >NetBSD</a> on that old machine. You don't need a state of the art machine for\
      \ a simple router. NetBSD is a very secure operating system (hasn't had a remote\
      \ root exploit in quite some years), it might take some time to get it installed\
      \ correctly, but there's usualy enough information and support available. Because\
      \ you have a router between the internet and your backend network your backend\
      \ network will automatically be secure from external attacks because they first\
      \ have to go through your router to reach your network.</p>\n<p>It's better\
      \ to use an old PC with NetBSD (or any other small UNIX like OS will do) than\
      \ to use a hardware router. Simply because the cost of a PC router is pretty\
      \ low, and you will have total freedom over it's features and settings.</p>\n\
