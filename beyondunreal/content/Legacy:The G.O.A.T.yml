      \ the fun of it. I've mapped for games like DOOM II, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake 2\
      \ but also Starcraft, Warcraft,...</p>\n<p>When Unreal first came out I was\
      \ simply blown away by the graphical power of the engine. They had colored lighting\
      \ in Software-mode and texture filtering when you had a processor with MMX technology.</p>\n\
      <p>Then I discovered that this game came with an editor. So I started messing\
      \ around in it. It took me quite some time to learn the basics. Back in the\
      \ days I didn't even had a decent internet connection, so online tutorials were\
      \ unknown to me. Also the version that came with Unreal was quite buggy so after\
      \ a time I stopped working with it.</p>\n<p>After that, Unreal Tournament came\
      \ out and again it came with the UnrealEditor. But this was still the old and\
      \ buggy UnrealEditor 1, so I didn't do much in it. But then came UnrealEditor\
      \ 2. It was included in the patches and it was a totally revamped editor, written\
      \ from the ground up. This version was way more stable and contained much less\
      \ bugs. So I started working more and more in this editor. It is also in this\
      \ editor that I made all of the levels for Unreal Tournament which I have released.</p>\n\
      <p>More recently I worked a bit in SeriousEditor which was the leveleditor that\
      \ came with Serious Sam: The First Encounter and Serious Sam: The Second Encounter.\
      \ I learned how to do all the basics and I must say that it is one hell of a\
      \ good engine. I didn't make any complete levels in it however, because the\
      \ way terrain is done is not very user-friendly in my opinion. Also I found\
      \ the editor somewhat confusing, although that might be because I was so used\
      \ to working with UnrealEditor.</p>\n<p>Then some months ago Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003 was released. It came with a new UnrealEditor, namely version 3.0. This\
      \ new engine/editor included a lot of new features such as Terrain, Matinee,\
      \ Materials,...</p>\n<p>So, now I mostly work in UnrealEditor 3.0.</p>\n<h2><span\
