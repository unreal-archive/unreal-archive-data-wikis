      \ point out that this can be significantly higher. I personally wouldn't bother\
      \ doing a skin less than 1024x1024 unless you just feel uncomfortable working\
      \ that large. The UT2k3 skins are actually 2 1024x1024 textures. One body, and\
      \ one for the head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n\
      <p>Two ery important things to keep in mind here though are that using textures\
      \ at that size require selecting \"DXT1\" compression when importing a TGA into\
      \ the texture browser. Here's the rub... DXT1 does not allow for an alpha channel,\
      \ therefore you would have to be very clever indeed about applying shaders to\
      \ such a character. If you have an alpha channel in a skin, it should come in\
      \ at DXT5 compression, which is obviously much larger, and I would definitely\
      \ NOT recommend bringing in a bunch of 1024x1024s at DXT5. One is debatable.</p>\n\
      </blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>Also, the way the engine\
      \ handles state changes, it's better to have one larger texture than several\
      \ smaller ones. Don't pile 3 256x256 textures on a model, it would be much more\
      \ efficient to just do a single 1024 and get some bonus resolution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
      <blockquote class=\"legacyquote\">\n<p>Anyway, this isn't any kind of official\
      \ information , just letting you know that if I were personally making character\
      \ mods, I wouldn't bother working below 3000 polys or below a 1024x1024 texture,\
