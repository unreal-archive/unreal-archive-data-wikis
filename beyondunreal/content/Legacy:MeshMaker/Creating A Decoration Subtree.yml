      Legacy:Decoration\">decorations</a> created with <a href=\"/Legacy:MeshMaker\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:MeshMaker\">MeshMaker</a> in a single .u file, with a bit of\
      \ manual help you can also have them appear in their own subtree in the class\

      \ below <a href=\"/Legacy:UT_Decoration\" title=\"Legacy:UT Decoration\">UT_Decoration</a>).</p>\n\
      <p>For the purpose of this... tutorial, I'll assume that your decoration package\
      \ file is called MychDecoPack.u and that you want your decorations to appear\
      \ in a subtree called <code>MychDeco</code>. (Just substitute those terms where\
      \ they occur with your own.)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Browse to your <a href=\"/Legacy:Engine_Directory_Structure\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:Engine Directory Structure\">UnrealTournament directory</a>.\
      \ You'll find a directory called \"MychDecoPack\" there. In that directory,\
      \ there's a subdirectory called \"Classes\". Open it. This \"Classes\" directory\
      \ contains a bunch of .uc files; each of those files corresponds to a decoration\
      \ you converted (you'll recognize the file names as the names you gave your\
      \ individual decorations).</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new file in that\
      \ directory, called MychDeco.uc, that contains the following code:\n<div dir=\"\
      ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\"\
      >\n<pre class=\"de1\"><span class=\"kw1\">class</span> MychDeco <span class=\"\
      kw1\">extends</span> Decoration;</pre></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Open\
      \ <b>every single</b> of the other .uc files and substitute the expression \"\
      <code>extends Decoration</code>\" somewhere near the top of the file by \"<code>extends\
      \ MychDeco</code>\". The result could look somewhat like this:\n<div dir=\"\
      ltr\" class=\"mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr\">\n<div class=\"uscript source-uscript\"\
      >\n<pre class=\"de1\"><span class=\"kw1\">class</span> MychCupOfCoffee <span\
      \ class=\"kw1\">extends</span> MychDeco;</pre></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\
      <p>Now what's left to do is to recompile the decoration package. Don't worry,\
      \ it's just as easy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <a href=\"/Legacy:UnrealTournament.Ini\"\
      \ title=\"Legacy:UnrealTournament.Ini\">UnrealTournament.ini</a> and find a\
      \ couple of lines starting with the term \"EditPackages\". Add another line\
      \ for your package (leave the .u off):\n<pre>  EditPackages=MychDecoPack</pre></li>\n\
      </ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your UnrealTournament\\System directory and delete (yes,\
      \ delete) the old MychDecoPack.u.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <i>Run</i>\
      \ dialog box (from the <i>Start</i> menu) and click the <i>Browse</i> button.\
      \ Browse to your UnrealTournament\\System directory and find a program called\
      \ \"ucc\". Click <i>Open</i>.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Back in the <i>Run</i>\
      \ dialog box (you didn't click <i>OK</i> there yet), append the string \"make\"\
      \ to the command line (separated by a blank). Now, click <i>OK</i>. A console\
      \ window opens, and you'll see all of your EditPackages being processed, and\
      \ your own decoration package too.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If everything works out,\
      \ you'll find a new MychDecoPack.u in your UnrealTournament\\System directory.</p>\n\
