      \ new \"hardware brushes\" I fear the demand for a tool like MeshMaker will\
      \ rapidly decrease... but if there is any, I'll certainly consider it.</p>\n\
      <p><b>UsAaR33:</b> Hmm.. I'd imagine demand skyrocketing. Hardware brushes must\
      \ be used for movers after all. And with Epic's lack of support for Gmax (AFAIK),\
      \ this leaves those without $1000+ to buy software (and with morals+) in the\
      \ dark. Meshmaker could allow for easy creation of hardware brushes... just\
      \ make something in ued... and it could become a hardware brush..</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b>\
      \ As far as I know that functionality is already built into the new UnrealEd;\
      \ from what I heard it's possible to create hardware brushes directly from the\
      \ <a href=\"/Legacy:Red_Builder_Brush\" title=\"Legacy:Red Builder Brush\">red\
      \ builder brush</a> and also convert static meshes back to BSP.</p>\n<hr />\n\
      <p><b>UsAaR33:</b> Just wondering... how hard was meshmaker to code? I imagine\
      \ the skin mapping being the hardest...</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> The algorithm\
      \ that \"corrects\" texture alignment when people try to do stuff that just\
      \ won't work on meshes (tiling textures, for instance) was the trickiest part.\
      \ Designing the interface to be as easy to use as possible took most of the\
      \ time though...</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Torn_Agressor:</b> might not be a directly\
      \ related question to meshmaker, but if i wanted to get the meshes into MyLevel\
      \ how would i do this?..</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> That's described on the <a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.planetunreal.com/screen/meshmaker/\"\
      >MeshMaker homepage</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>King Mango:</b>When creating a prefab\
      \ in UED2, I aligned all the textures as I wanted, rebuilt the level exported\
      \ the brush and ran it through mesh maker. When I placed it in my level, the\
      \ textures had all been unaligned. I tried several times to correct this to\
      \ no avail...</p>\n<p><b>Mychaeel:</b> It is technically impossible to \"tile\"\
      \ textures on a mesh whereas it's very possible (and common) to do that on brush\
      \ surfaces. When a texture is \"tiled\" on a brush surface, MeshMaker adjusts\
      \ its alignment to meet those requirements.</p>\n<p>Technical background: Texture\
      \ alignment on a <i>brush surface</i> is defined by a texel origin for one of\
      \ its corners and two vectors which specify orientation and scale; texture alignment\
      \ on a <i>mesh triangle</i> is defined by simply a set of texel coordinates\
      \ for each of the triangle's three corners.</p>\n<p><b>SabbathCat:</b> Hi Mychaeel,\
      \ I've been trying to line up a texture on a \"Cross\" shaped mesh, I'd made\
      \ a custom skin, and tried several ways of aligning it, but it always goes off,\
      \ despite the texture being aligned to the corner. Is it possible to play with\
      \ the texture alignment from withi the .3d file, or in the t3d before compiling?\
      \ The texture itself is big enough that it shouldn't tile, it's set-up so it\
      \ should in theory align perfectly when \"aligned to floor\".</p>\n<hr />\n\
      <p><b>papercoffee:</b> I didn't use MM till now... but... First- is this wiki\
      \ section still active? Second- how do you manage the collision radius of a\
      \ mesh build with the mesh-maker??</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b> You don't. MeshMaker\
      \ makes best effort to match the collision cylinder to the mesh. If you need\
      \ a different collision size you need to modify it in the .uc file or later\
      \ after placing the converted mesh.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><b>Gustavo6046:</b> I made\
      \ my TazerBox prefab textured well, but when I ran MeshMaker the resulting mesh\
      \ had \"viewport icon\" textures. And nonetheless invisible in world.</p>\n\
