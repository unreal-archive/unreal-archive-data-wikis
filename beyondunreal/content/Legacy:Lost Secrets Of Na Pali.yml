      <p>Around 200 years are gone since the Queen is dead. A lot of things happened.\
      \ Na Pali was conquered by Earth Forces, the Mercenaries operate far more open\
      \ and the Skaarj Empire has been to quite for the last decades... Well since\
      \ a few years the UMS sets up big bases and outposts on Na Pali and support\
      \ the Nali with technology and weapons. The Skaarj Empire is forced to find\
      \ any way to finally beat mankind back, first back from Na Pali, and get control\
      \ back of control of Na Pali. Over some decades they developed a way to grow\
      \ Pupae half biologically half synthetically. Through this abnormal progress\
      \ they are able to grow mutated Skaarjs with extraordinary Gen-Pool. These special\
      \ Skaarjs are \"produced\" only for one reason: to destroy Mankind and the Nalis\
      \ in using two ways: Invading on the one hand the Earth AND Na Pali with the\
      \ new Skaarj-Mutants and on the other hand... in a different time. The Empire\
      \ developed during many years of researching a Time-Vortex-Machine that causes\
      \ a controlled black-hole with enough anti-matter to transform gravity and therefor\
      \ a Time Portal.</p>\n<p>First simulations with the Vortex were successful.\
      \ Not much time passed until the Skaarj were using the Vortex in real space.\
      \ They send a small fleet somewhere near (a few lightyears away) Na Pali. The\
      \ vortex seemed to work... but suddenly the forming of the black-hole got out\
      \ of control. A Time-Anomaly was forming and the fleet was destroyed. Both,\
      \ the UMS(now you do come into game, you're a Major of the UMS on an Earth Force\
      \ Ship) and the Skaarjs are sending control troops to the accidental place.\
      \ Such a huge visible anomaly and the wrecks won't be unseen for long time.\
      \ When the ships were arriving the Skaarj Ship starts to attack the UMS ship\
      \ immediately... suddenly the the Anomaly seemed to colapse... but a strange\
      \ kind of starship appears using unknown technology and weapons ... The ship\
      \ is about to attack both ships instantly. You and one you soldier escape from\
      \ your ship flying down to Na Pali. You see your ship exploding... After crashing\
      \ into a forest you continue your journey by searching the closest UMS Outpost.\
      \ On you short way through some villages you read about a prophecy called \"\
      The End of Everything\" in an old Nali book. Is there a connection between the\
      \ anomaly and the prophecy&#160;? The Skaarj wont spend much time until they\
      \ come back with a fleet to get at least Na Pali. But they're more open questions,\
      \ why did the Vortex got out of control&#160;? What role does the unknown species\
      \ play&#160;? Why is the UMS Coop. so interested in Na Pali&#160;? What is your\
      \ role in the plot&#160;? How does Na Pali look now, 200 years after the events\
      \ of UNREAL...</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Features\">Features</span><span\
