      <p><b>Tarquin:</b> My typing is atrocious, so the fewer letter, the less chance\

      \ an impulse to respond as quickly as possible. I will cheerfully admit that\
      \ my first few maps were atrocious. I was way too ambitious, and yes, I too\
      \ had ideas of \"pushing the engine\", \"doing something <b>big</b>\", etc.\
      \ My advice to beginner mappers is along the same lines as DavidM's: don't try\
      \ to be wildly original. Focus on technique. Don't try anything fancy: stick\
      \ to the basic UT <a href=\"/Legacy:Texture_Package\" title=\"Legacy:Texture\

      \ don't use them. Stick to geometry and (unfortunately) bot pathing.</p>\n<p><b>Wormbo:</b>\
      \ Same goes for coding. Don't try to make a huge TC, start small with mutators.\

      \ for new mods. It would be stupid to trash all the work right before finishing\
      \ the mod you put most of your coding time into.</p>\n<p><b>Eldhrin:</b> Mutators\
      \ are a great place to start, I'm liking coding them lots. Probably too ambitious\
      \ on Sorcery, but I don't have any other real ideas right now. Maybe if I can\
      \ find out how to make a new keybinding, I can come up with some interesting\
      \ ones that add new abilities or something. Or maybe new adrenaline stuff...\
      \ just random thoughts here&#160;:-)</p>\n<p><b>SabbathCat:</b> Heheh. I'll\
      \ admit to a handful of the crimes listed. Yeah, mutators are a great place\
      \ to start, just to play about with source and messing about with changing properties\
      \ to ease your way into the language. Especially if you've no previous experience\
      \ of <a href=\"/Legacy:OOP\" title=\"Legacy:OOP\" class=\"mw-redirect\">OOP</a>.\
      \ From about the age of 10 I was playing with Basic on the Commodore 64, then\
      \ moving onto my Dad's 286 and GWbasic. UnrealScript is a totally different\
      \ beast for anyone coming from a sequential language background. For someone\
      \ starting out in UnrealScript, (as I am re-learning ), It's far more rewarding\
      \ to have a small script you've actually hand-typed yourself than something\
      \ bigger, but that you've simply bashed together from other scripts without\
      \ really understanding or learning anything from what you've done.&#160;:)</p>\n\
      <p><b>Draconx:</b> It's always good to start small - even better to do something\
      \ small that can be extended. My current project (RuneUT) is just a fairly basic\
      \ mutator, but the whole thing can be taken one rune at a time. This is actually\
      \ my first *real* mod for UT, before I just did some fairly basic map actors\
      \ (See: <a href=\"/Legacy:Input_Keys\" title=\"Legacy:Input Keys\">Input Keys</a>\
      \ &amp; <a href=\"/Legacy:Changing_The_Enforcer_(UT)\" title=\"Legacy:Changing\
      \ The Enforcer (UT)\">Changing the Enforcer (UT)</a>). After those and a few\
      \ more, I took on the more ambitious project, which will feature 700 unique\
      \ runes with bot support so good you'll wish you could beat them, as well as\
      \ 30 maps designed exclusively for the mod! (j/k&#160;:wink:)</p>\n<p><b>SuperApe:</b>\
