# Mirrored Wikis

These are (currently) MediaWiki wikis, collected by crawling via their 
publicly available APIs.

Page content is stored in both the HTML rendered and original wikitext 
representations, along with categories, links, sections, and other page
metadata, with each page stored here as a single YAML document. 

All graphics have been mirrored into the `/w/images` directories.
