      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This\
      \ walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n</p><p>You start in the short\
      \ corridor you entered at the end of the previous map, with a door at the end.\
      \ Signs on either side remind you of what you are just leaving [1].\n</p><p>Step\
      \ ahead to the door and look through as it opens.\n</p><p>It is a small seemingly\
      \ empty canyon, but you can hear a <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\">Brute</a>\
      \ growling. Step out and look around - there are two boxes ahead, with an <a\
      \ href=\"/ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a> in front of the\
      \ left one. Collect the ASMD. As you do so you will see the Brute you heard\
      \ growling lurking behind the other box. Kill it. Raid the area for gear - beside\
      \ the entrance you will find a <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a> and ASMD Core to the side that was\
      \ on the left as you emerged. The similar position on the other side has a Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit.\n</p><p>From that side, go forth up the canyon. A wooden crate\
      \ has a box of 50 Bullets, while a UMS drop box has a 50 bullet CAR Clip. Continuing\
      \ up the canyon, you climb a slope and curve round to the right. Mind a <a href=\"\
      /Manta_(enemy)\" title=\"Manta (enemy)\">Manta</a> that swoops down here. The\
      \ canyon opens out a bit further along into an area with a lake, a small tower\
      \ in the water and a large Nali-constructed bridge raised on walls above - I'll\
      \ call said bridge the Crossing. A <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a>Warrior\
      \ is on guard by the lake here, so kill it. Look around.\n</p><p>There's an\
      \ arch through the walls of the crossing. You'll be going through there later.\
      \ First, go to the far corner of the lake's banks and behind the large rock\
      \ there to find a SkaarjScout who was lurking in a potential ambush. Kill it\
      \ then go further round behind the rock for two Nali Healing Fruit and 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards.\n</p><p>Go to the lake in that corner and jump in. In the lake, go\
      \ to the right of the tower foundations and head for the three UMS drop boxes\
      \ on the pool floor. Kill the two <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\"\
      >Devilfish</a> lurking down there then open the boxes for a 50 bullet CAR Clip,\
      \ a box of 10 Grenades (<a href=\"/Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"Grenade Launcher\"\
      >Grenade Launcher</a> ammo), and a useful Grenade Launcher.\n</p><p>Surface\
      \ to recharge your <a href=\"/SCUBA_Gear#Other_Appearances\" title=\"SCUBA Gear\"\
      >Marine SCUBA Gear</a>, then go round to the side of the tower that faces away\
      \ from the Crossing. Underwater you will see a hole in the tower that you can\
      \ enter - go inside and swim up the vertical shaft, surfacing in the candlelit\
      \ room inside the tower base. There's a lift ahead - ride it up to the top into\
      \ a loft with a panoramic view where you can find a useful <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\"\
      \ title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>.\n</p><p>From the loft, plunge off into\
      \ the pool facing such that the crossing is to your right. Ahead underwater\
      \ you will see the mouth of a pipe leading off into the rock to the right. Swim\
      \ to the pipe and enter. Swim along the pipe - as you approach a damaged section\
      \ of the pipe wall, you will meet a Devilfish whom you should kill. Go through\
      \ the broken section of the pipe wall to enter a small cave (kill another Devilfish\
      \ here). Within the cave, surface on a wooden platform. There's a dead Nali\
      \ with a diary [2].\n</p><p>Shoot open containers here to grab an <a href=\"\
      /Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a>,\
      \ then prepare to return to the water. Plunge in and swim back through to the\
      \ pipe. Now... to the right leads to a later part of the level, so go instead\
      \ back to the left. Surface and head to the right to find a plank that you can\
      \ use to get back onto the lake's banks. Time to move on. So, go to the crossing\
      \ and back through the arch. You will emerge in another small uphill canyon;\
      \ go to the left of the large rock here for a box of 50 Bullets. Head on up\
      \ the canyon, but beware the SkaarjScout lurking beyond the rock.\n</p><p>At\
      \ the top of the canyon, you will arrive at another lake where a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ comes bounding across a plank to the left. Kill it. There's a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit on the right if you need it. Ahead in the second lake is a kind of Nali\
      \ gazebo on stilts. So, dive into the lake and head for the base of the gazebo.\
      \ Kill the Devilfish lurking off to the left then take a diversion to go round\
      \ behind the gazebo stilts to read the log of a human corpse you will find there\
      \ [3].\n</p><p>Surface and go to the base of the gazebo. In the centre you will\
      \ find a lift - step on to it and ride it to the top, arriving inside the structure.\
      \ There's a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> there, and the\
      \ containers reveal 40 Tarydium Shards, a Flare and a Nali Fruit Seed. Drop\
      \ back into the water and head for a sloping plank nearby which allows you to\
      \ climb back out to the land by which you entered this area. It might be hard\
      \ to climb on it as it is very small and you will usually just jump over it.\
      \ Attempt to climb out until you actually do.\n</p><p>Go now to the other plank,\
      \ the one the SkaarjWarrior came across. Cross it yourself to reach a rock.\
      \ From there, take another plank across the lake to arrive on the far bank.\
      \ On the bank, head up the following valley to the right, going via an UMS drop\
      \ box containing a 50 bullet CAR Clip. Shortly, you will arrive at a small settlement\
      \ with a Nali hut and a barn, guarded by a SkaarjWarrior. Kill the Skaarj. Go\
      \ towards the hut; a barrow outside has two Nali Healing Fruit inside if you\
      \ need them. Then, enter the hut.\n</p><p>The hut is a typical Nali dwelling.\
      \ Go to the left and onto the table to collect an <a href=\"/Automag\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a> from the hands of a human corpse.\
      \ Read the corpse's log [4].\n</p><p>Crates in the hut contain a Clip and 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards. When you're done, leave the humble home and head round to\
      \ the left, past the barn which contains a <a href=\"/Nali_Cow\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Nali Cow\">Nali Cow</a> and a Nali Calf.\n</p><p>Follow the slope\
      \ of the valley upwards. A large rock on the right has two Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ behind it should you need them. Shortly you will arrive at the top, where\
      \ you will see that the valley continues over the Crossing from here. Start\
      \ across the Crossing. A Krall will see you and run away across the bridge.\
      \ Shoot open barrels here for 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 50 Bullets. Give\
      \ pursuit, shooting open UMS drop boxes on the way for a <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a>\
      \ and a box of 10 Grenades. At the far end, the Krall who ran away will have\
      \ been joined by two others who attack.\n</p><p>At the far end, barrels contain\
      \ a cluster of 40 Tarydium Shards. Watch out here for four <a href=\"/Pack_Hunter\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Pack Hunter\">Pack Hunters</a> lurking on the\
      \ plateau ahead. Then, step on to the platform and look around. Here on this\
      \ plateau are two well entrances. The first is closed off but the second is\
      \ open. Shoot a barrel beyond the first for an ASMD Core and collect of the\
      \ two Nali Healing Fruit behind a rock at the back of the plateau, then jump\
      \ down the open well to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ the second map in [[Unreal - Return to Na Pali|Unreal - Return to Na Pali's]]\
      \ single player game.\n; Author : [[Nivlek]]\n; Description\n: You are well\
      \ and truly back on the planet now. Emerging from Terra-Neo, you arrive at a\
      \ lake and valley crossed by a wide [[Nali]]-constructed bridge. Time to move\
      \ on and explore your new surroundings before night falls.\n{{clear}}\n==Weapons\

      \ - Dead\n* [[Predator]]\n\n\n\n==Walkthrough==\n''This walkthrough was completed\
      \ on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty\
      \ settings.''\n\nYou start in the short corridor you entered at the end of the\
      \ previous map, with a door at the end. Signs on either side remind you of what\
      \ you are just leaving [1].\n\nStep ahead to the door and look through as it\
      \ opens.\n\nIt is a small seemingly empty canyon, but you can hear a [[Brute]]\
      \ growling. Step out and look around - there are two boxes ahead, with an [[ASMD]]\
      \ in front of the left one. Collect the ASMD. As you do so you will see the\
      \ Brute you heard growling lurking behind the other box. Kill it. Raid the area\
      \ for gear - beside the entrance you will find a [[Nali Healing Fruit]] and\
      \ ASMD Core to the side that was on the left as you emerged. The similar position\
      \ on the other side has a Nali Healing Fruit.\n\nFrom that side, go forth up\
      \ the canyon. A wooden crate has a box of 50 Bullets, while a UMS drop box has\
      \ a 50 bullet CAR Clip. Continuing up the canyon, you climb a slope and curve\
      \ round to the right. Mind a [[Manta (enemy)|Manta]] that swoops down here.\
      \ The canyon opens out a bit further along into an area with a lake, a small\
      \ tower in the water and a large Nali-constructed bridge raised on walls above\
      \ - I'll call said bridge the Crossing. A [[Skaarj]]Warrior is on guard by the\
      \ lake here, so kill it. Look around.\n\nThere's an arch through the walls of\
      \ the crossing. You'll be going through there later. First, go to the far corner\
      \ of the lake's banks and behind the large rock there to find a SkaarjScout\
      \ who was lurking in a potential ambush. Kill it then go further round behind\
      \ the rock for two Nali Healing Fruit and 40 Tarydium Shards.\n\nGo to the lake\
      \ in that corner and jump in. In the lake, go to the right of the tower foundations\
      \ and head for the three UMS drop boxes on the pool floor. Kill the two [[Devilfish]]\
      \ lurking down there then open the boxes for a 50 bullet CAR Clip, a box of\
      \ 10 Grenades ([[Grenade Launcher]] ammo), and a useful Grenade Launcher.\n\n\
      Surface to recharge your [[SCUBA Gear#Other_Appearances|Marine SCUBA Gear]],\
      \ then go round to the side of the tower that faces away from the Crossing.\
      \ Underwater you will see a hole in the tower that you can enter - go inside\
      \ and swim up the vertical shaft, surfacing in the candlelit room inside the\
      \ tower base. There's a lift ahead - ride it up to the top into a loft with\
      \ a panoramic view where you can find a useful [[Flak Cannon]].\n\nFrom the\
      \ loft, plunge off into the pool facing such that the crossing is to your right.\
      \ Ahead underwater you will see the mouth of a pipe leading off into the rock\
      \ to the right. Swim to the pipe and enter. Swim along the pipe - as you approach\
      \ a damaged section of the pipe wall, you will meet a Devilfish whom you should\
      \ kill. Go through the broken section of the pipe wall to enter a small cave\
      \ (kill another Devilfish here). Within the cave, surface on a wooden platform.\
      \ There's a dead Nali with a diary [2].\n\nShoot open containers here to grab\
      \ an [[Assault Vest]], then prepare to return to the water. Plunge in and swim\
      \ back through to the pipe. Now... to the right leads to a later part of the\
      \ level, so go instead back to the left. Surface and head to the right to find\
      \ a plank that you can use to get back onto the lake's banks. Time to move on.\
      \ So, go to the crossing and back through the arch. You will emerge in another\
      \ small uphill canyon; go to the left of the large rock here for a box of 50\
      \ Bullets. Head on up the canyon, but beware the SkaarjScout lurking beyond\
      \ the rock.\n\nAt the top of the canyon, you will arrive at another lake where\
      \ a SkaarjWarrior comes bounding across a plank to the left. Kill it. There's\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit on the right if you need it. Ahead in the second lake\
      \ is a kind of Nali gazebo on stilts. So, dive into the lake and head for the\
      \ base of the gazebo. Kill the Devilfish lurking off to the left then take a\
      \ diversion to go round behind the gazebo stilts to read the log of a human\
      \ corpse you will find there [3].\n\nSurface and go to the base of the gazebo.\
      \ In the centre you will find a lift - step on to it and ride it to the top,\
      \ arriving inside the structure. There's a [[Stinger]] there, and the containers\
      \ reveal 40 Tarydium Shards, a Flare and a Nali Fruit Seed. Drop back into the\
      \ water and head for a sloping plank nearby which allows you to climb back out\
      \ to the land by which you entered this area. It might be hard to climb on it\
      \ as it is very small and you will usually just jump over it. Attempt to climb\
      \ out until you actually do.\n\nGo now to the other plank, the one the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ came across. Cross it yourself to reach a rock. From there, take another plank\
      \ across the lake to arrive on the far bank. On the bank, head up the following\
      \ valley to the right, going via an UMS drop box containing a 50 bullet CAR\
      \ Clip. Shortly, you will arrive at a small settlement with a Nali hut and a\
      \ barn, guarded by a SkaarjWarrior. Kill the Skaarj. Go towards the hut; a barrow\
      \ outside has two Nali Healing Fruit inside if you need them. Then, enter the\
      \ hut.\n\nThe hut is a typical Nali dwelling. Go to the left and onto the table\
      \ to collect an [[Automag]] from the hands of a human corpse. Read the corpse's\
      \ log [4].\n\nCrates in the hut contain a Clip and 40 Tarydium Shards. When\
      \ you're done, leave the humble home and head round to the left, past the barn\
      \ which contains a [[Nali Cow]] and a Nali Calf.\n\nFollow the slope of the\
      \ valley upwards. A large rock on the right has two Nali Healing Fruit behind\
      \ it should you need them. Shortly you will arrive at the top, where you will\
      \ see that the valley continues over the Crossing from here. Start across the\
      \ Crossing. A Krall will see you and run away across the bridge. Shoot open\
      \ barrels here for 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 50 Bullets. Give pursuit,\
      \ shooting open UMS drop boxes on the way for a [[Combat Assault Rifle]] and\
      \ a box of 10 Grenades. At the far end, the Krall who ran away will have been\
      \ joined by two others who attack.\n\nAt the far end, barrels contain a cluster\
      \ of 40 Tarydium Shards. Watch out here for four [[Pack Hunter]]s lurking on\
      \ the plateau ahead. Then, step on to the platform and look around. Here on\
      \ this plateau are two well entrances. The first is closed off but the second\
      \ is open. Shoot a barrel beyond the first for an ASMD Core and collect of the\
      \ two Nali Healing Fruit behind a rock at the back of the plateau, then jump\
      \ down the open well to exit the level.\n\n==Translator messages==\n#\"Terra-Neo\
