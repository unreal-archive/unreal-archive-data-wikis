      \ I've come up with some more of the speculation. What do you think:\n</p><p>By\
      \ default, if you have UGold and choose any other type of character than UPak\
      \ one you will be set as Carter. So depending on this I will say that the Prisoner\
      \ 849 was Carter; Maybe it was Gina, but let's say it's Carter.\n</p><p>So,\
      \ Carter Kolodenko was first an <a href=\"/UMS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      UMS\">UMS</a> prisoner (#849), being sent to a Prison Moon (which one?). Notice\
      \ the Vortex Rikers sign on his T-Shirt. The texture names reveal that it is\
      \ actually the Vortex Rikers logo, that's a fact. So Carter must have done something\
      \ really awful to get himself in that kind of a state.\n</p><p>In 2215, Carter\
      \ escaped, killed the <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> Queen\
      \ and started the Human-Skaarj wars. That's mighty, don't you think? No normal\
      \ guy could do all of that. Even more, he almost escaped <a href=\"/Na_Pali\"\
      \ title=\"Na Pali\">Na Pali</a> - but think how mad UMS were! Carter did something\
      \ to get himself a prisoner (maybe killed someone?), and now he started a war\
      \ against the Skaarj! But the guys on <a href=\"/UMS_Bodega_Bay\" title=\"UMS\
      \ Bodega Bay\">UMS Bodega Bay</a> weren't idiots and figured out that Carter\
      \ is too mighty to be simply killed (sent out of the airlock without a suit),\
      \ and can be used for missions without risking their own marines. Just like\
      \ other people with the <a href=\"/AS-Convoy\" title=\"AS-Convoy\">Nexus missiles</a>\
      \ later, UMS Bodega Bay guys sent Carter on <a href=\"/Operation_Talon_Hunter\"\
      \ title=\"Operation Talon Hunter\">Operation Talon Hunter</a> in order to get\
      \ a secret weapon log. The weapons might be good for stopping the Skaarj - at\
      \ least Carter will do something for <a href=\"/NEG\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"NEG\">NEG</a>.\n</p><p>But Carter was even more mighty and managed\
      \ to escape Na Pali again, and even destroy UMS Bodega Bay. But the shuttle\
      \ he used, as earlier, didn't have too much fuel - after all, it was only used\
      \ for flights to UMS Bodega Bay. Now imagine the rage of UMS when they got their\
      \ hands on Carter the third time! The first crime, Human-Skaarj war, killed\
      \ Marines, destroyed warship... But again, UMS saw that killing Carter wouldn't\
      \ give anything for them. So again Carter was sent to a prison. But this time\
      \ not to a moon, but to <a href=\"/Alleria\" title=\"Alleria\">Alleria</a> Penal\
      \ Colony. That was somewhere around 2217.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"\
      ><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:152px;\"><a href=\"/File:Frostbite.jpg\"\
      \ class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/w/images/thumb/Frostbite.jpg/150px-Frostbite.jpg\"\

      \ class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/File:Frostbite.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"\
      Enlarge\"></a></div>Frostbite</div></div></div>\n<p>Now look at this... Sounds\
      \ familiar? Yeap. Carter Kolodenko was kept in Alleria for quite a long time,\
      \ along with the other starting <a href=\"/Juggernauts\" title=\"Juggernauts\"\
      >Juggernauts</a>. Can you see the similarities? Carter had a mechanical leg\
      \ and was bald. As time passed, Juggernauts copied everything from the first\
      \ colonists, including the mechanical armour (that led to the heavy suits).\
      \ To make Carter less of a threat to the UMS (he could escape from there too!),\
      \ they gene-boosted him. That proved to be a good way to manage the criminals\
      \ and onwards they all were gene-boosted. Of course, there's not much of use\
      \ from Carter when he's just mining iridium, so he probably got an offer to\
      \ join some kind of underground tournaments that were before <a href=\"/Liandri_Grand_Tournament\"\
      \ title=\"Liandri Grand Tournament\">Liandri Grand Tournament</a> - those were\
      \ even officially mentioned. Or maybe he himself attended the Tournament as\
      \ well - gene boosting probably prolongs the living time, as the age of Juggernauts\
      \ is officially counted in a format like that: \"34 years RT\": maybe that's\
      \ the time since the gene boost?\n</p><p>Then Nikolai Kolodenko, AKA Frostbite,\
      \ was born (there's a chance that it's Carter after all, but not very likely).\
      \ See how they are both similar? They're even both bald. Nikolai got an offer\
      \ to attend the now <a href=\"/Liandri_Grand_Tournament\" title=\"Liandri Grand\
      \ Tournament\">Liandri Grand Tournament</a>, and having almost the same might\
      \ of Carter, he managed to get well known. Gorge, however, was somewhat stronger,\
      \ therefore was the leader of the group. Now Nikolai still tries to get a high\
      \ place in the Tournament, and maybe a few years later we will see him as the\
      \ champion.\n</p><p>So what do you think?&#160;:) I know you're going to ask\
      \ for proof, but hey, that's just speculation. Still interesting how things\
      \ can be. --<a href=\"/User:GreatEmerald\" title=\"User:GreatEmerald\">GreatEmerald</a>\
