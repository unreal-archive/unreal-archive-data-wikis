      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Beyond the hellish <a href=\"/Demonlord%27s_Lair\" title=\"Demonlord's\
      \ Lair\">Demonlord's Lair</a>, you arrive in a Skaarj storage facility that\
      \ borders on a huge crater. This is the docking site for the Skaarj Mothership;\
      \ your journey is almost over - but the hardest challenges still lie ahead.\n\
      </p><p>You start at the base of the lift you saw at the end of the previous\
      \ level. So, press the button nearby and step on to the lift, riding the long\
      \ distance to the top. You arrive at the top of the lift shaft in a short corridor\
      \ before a darkened storage facility. Open crates nearby for in this corridor\
      \ for a <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a>, a <a href=\"\
      /Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flare</a> and a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a>, then step forwards\
      \ into the facility.\n</p><p>The power is off and the facility is extremely\
      \ dark, so use a Flare or the Flashlight, because as you enter the facility\
      \ a <a href=\"/Pupae\" title=\"Pupae\">Pupae</a> jumps down from a box ahead\
      \ and attacks you. Kill it. Then, by Flare light, collect the <a href=\"/Enforcer\"\
      \ title=\"Enforcer\">Automag</a> and two Clips nearby. Dispose of any dangerous\
      \ explosive barrels that you find, so that they don't hurt you later.\n</p><p>Weave\
      \ your way through the large storage boxes so that you arrive at the back of\
      \ the facility, but beware the <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjTrooper</a> with a <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"\
      Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a> who drops down at this point. Kill\
      \ him, then go to the left for two Clips. From there, go to the back for a Flare.\
      \ At the back of the facility is an entrance to a darkened corridor that goes\
      \ down; shoot the barrel in the entrance and collect the Health Pack there,\
      \ then read a nearby sign [1].\n</p><p>Enter the corridor and go down its slope.\
      \ Shoot any explosive barrels you find on the way. Soon you will some out in\
      \ a room at the bottom of the corridor. As you enter, kill the two Pupae that\
      \ attack. Then, go to the right into the room and operate the panel there (NOT\
      \ the panel on the left inside the room) [2].\n</p><p>After the generator is\
      \ activated, lights come on throughout the facility. Explore this room. There\
      \ are two Health Packs at this end, and one at the other. Wooden crates beyond\
      \ the generator reveal a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak\
      \ Cannon</a> and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Collect, but still DON'T operate the\
      \ other panel. Return instead up the corridor to the corridor to the storage\
      \ facility.\n</p><p>Now that power has been restored, you can see. Return to\
      \ the other side of the storage facility, do an about turn, and climb the ramp\
      \ to the left. Go round to the top of the ramp, killing any Pupae who jump off\
      \ the storage boxes as you climb, and shooting the barrel at the top. Between\
      \ starting the ascent and arriving at the top having destroyed the barrel, I\
      \ had caught the attention of and killed four Pupae. At the top, collect of\
      \ the Flare and two Health Packs.\n</p><p>From here, look at the stacks of boxes.\
      \ On top of the highest stacks are armour items, while a wooden crate on a lower\
      \ part of the stack contains an ASMD Core (in shooting that open I attracted\
      \ the attention of a fifth Pupae which I killed). Wooden crates on the lowest\
      \ equipment boxes contain two cans of 12 Eightballs. You can reach the Eightballs\
      \ from here, so jump down and collect them. Then, look at wooden crates on the\
      \ floor in the area that was to the left as you looked out from the balcony.\
      \ They reveal a Health Pack, an <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket\
      \ Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a>, a can of 12 Eightballs and <a href=\"/Jump_Boots\"\
      \ title=\"Jump Boots\">Jump Boots</a>. Collect the first three items.\n</p><p>Now,\
      \ the tricky part; the box-hopping. Collect the Jump Boots (be careful as you\
      \ will need all three jumps) and stand at the base of the tallest stack (the\
      \ nearest one). Activate the boots and jump from the floor to the first level\
      \ up that you can land on. From there, jump to the top of the box to collect\
      \ a <a href=\"/Power_Shield\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Power Shield\">Power\
      \ Shield</a> (a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield\
      \ Belt\">Shield Belt</a> with twice the energy). Deactivate the boots then drop\
      \ down to the next box down on the right, where you shot a crate open for an\
      \ ASMD Core. Collect the core.\n</p><p>From the ASMD Core's location, activate\
      \ the Jump Boots and use their last jump to jump from there to the top of the\
      \ other stack, where there is an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a>. From there, look down the side of\
      \ the box facing the level entrance, and you will see a wooden crate on the\
      \ next box down that was obscured from view when you were on the balcony. Shoot\
      \ it and drop down for a box of 10 Flak Shells.\n</p><p>When you're done, drop\
      \ to the floor and return to the back of the facility. Go back down the corridor\
      \ to the Generator and Loading Room.\n</p><p>It's time to activate the other\
      \ panel. So, approach it and activate it, reading the translator message [3].\n\
      </p><p>Things are hotting up in the storage facility now, so make your way back\
      \ up the corridor. In the facility, a door has opened at the top of the ramps\
      \ and SkaarjTroopers with Dispersion Pistols are coming out and jumping down.\
      \ You will have to kill several (I made it 5 on this difficulty setting) before\
      \ you can safely proceed. Deal with them all.\n</p><p>When they're all dead,\
      \ go through the door and along the short corridor within to the end, killing\
      \ the <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjLord</a>\
      \ that meets you there. The corridor turns into a lift shaft; press the panel\
      \ nearby to call the triangular lift then step aboard.\n</p><p>The lift rises\
      \ automatically to a control room at the top. Step off the lift, and you will\
      \ see that the room overlooks through a barred window a huge crater in which\
      \ the Skaarj Mothership has landed.\n</p><p>The corridor out of this room currently\
      \ leads nowhere. So, raid the room for gear. There are three Health Packs on\
      \ the left, while wooden crates on the right reveal 40 Tarydium Shards, an ASMD\
      \ Core, a can of 12 Eightballs, a can of Tarydium Sludge, a box of 8 Rifle Rounds\
      \ and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Collect, then activate the panel that is on the\
      \ left as you face the window [4].\n</p><p>A portal has now formed in the previously\
      \ dead-end corridor. Just a curiosity first before you leave though; look on\
      \ the right of the Mothership and you will see energy streamers coming out of\
      \ the underside. Use the rifle to zoom in on ground at the bottom of the nearest\
      \ one, and you will see a speck turn into a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjInfantry</a> with an Eightball Gun. The level\
      \ designer <a href=\"/Juan_Pancho_Eekels\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Juan\
      \ Pancho Eekels\">Juan Pancho Eekels</a> has stated that the otherwise unreachable\
      \ Skaarj there was his idea and an exciting easter egg.\n</p><p>So, go along\
      \ the corridor and through the new portal. The portal takes you out in a large\
      \ circular red-lit area with an open roof in the centre of the Mothership; a\
      \ huge opening on the floor in the centre is blocked by a force field. This\
      \ room is guarded by three SkaarjTroopers with Dispersion Pistols. When you\
      \ have killed them, start looking round for an exit. Eventually you will find\
      \ a door beneath a support strut on the opposite side of the huge room from\
      \ the entrance; go through the door to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ Infantry]]\n\n\n==Walkthrough==\n''This walkthrough was completed on Medium\
      \ difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\
      \nBeyond the hellish [[Demonlord's Lair]], you arrive in a Skaarj storage facility\
      \ that borders on a huge crater. This is the docking site for the Skaarj Mothership;\
      \ your journey is almost over - but the hardest challenges still lie ahead.\n\
      \nYou start at the base of the lift you saw at the end of the previous level.\
      \ So, press the button nearby and step on to the lift, riding the long distance\
      \ to the top. You arrive at the top of the lift shaft in a short corridor before\
      \ a darkened storage facility. Open crates nearby for in this corridor for a\
      \ [[Flashlight]], a [[Flare]] and a [[Super Health Pack]], then step forwards\
      \ into the facility.\n\nThe power is off and the facility is extremely dark,\
      \ so use a Flare or the Flashlight, because as you enter the facility a [[Pupae]]\
      \ jumps down from a box ahead and attacks you. Kill it. Then, by Flare light,\
      \ collect the [[Enforcer|Automag]] and two Clips nearby. Dispose of any dangerous\
      \ explosive barrels that you find, so that they don't hurt you later.\n\nWeave\
      \ your way through the large storage boxes so that you arrive at the back of\
      \ the facility, but beware the [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper|SkaarjTrooper]]\
      \ with a [[Dispersion Pistol]] who drops down at this point. Kill him, then\
      \ go to the left for two Clips. From there, go to the back for a Flare. At the\
      \ back of the facility is an entrance to a darkened corridor that goes down;\
      \ shoot the barrel in the entrance and collect the Health Pack there, then read\
      \ a nearby sign [1].\n\nEnter the corridor and go down its slope. Shoot any\
      \ explosive barrels you find on the way. Soon you will some out in a room at\
      \ the bottom of the corridor. As you enter, kill the two Pupae that attack.\
      \ Then, go to the right into the room and operate the panel there (NOT the panel\
      \ on the left inside the room) [2].\n\nAfter the generator is activated, lights\
      \ come on throughout the facility. Explore this room. There are two Health Packs\
      \ at this end, and one at the other. Wooden crates beyond the generator reveal\
      \ a [[Flak Cannon]] and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Collect, but still DON'T operate\
      \ the other panel. Return instead up the corridor to the corridor to the storage\
      \ facility.\n\nNow that power has been restored, you can see. Return to the\
      \ other side of the storage facility, do an about turn, and climb the ramp to\
      \ the left. Go round to the top of the ramp, killing any Pupae who jump off\
      \ the storage boxes as you climb, and shooting the barrel at the top. Between\
      \ starting the ascent and arriving at the top having destroyed the barrel, I\
      \ had caught the attention of and killed four Pupae. At the top, collect of\
      \ the Flare and two Health Packs.\n\nFrom here, look at the stacks of boxes.\
      \ On top of the highest stacks are armour items, while a wooden crate on a lower\
      \ part of the stack contains an ASMD Core (in shooting that open I attracted\
      \ the attention of a fifth Pupae which I killed). Wooden crates on the lowest\
      \ equipment boxes contain two cans of 12 Eightballs. You can reach the Eightballs\
      \ from here, so jump down and collect them. Then, look at wooden crates on the\
      \ floor in the area that was to the left as you looked out from the balcony.\
      \ They reveal a Health Pack, an [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Gun]], a can of\
      \ 12 Eightballs and [[Jump Boots]]. Collect the first three items.\n\nNow, the\
      \ tricky part; the box-hopping. Collect the Jump Boots (be careful as you will\
      \ need all three jumps) and stand at the base of the tallest stack (the nearest\
      \ one). Activate the boots and jump from the floor to the first level up that\
      \ you can land on. From there, jump to the top of the box to collect a [[Power\
      \ Shield]] (a [[Shield Belt]] with twice the energy). Deactivate the boots then\
      \ drop down to the next box down on the right, where you shot a crate open for\
      \ an ASMD Core. Collect the core.\n\nFrom the ASMD Core's location, activate\
      \ the Jump Boots and use their last jump to jump from there to the top of the\
      \ other stack, where there is an [[Assault Vest]]. From there, look down the\
      \ side of the box facing the level entrance, and you will see a wooden crate\
      \ on the next box down that was obscured from view when you were on the balcony.\
      \ Shoot it and drop down for a box of 10 Flak Shells.\n\nWhen you're done, drop\
      \ to the floor and return to the back of the facility. Go back down the corridor\
      \ to the Generator and Loading Room.\n\nIt's time to activate the other panel.\
      \ So, approach it and activate it, reading the translator message [3].\n\nThings\
      \ are hotting up in the storage facility now, so make your way back up the corridor.\
      \ In the facility, a door has opened at the top of the ramps and SkaarjTroopers\
      \ with Dispersion Pistols are coming out and jumping down. You will have to\
      \ kill several (I made it 5 on this difficulty setting) before you can safely\
      \ proceed. Deal with them all.\n\nWhen they're all dead, go through the door\
      \ and along the short corridor within to the end, killing the [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord|SkaarjLord]]\
      \ that meets you there. The corridor turns into a lift shaft; press the panel\
      \ nearby to call the triangular lift then step aboard.\n\nThe lift rises automatically\
      \ to a control room at the top. Step off the lift, and you will see that the\
      \ room overlooks through a barred window a huge crater in which the Skaarj Mothership\
      \ has landed.\n\nThe corridor out of this room currently leads nowhere. So,\
      \ raid the room for gear. There are three Health Packs on the left, while wooden\
      \ crates on the right reveal 40 Tarydium Shards, an ASMD Core, a can of 12 Eightballs,\
      \ a can of Tarydium Sludge, a box of 8 Rifle Rounds and a box of 10 Flak Shells.\
      \ Collect, then activate the panel that is on the left as you face the window\
      \ [4].\n\nA portal has now formed in the previously dead-end corridor. Just\
      \ a curiosity first before you leave though; look on the right of the Mothership\
      \ and you will see energy streamers coming out of the underside. Use the rifle\
      \ to zoom in on ground at the bottom of the nearest one, and you will see a\
      \ speck turn into a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry|SkaarjInfantry]] with an\
      \ Eightball Gun. The level designer [[Juan Pancho Eekels]] has stated that the\
      \ otherwise unreachable Skaarj there was his idea and an exciting easter egg.\n\
      \nSo, go along the corridor and through the new portal. The portal takes you\
      \ out in a large circular red-lit area with an open roof in the centre of the\
      \ Mothership; a huge opening on the floor in the centre is blocked by a force\
      \ field. This room is guarded by three SkaarjTroopers with Dispersion Pistols.\
      \ When you have killed them, start looking round for an exit. Eventually you\
      \ will find a door beneath a support strut on the opposite side of the huge\
      \ room from the entrance; go through the door to exit the level.\n\n==Translator\
