      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements differs heavily on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>You start in the cave beneath the hole you entered at the end of the\
      \ previous level. It stretches down a slope ahead; step forwards and descend\
      \ the tunnel.\n</p><p>At the bottom of the slope, the cave rounds a corner to\
      \ the right. Follow it and destroy crates in the tunnel for two ASMD Cores,\
      \ then collect them and continue round the corner beyond. Doing so, you will\
      \ find that the caves become icy and foggy again. You must be approaching the\
      \ open air.\n</p><p>Enter the icy cave ahead, collecting the two <a href=\"\
      /Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a> on\
      \ the right as you go if necessary. In the cave, the corpse of a UMS Prometheus\
      \ crew member is slumped against a pit prop to the right. Read his log [1].\n\
      </p><p>Continue through the cave, collecting two <a href=\"/Rocket_Pack#Unreal\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rocket Pack\">cans of 12 Eightballs</a> from\
      \ the left of the mouth of a tunnel ahead. Follow the tunnel, readying your\
      \ <a href=\"/ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a> or another\
      \ good weapon. Descending the tunnel, you will reach another icy cave which\
      \ is guarded by a <a href=\"/Mercenary\" title=\"Mercenary\">Mercenary</a>.\
      \ Surprise it and kill it. Enter the small cave. A tunnel leaves this cave to\
      \ the right. Collect the <a href=\"/Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Health Pack\">Health Pack</a> from on top of a box to the left, then head up\
      \ the tunnel. It is guarded by two Mercenaries; kill them. A wooden crate on\
      \ the right reveals a box of 50 Bullets.\n</p><p>Continue up the tunnel. Approaching\
      \ the mouth of the tunnel at the far end, you can collect two clusters of 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards from the left. Do so. Then, go to the mouth of the tunnel\
      \ and look through to the outdoor scene beyond.\n</p><p>Out here, a long icy\
      \ zig-zagged causeway ascends a slope towards a building on a plateau at the\
      \ top. To either side, an abyss drops down an impossibly long way. Select the\
      \ <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a> or another <a href=\"/Hitscan\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Hitscan\">hitscan</a> weapon, and start heading up the\
      \ torchlit precipice. It is extremely slippery and thus deadly - very easy to\
      \ fall off. Climbing up past the first corner, you will see a MercenaryElite\
      \ on guard near a torch ahead. Kill it, then collect the Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ and can of 12 Eightballs from beside said torch.\n</p><p>Carry on up the causeway.\
      \ Don't waste any time now. Approaching the main plateau with the building,\
      \ you can collect a Nali Healing Fruit on the fly. Once safely at the plateau,\
      \ kill the Mercenary there that is guarding a bunch of UMS drop boxes.\n</p><p>You\
      \ are at the foot of the building. Open the drop boxes here for a <a href=\"\
      /Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"Grenade Launcher\">Grenade Launcher</a> and two\
      \ 50 bullet CAR Clips, then look around. The plateau continues in a ring around\
      \ the building; start heading round it in an anticlockwise direction. You will\
      \ soon reach an entrance on the corner of the building to the left with a ramp\
      \ up to a foyer inside that is guarded by two Mercenaries. Kill the Mercenaries.\n\
      </p><p>Enter the foyer. There are doors inward from here, but let's scout around\
      \ outside first. Leave the foyer by the other ramp and continue along the side\
      \ of the building following your anticlockwise loop. Passing a rock, you will\
      \ find a Mercenary on guard, so kill it. When you reach the back end of the\
      \ building, go on round the corner and continue anticlockwise.\n</p><p>Round\
      \ the back, you will see a rock ahead. UMS drop boxes are beyond to the left\
      \ of the boulder. Go to the right of the rock first and you can collect two\
      \ cans of 12 Eightballs from beneath a torch. You will also see that a ledge\
      \ descends round the plateau cliff from here. Leave it for now - you'll be going\
      \ down there later.\n</p><p>Go back round the rock and open the two UMS drop\
      \ boxes there. In doing so you will alert a gaggle of two Mercenaries and a\
      \ MercenaryElite on guard - I found the <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"\
      Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a> quite effective here. When you have disposed\
      \ of the three, collect the Rocket Launcher and 50 bullet CAR Clip the boxes\
      \ have revealed. Then, head on round the side of the building. Turning the corner,\
      \ you should be heading back along the building's longer side towards the front.\
      \ Watch out for a MercenaryElite on guard.\n</p><p>As you approach the corner\
      \ at the front of the building, you will see a ramp and foyer similar to the\
      \ one you visited before on the other side of the building. Enter it and kill\
      \ the single Mercenary on guard. Now, look at the two doors into the building.\
      \ Take the rightermost of the two; you will arrive in an indoor chamber guarded\
      \ by a Mercenary. Kill the Mercenary and look around; you will see a barrel\
      \ that you can shoot for an ASMD Core.\n</p><p>A corridor leads out of this\
      \ room to the left. Take it. Passing an entrance to the right, you will be met\
      \ by a Mercenary. Kill it then go into its chamber. This chamber is similar\
      \ to the previous one but has wooden crates that reveal a Health Pack and a\
      \ can of 12 Eightballs. There's also a door off to the left behind which you\
      \ can hear Mercenary voices. Leave it for now.\n</p><p>Go back out of this room\
      \ into the inner corridor you just left, then follow it on round. A corner later\
      \ and you are led to another junction. Kill another Mercenary that attacks from\
      \ the entrance to the right, then go straight on out of the corridor into the\
      \ chamber at the end. Here, containers reveal a <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"\
      Flare\">Flare</a>, a box of 10 Flak Shells and a Health Pack.\n</p><p>A door\
      \ to the left just leads back outside, so return to this end of the inner corridor\
      \ and take the junction to the left into the chamber where the Mercenary attacked\
      \ you from just now. Here, containers reveal a box of 50 Bullets and a Health\
      \ Pack. There's also a door to the right - you can hear behind it the Mercenary\
      \ voices you avoided earlier. Select a powerful gun like the <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\"\
      \ title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a> and go through the door - you will find\
      \ yourself in a large hall guarded by a gaggle of two Mercenaries and a MercenaryElite.\
      \ Kill the guards then look around.\n</p><p>This hall has in its centre a huge\
      \ teleporter device. Open barrels to the right of where you came in for a 25kg\
      \ can of Tarydium Sludge and a Clip near a door (which is the inner door you\
      \ ignored earlier). Go to the centre of the hall and step on the teleporter;\
      \ you'll get a message [2].\n</p><p>This won't work yet then. Before leaving\
      \ the hall, go round the edges of the hall clockwise getting goodies from wooden\
      \ crates. The first lot reveals a box of 10 Flak Shells. A single crate further\
      \ round reveals an ASMD Core. On the third side of the room, you will find a\
      \ crate that reveals a Health Pack. You'll return to the front end of the room\
      \ at the far side from where you entered. There are two further doors here.\
      \ Near the leftermost door is a barrel that reveals a Clip. Collect the Clip,\
      \ then go through said door.\n</p><p>Entering another small chamber much like\
      \ the ones you raided before, you'll run into a Mercenary. Kill the Mercenary\
      \ then open containers for a Clip and 40 Tarydium Shards. Head to the right,\
      \ and you'll be in another access corridor that leads to either side.\n</p><p>Go\
      \ left first into another chamber for a barrel that contains a Health Pack.\
      \ A door here leads outside but there's more gear to collect yet, so go back\
      \ into the corridor and go along the access corridor in the other direction.\
      \ It'll head round to the left and you'll be attacked by a Mercenary from ahead.\
      \ Kill the Mercenary then continue along the corridor and go through a door\
      \ to the right. Kill another Mercenary that intercepts you here, then open containers\
      \ for an ASMD Core and a <a href=\"/Nali_Fruit_Seed\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Nali Fruit Seed\">Nali Fruit Seed</a>.\n</p><p>A door here only leads\
      \ back into the large hall, so return to the corridor and go to the right into\
      \ the final chamber. Chests behind a cross at the far end reveal two boxes of\
      \ 10 Flak Shells. From there, go through the door to the left to return outside\
      \ to the first entrance foyer you saw earlier.\n</p><p>The teleporter message\
      \ referred to an underground control unit. Do you remember that ramp that lead\
      \ down round the plateau cliff? That's where you want to go now. So, go straight\
      \ on from the door and out of the foyer. Turn left and, once again, follow the\
      \ plateau round anticlockwise. At the back, approach the top of the sloping\
      \ walkway near a torch to the right of a rock.\n</p><p>Make your way down the\
      \ causeway. It is very slippery so hug the cliff - use your strafing keys to\
      \ do so - at times it looks as if it is coming to an abrupt end, but stick to\
      \ it. Eventually, you'll be on a torchlit section beneath the main access causeway\
      \ above.\n</p><p>At this point, a tunnel leads downwards and into the plateau\
      \ cliff. Step down the tunnel and you will be in a small cave where a MercenaryElite\
      \ operates a panel. Kill the Mercenary and operate the panel yourself. It displays\
      \ a message [3].\n</p><p>The big teleporter will be active now. Go back up the\
      \ tunnel and left onto the walkway outside. Follow it on round the cliff. Climbing\
      \ up again, soon you will be back on the plateau round the right hand side of\
      \ the building - go back along to the front.\n</p><p>Your destination is the\
      \ large central hall of the building, so find one of the entrances and follow\
      \ the chambers into the hall. You will see that the teleporter is online. As\
      \ you approach the teleporter, two huge <a href=\"/Spinner\" title=\"Spinner\"\
      >Spinners</a> may drop down. You can shoot them, but they are hard to kill,\
      \ so avoid them and step on to the teleporter to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ map in [[Unreal - Return to Na Pali|Unreal - Return to Na Pali's]] single\
      \ player game.\n\n;Author: [[Nivlek]]\n;Description: You are up in the mountains.\
      \ Having dropped through a hole in the ground, you have landed in an underground\
      \ cave. Your travels are continuing to lead you through increasingly hostile\
      \ terrain... but you must be nearly there by now!\n{{clear}}\n==Weapons and\

      \ bird]]\n* [[Spinner]]\n\n\n\n==Walkthrough==\n''This walkthrough was completed\
      \ on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements differs heavily on other\
      \ difficulty settings.''\n\nYou start in the cave beneath the hole you entered\
      \ at the end of the previous level. It stretches down a slope ahead; step forwards\
      \ and descend the tunnel.\n\nAt the bottom of the slope, the cave rounds a corner\
      \ to the right. Follow it and destroy crates in the tunnel for two ASMD Cores,\
      \ then collect them and continue round the corner beyond. Doing so, you will\
      \ find that the caves become icy and foggy again. You must be approaching the\
      \ open air.\n\nEnter the icy cave ahead, collecting the two [[Nali Healing Fruit]]\
      \ on the right as you go if necessary. In the cave, the corpse of a UMS Prometheus\
      \ crew member is slumped against a pit prop to the right. Read his log [1].\n\
      \nContinue through the cave, collecting two [[Rocket Pack#Unreal|cans of 12\
      \ Eightballs]] from the left of the mouth of a tunnel ahead. Follow the tunnel,\
      \ readying your [[ASMD]] or another good weapon. Descending the tunnel, you\
      \ will reach another icy cave which is guarded by a [[Mercenary]]. Surprise\
      \ it and kill it. Enter the small cave. A tunnel leaves this cave to the right.\
      \ Collect the [[Health Pack]] from on top of a box to the left, then head up\
      \ the tunnel. It is guarded by two Mercenaries; kill them. A wooden crate on\
      \ the right reveals a box of 50 Bullets.\n\nContinue up the tunnel. Approaching\
      \ the mouth of the tunnel at the far end, you can collect two clusters of 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards from the left. Do so. Then, go to the mouth of the tunnel\
      \ and look through to the outdoor scene beyond.\n\nOut here, a long icy zig-zagged\
      \ causeway ascends a slope towards a building on a plateau at the top. To either\
      \ side, an abyss drops down an impossibly long way. Select the [[Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle]] or another [[hitscan]] weapon, and start heading up the torchlit precipice.\
      \ It is extremely slippery and thus deadly - very easy to fall off. Climbing\
      \ up past the first corner, you will see a MercenaryElite on guard near a torch\
      \ ahead. Kill it, then collect the Nali Healing Fruit and can of 12 Eightballs\
      \ from beside said torch.\n\nCarry on up the causeway. Don't waste any time\
      \ now. Approaching the main plateau with the building, you can collect a Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit on the fly. Once safely at the plateau, kill the Mercenary there\
      \ that is guarding a bunch of UMS drop boxes.\n\nYou are at the foot of the\
      \ building. Open the drop boxes here for a [[Grenade Launcher]] and two 50 bullet\
      \ CAR Clips, then look around. The plateau continues in a ring around the building;\
      \ start heading round it in an anticlockwise direction. You will soon reach\
      \ an entrance on the corner of the building to the left with a ramp up to a\
      \ foyer inside that is guarded by two Mercenaries. Kill the Mercenaries.\n\n\
      Enter the foyer. There are doors inward from here, but let's scout around outside\
      \ first. Leave the foyer by the other ramp and continue along the side of the\
      \ building following your anticlockwise loop. Passing a rock, you will find\
      \ a Mercenary on guard, so kill it. When you reach the back end of the building,\
      \ go on round the corner and continue anticlockwise.\n\nRound the back, you\
      \ will see a rock ahead. UMS drop boxes are beyond to the left of the boulder.\
      \ Go to the right of the rock first and you can collect two cans of 12 Eightballs\
      \ from beneath a torch. You will also see that a ledge descends round the plateau\
      \ cliff from here. Leave it for now - you'll be going down there later.\n\n\
      Go back round the rock and open the two UMS drop boxes there. In doing so you\
      \ will alert a gaggle of two Mercenaries and a MercenaryElite on guard - I found\
      \ the [[Rocket Launcher]] quite effective here. When you have disposed of the\
      \ three, collect the Rocket Launcher and 50 bullet CAR Clip the boxes have revealed.\
      \ Then, head on round the side of the building. Turning the corner, you should\
      \ be heading back along the building's longer side towards the front. Watch\
      \ out for a MercenaryElite on guard.\n\nAs you approach the corner at the front\
      \ of the building, you will see a ramp and foyer similar to the one you visited\
      \ before on the other side of the building. Enter it and kill the single Mercenary\
      \ on guard. Now, look at the two doors into the building. Take the rightermost\
      \ of the two; you will arrive in an indoor chamber guarded by a Mercenary. Kill\
      \ the Mercenary and look around; you will see a barrel that you can shoot for\
      \ an ASMD Core.\n\nA corridor leads out of this room to the left. Take it. Passing\
      \ an entrance to the right, you will be met by a Mercenary. Kill it then go\
      \ into its chamber. This chamber is similar to the previous one but has wooden\
      \ crates that reveal a Health Pack and a can of 12 Eightballs. There's also\
      \ a door off to the left behind which you can hear Mercenary voices. Leave it\
      \ for now.\n\nGo back out of this room into the inner corridor you just left,\
      \ then follow it on round. A corner later and you are led to another junction.\
      \ Kill another Mercenary that attacks from the entrance to the right, then go\
      \ straight on out of the corridor into the chamber at the end. Here, containers\
      \ reveal a [[Flare]], a box of 10 Flak Shells and a Health Pack.\n\nA door to\
      \ the left just leads back outside, so return to this end of the inner corridor\
      \ and take the junction to the left into the chamber where the Mercenary attacked\
      \ you from just now. Here, containers reveal a box of 50 Bullets and a Health\
      \ Pack. There's also a door to the right - you can hear behind it the Mercenary\
      \ voices you avoided earlier. Select a powerful gun like the [[Flak Cannon]]\
      \ and go through the door - you will find yourself in a large hall guarded by\
      \ a gaggle of two Mercenaries and a MercenaryElite. Kill the guards then look\
      \ around.\n\nThis hall has in its centre a huge teleporter device. Open barrels\
      \ to the right of where you came in for a 25kg can of Tarydium Sludge and a\
      \ Clip near a door (which is the inner door you ignored earlier). Go to the\
      \ centre of the hall and step on the teleporter; you'll get a message [2].\n\
      \nThis won't work yet then. Before leaving the hall, go round the edges of the\
      \ hall clockwise getting goodies from wooden crates. The first lot reveals a\
      \ box of 10 Flak Shells. A single crate further round reveals an ASMD Core.\
      \ On the third side of the room, you will find a crate that reveals a Health\
      \ Pack. You'll return to the front end of the room at the far side from where\
      \ you entered. There are two further doors here. Near the leftermost door is\
      \ a barrel that reveals a Clip. Collect the Clip, then go through said door.\n\
      \nEntering another small chamber much like the ones you raided before, you'll\
      \ run into a Mercenary. Kill the Mercenary then open containers for a Clip and\
      \ 40 Tarydium Shards. Head to the right, and you'll be in another access corridor\
      \ that leads to either side.\n\nGo left first into another chamber for a barrel\
      \ that contains a Health Pack. A door here leads outside but there's more gear\
      \ to collect yet, so go back into the corridor and go along the access corridor\
      \ in the other direction. It'll head round to the left and you'll be attacked\
      \ by a Mercenary from ahead. Kill the Mercenary then continue along the corridor\
      \ and go through a door to the right. Kill another Mercenary that intercepts\
      \ you here, then open containers for an ASMD Core and a [[Nali Fruit Seed]].\n\
      \nA door here only leads back into the large hall, so return to the corridor\
      \ and go to the right into the final chamber. Chests behind a cross at the far\
      \ end reveal two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. From there, go through the door to\
      \ the left to return outside to the first entrance foyer you saw earlier.\n\n\
      The teleporter message referred to an underground control unit. Do you remember\
      \ that ramp that lead down round the plateau cliff? That's where you want to\
      \ go now. So, go straight on from the door and out of the foyer. Turn left and,\
      \ once again, follow the plateau round anticlockwise. At the back, approach\
      \ the top of the sloping walkway near a torch to the right of a rock.\n\nMake\
      \ your way down the causeway. It is very slippery so hug the cliff - use your\
      \ strafing keys to do so - at times it looks as if it is coming to an abrupt\
      \ end, but stick to it. Eventually, you'll be on a torchlit section beneath\
      \ the main access causeway above.\n\nAt this point, a tunnel leads downwards\
      \ and into the plateau cliff. Step down the tunnel and you will be in a small\
      \ cave where a MercenaryElite operates a panel. Kill the Mercenary and operate\
      \ the panel yourself. It displays a message [3].\n\nThe big teleporter will\
      \ be active now. Go back up the tunnel and left onto the walkway outside. Follow\
      \ it on round the cliff. Climbing up again, soon you will be back on the plateau\
      \ round the right hand side of the building - go back along to the front.\n\n\
      Your destination is the large central hall of the building, so find one of the\
      \ entrances and follow the chambers into the hall. You will see that the teleporter\
      \ is online. As you approach the teleporter, two huge [[Spinner]]s may drop\
      \ down. You can shoot them, but they are hard to kill, so avoid them and step\
      \ on to the teleporter to exit the level.\n\n== Translator messages ==\n#\"\
      LOG: R. Wisnewski: Damn, it's cold. The walkway outside is impassable. I almost\
      \ fell off twice, and it's a long way down. I'll try again later. I have a feeling\
      \ it's going to be worth the effort to reach that structure up ahead.\"\n#\"\
