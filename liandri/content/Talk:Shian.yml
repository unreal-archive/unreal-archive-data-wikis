      \ you mention (<i>Ugly Fish, Bellow Fish, Diver, Killer Tadpole, School Fish</i>),\
      \ but I think they might be from another planet than whatever planet the Shian\
      \ live on, but like I said, still playing the game. I think they might be better\
      \ of in their own article, either something like \"Cut Unreal 2 animals\", or\
      \ \"Shian Homeworld\" or something like that.\n</p><p>I figured the planet all\
      \ the animals (in U2) live on would be a good place to describe them. I already\

      \ animal on <a href=\"/Category:Animals\" title=\"Category:Animals\">Category:Animals</a>.\
      \ I did the same for the <a href=\"/Rammer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\

      </p><p>I listed all the above as well as the other animals in a text file on\

      \ from <a href=\"/Hell\" title=\"Hell\">Hell</a>, <i>Hummer</i> (and <i>Snipe</i>?)\
      \ from <a href=\"/edit/Na_Koja_Abad?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Na Koja\
      \ Abad (page does not exist)\">Na Koja Abad</a>, <i>Killer Sprout</i> and flying\

      \ <i>Skink</i> (no skin?), <i>Snipe</i>, and <i>Water Dipper</i> (probably just\
      \ a plant with animations which is why it isn't a static mesh), which I haven't\
      \ encountered in the actual game yet, so no idea what planet they're from, or\
