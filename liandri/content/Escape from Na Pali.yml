      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements might differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>You start in a dark chamber on a teleporter landing pad. There is a set\
      \ of double doors ahead. Step through into a foyer beyond where a <a href=\"\
      /Nali\" title=\"Nali\">Nali</a> Priest summons you. Approach the Nali Priest\
      \ and he gestures, causing panels to open in the walls to either side of you,\
      \ revealing alcoves containing an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a> and two ASMD Cores. Collect the gear\
      \ from the alcoves, an <a href=\"/ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\"\
      >ASMD</a> lying on the floor of the hallway, and also two <a href=\"/Health_Pack\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health Pack\">Health Packs</a> by destroying\
      \ the nearby barrels. Then, go on through the hallway and through the double\
      \ doors at the far end.\n</p><p>As the doors open and you step out, you will\
      \ find that you are in some kind of Nali castle. You are attacked by a <a href=\"\
      /Krall\" title=\"Krall\">Krall</a> from the right and a Krall and KrallElite\
      \ from ahead. Kill them - the <a href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Automag\">Automag</a> is sufficient for this. This area of the castle is a long\
      \ approach walkway to a door ahead with water below; as you approach the door\
      \ (which is inside a covered area), it opens and a Krall comes out. Kill the\
      \ Krall and go through the door yourself. Here, your progress is barred by a\
      \ barred mesh gate, but you can collect here an Automag and a <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a>\
      \ from near a corpse. Read the corpse's log [1].\n</p><p>Evidently they didn't\
      \ manage to do that. Go back through the door to the covered area. There are\
      \ doors to either side. One of them is barred off with another gate, but the\
      \ other is passable - open it and step through. You will step out on to another\
      \ platform, and be spotted by a Krall and a KrallElite. While the KrallElite\
      \ attacks, the Krall will jump over the side of the platform into the water.\
      \ Kill the KrallElite.\n</p><p>This platform continues round to the right. Follow\
      \ it along. After a while you will reach an area where a Krall runs out of a\
      \ structure in the centre of the platform and slips over on a smear of blood\
      \ on the floor. Take advantage of this opportunity to kill it, then look around.\n\
      </p><p>The main exit from this platform is further off to the right, but first\
      \ look at the doors into the central structure. Go inside, and you will find\
      \ a series of ramps going down into a room below. Kill a Krall that comes up\
      \ the ramps, then go down yourself and collect the <a href=\"/Eightball_Gun\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eightball Gun\">Eightball Gun</a> from the room\
      \ at the bottom. There's a can of 12 Eightballs here too - you can also open\
      \ a barrel for a Health Pack.\n</p><p>Two doors lead out of this cellar room.\
      \ Take the one on the right and you will be on a platform at water level guarded\
      \ by a Krall. Kill the Krall then jump into the water and follow it beneath\
      \ the surface towards some UMS drop boxes to the left. Use your beefed up <a\
      \ href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a>\
      \ to kill a <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a> that attacks\
      \ from an extended area to the right as you go. Then, go ahead and destroy the\
      \ UMS drop boxes. Doing so will reveal a <a href=\"/Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"\
      Grenade Launcher\">Grenade Launcher</a> and two 50 bullet CAR Clips, but as\
      \ you collect them watch out for another Devilfish ahead.\n</p><p>Before returning\
      \ from the water, go on round to the right and to the most distant corner of\
      \ this area. Surface and you will see an entrance in the wall; climb out and\
      \ enter the hidden area. This secret area continues round to the right. First\
      \ though, destroy barrels at the entrance for a <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"\
      Flashlight\">Flashlight</a> and a box of 50 Bullets, then enter the area proper.\
      \ There's a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a> on\
      \ the floor, and containers here reveal a <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\"\
      >Flare</a>, two Health Packs and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. There's also the\
      \ skeleton of a dead Nali lying by a diary [2].\n</p><p>When you're done, return\
      \ to the water and make your way back round to the platform where you first\
      \ entered the water. Climb out and go through the doors back to the room with\
      \ the ramps, then go through the other doors (to the right as you return). After\
      \ a short corridor, you will reach another platform at a different section of\
      \ the pool. This too is guarded by a Krall, so kill it, then drop into the water\
      \ and look around with your <a href=\"/Searchlight\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Searchlight\">Searchlight</a>.\n</p><p>A Devilfish attacks from the left. Kill\
      \ it. Head off to the right, following the water as it goes round with the shape\
      \ of the cliff to the left. Soon you will come to three UMS drop boxes that\
      \ reveal a Combat Assault Rifle, a Grenade Launcher and a <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\"\
      \ title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a>. Kill a Devilfish here. There's\
      \ nothing more to do in this area, so return the way you came. Climb out at\
      \ the platform. If you want to explore the water more fully in the other direction\
      \ you can, but all you'll find is a bunch of Devilfish, the Krall that bailed\
      \ out earlier and at the furthest extremity a dead <a href=\"/Nali_Cow\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Nali Cow\">Nali Cow</a>, so it's not really worth it because\
      \ there's nothing useful.\n</p><p>Instead, leave the water at the platform and\
      \ return to the ramp room. Climb the ramps and go back out on to the large stone\
      \ walkway, then continue round to the other exit (beyond the structure from\
      \ which you just emerged). Go through the exit and kill a <a href=\"/Brute\"\
      \ title=\"Brute\">Brute</a> you meet coming the other way. Enter the hallway\
      \ beyond.\n</p><p>You are in a short hallway with doors at the far end. Shoot\
      \ barrels to collect a GES <a href=\"/Biorifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Biorifle\">Biorifle</a> and a 25kg can of Tarydium Sludge, then go along the\
      \ hall and through the doors at the far end. You emerge on another long outdoor\
      \ platform; two Krall and a KrallElite jump out from the far end and charge.\
      \ Decapitation with the Assault Rifle seems effective here.\n</p><p>Proceed\
      \ along the platform and pass through the doors at the far end. You are at a\
      \ junction with gates to either side. The gate to the left is locked, so go\
      \ first through the one to the right and through the doors beyond that. There,\
      \ you can collect a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a> and press a lever which unlocks the other gate\
      \ at the junction just now. Gates ahead lead back to the start of the map but\
      \ they are locked. So, turn around and go through the gates you just unlocked.\n\
      </p><p>You arrive on a very long open stone walkway. A chair to the right acts\
      \ as a step up on to the low wall there, but before using it go forwards until\
      \ two Krall and a KrallElite jump out from some chamners leading off the low\
      \ walls to either side. Head shot them. Then, return to the chair and use it\
      \ to jump up on to the wall (not into the water beyond), then follow it along\
      \ until you reach the Krall's alcoves. The two on this side reveal a can of\
      \ 12 Eightballs, and an Assault Rifle plus two Rifle Rounds.\n</p><p>More gear\
      \ is to be had from the two alcoves opposite. To get to them, drop down to the\
      \ walkway and continue along until you find a similar chair on that side of\
      \ the walkway. Use it to jump up on to the other wall then follow it back and\
      \ enter the alcoves for another can of 12 Eightballs and a <a href=\"/Stinger\"\
      \ title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> with two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards.\n</p><p>Time\
      \ to move on, so drop down and carry on along the walkway. As you approach the\
      \ doors at the far end, a very nasty SkaarjInfantry with a Flak Cannon comes\
      \ rushing out. Decapitate it from a distance. Collect rhe Flak Cannon dropped\
      \ by the Skaarj then go through the doors into the next hall. There, barrels\
      \ reveal a Health Pack and a box of 50 Bullets. Nearby, a <a href=\"/Minigun\"\
      \ title=\"Minigun\">Minigun</a> lies near a corpse. Collect the gun and read\
      \ the corpse's log [3].\n</p><p>Go along the hall and through the door at the\
      \ end. You'll be on the lower floor of a two level area where a SkaarjTrooper\
      \ with a Dispersion Pistol attacks from the right and a SkaarjLord lurks ahead.\
      \ Kill both the Skaarj, then traverse this open-roofed area to the far end where\
      \ you will find further doors. Go through them and along a short corridor into\
      \ the tall room beyond which has ramps going up round the sides. Here, a Krall\
      \ sees you and runs off up the ramps. Give chase and kill it, then do the same\
      \ for three more Krall and a KrallElite that descend from above. Return to the\
      \ ground floor.\nOn the floor of this room is a <a href=\"/Razorjack\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Razorjack\">Razorjack</a> and a box of Razor Blades. There's\
      \ also a Nali skeleton with a diary [4].\n</p><p>Climb the ramps. At the top,\
      \ a slope to the left leads to a door. Go to the door, first if necessary collecting\
      \ the two <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit</a> from ledges to either side of the slope and two cans of\
      \ 12 Eightballs from either side of the door.\n</p><p>Go through the door. You\
      \ are on a balcony above the area where you fought the <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"\
      Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> below. If you look down, you will see an intermediate roof\
      \ ring on which there are UMS drop boxes. There's also a hole off part of the\
      \ roof. There's a door on the far side of the balcony ring, but first drop down\
      \ onto the intermediate roof and open the drop boxes for a Combat Assault Rifle,\
      \ a Rocket Launcher and two 50 bullet CAR Clips. Then, go through the hole in\
      \ the wall and you collect a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a>, then dropping down to the\
      \ lower level below.\n</p><p>Find the ramps again and climb them, returning\
      \ to the balcony. This time, cross to the far side and go through the doors\
      \ there into a short corridor guarded by two Krall. Follow it to enter a room\
      \ at the far end with two Nali Healing Fruit, two cans of 12 Eightballs and\
      \ a lever. Collect what you need then press the lever. Be prepared, because\
      \ this is about to get nasty. Go outside again, killing the SkaarjLord that\
      \ attacks from the far side of the balcony ring.\n</p><p>Get down to the lower\
      \ level and go to the outer walkway, making sure you're not standing on the\
      \ central stone floor. You'll find if you try to leave the area that you're\
      \ locked in. Returning to the two-levelled area and walking around, there'll\
      \ be a brief unpleasant wait, then you'll hear wing beats and the central stone\
      \ floor will burst open, revealing a <a href=\"/Warlord\" title=\"Warlord\"\
      >Warlord</a> that soars from a fiery pit.\n</p><p>Fight the Warlord. Use your\
      \ Flak Shells, Eightballs and Rockets. When the Warlord finally dies, look for\
      \ the hall by which you initially entered this area (there are some easter eggs\
      \ in the pit of the Warlord though - you can use the fly cheat and read what\
      \ the Nali down there had to say). Go down the hall and you will find that the\
      \ doors at the far end have become unlocked again. Go through the doors and\
      \ follow the stone walkway beyond. Keep going straight on - gates and doors\
      \ will open as you go - until you reach the junction right back at the start\
      \ of the map with the alcove to the right containing the corpse. The gate within\
      \ has opened, revealing the much sought after shuttle in a tower beyond. Go\
      \ through the gateway to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ title=\"UMS Bodega Bay\">Bodega Bay</a> in orbit. A shuttle against a UMS\
      \ Freeman class cruiser. What a joke! The odds aren't good, but the shuttle\
      \ has a trans-light drive. If I'm very, very lucky, I can find some way to outsmart\
      \ or outfly the Bodega Bay. They sure as hell won't be expecting me! What's\
      \ the alternative... stay on the planet? [laughs] I'll take my chances in space.</blockquote><div\

      \ Lord]]\n\n\n\n==Walkthrough==\n''This walkthrough was completed on Medium\
      \ difficulty. Creature and item placements might differ on other difficulty\
      \ settings.''\n\nYou start in a dark chamber on a teleporter landing pad. There\
      \ is a set of double doors ahead. Step through into a foyer beyond where a [[Nali]]\
      \ Priest summons you. Approach the Nali Priest and he gestures, causing panels\
      \ to open in the walls to either side of you, revealing alcoves containing an\
      \ [[Assault Vest]] and two ASMD Cores. Collect the gear from the alcoves, an\
      \ [[ASMD]] lying on the floor of the hallway, and also two [[Health Pack]]s\
      \ by destroying the nearby barrels. Then, go on through the hallway and through\
      \ the double doors at the far end.\n\nAs the doors open and you step out, you\
      \ will find that you are in some kind of Nali castle. You are attacked by a\
      \ [[Krall]] from the right and a Krall and KrallElite from ahead. Kill them\
      \ - the [[Automag]] is sufficient for this. This area of the castle is a long\
      \ approach walkway to a door ahead with water below; as you approach the door\
      \ (which is inside a covered area), it opens and a Krall comes out. Kill the\
      \ Krall and go through the door yourself. Here, your progress is barred by a\
      \ barred mesh gate, but you can collect here an Automag and a [[Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle]] from near a corpse. Read the corpse's log [1].\n\nEvidently they didn't\
      \ manage to do that. Go back through the door to the covered area. There are\
      \ doors to either side. One of them is barred off with another gate, but the\
      \ other is passable - open it and step through. You will step out on to another\
      \ platform, and be spotted by a Krall and a KrallElite. While the KrallElite\
      \ attacks, the Krall will jump over the side of the platform into the water.\
      \ Kill the KrallElite.\n\nThis platform continues round to the right. Follow\
      \ it along. After a while you will reach an area where a Krall runs out of a\
      \ structure in the centre of the platform and slips over on a smear of blood\
      \ on the floor. Take advantage of this opportunity to kill it, then look around.\n\
      \nThe main exit from this platform is further off to the right, but first look\
      \ at the doors into the central structure. Go inside, and you will find a series\
      \ of ramps going down into a room below. Kill a Krall that comes up the ramps,\
      \ then go down yourself and collect the [[Eightball Gun]] from the room at the\
      \ bottom. There's a can of 12 Eightballs here too - you can also open a barrel\
      \ for a Health Pack.\n\nTwo doors lead out of this cellar room. Take the one\
      \ on the right and you will be on a platform at water level guarded by a Krall.\
      \ Kill the Krall then jump into the water and follow it beneath the surface\
      \ towards some UMS drop boxes to the left. Use your beefed up [[Dispersion Pistol]]\
      \ to kill a [[Devilfish]] that attacks from an extended area to the right as\
      \ you go. Then, go ahead and destroy the UMS drop boxes. Doing so will reveal\
      \ a [[Grenade Launcher]] and two 50 bullet CAR Clips, but as you collect them\
      \ watch out for another Devilfish ahead.\n\nBefore returning from the water,\
      \ go on round to the right and to the most distant corner of this area. Surface\
      \ and you will see an entrance in the wall; climb out and enter the hidden area.\
      \ This secret area continues round to the right. First though, destroy barrels\
      \ at the entrance for a [[Flashlight]] and a box of 50 Bullets, then enter the\
      \ area proper. There's a [[Flak Cannon]] on the floor, and containers here reveal\
      \ a [[Flare]], two Health Packs and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. There's also\
      \ the skeleton of a dead Nali lying by a diary [2].\n\nWhen you're done, return\
      \ to the water and make your way back round to the platform where you first\
      \ entered the water. Climb out and go through the doors back to the room with\
      \ the ramps, then go through the other doors (to the right as you return). After\
      \ a short corridor, you will reach another platform at a different section of\
      \ the pool. This too is guarded by a Krall, so kill it, then drop into the water\
      \ and look around with your [[Searchlight]].\n\nA Devilfish attacks from the\
      \ left. Kill it. Head off to the right, following the water as it goes round\
      \ with the shape of the cliff to the left. Soon you will come to three UMS drop\
      \ boxes that reveal a Combat Assault Rifle, a Grenade Launcher and a [[Rocket\
      \ Launcher]]. Kill a Devilfish here. There's nothing more to do in this area,\
      \ so return the way you came. Climb out at the platform. If you want to explore\
      \ the water more fully in the other direction you can, but all you'll find is\
      \ a bunch of Devilfish, the Krall that bailed out earlier and at the furthest\
      \ extremity a dead [[Nali Cow]], so it's not really worth it because there's\
      \ nothing useful.\n\nInstead, leave the water at the platform and return to\
      \ the ramp room. Climb the ramps and go back out on to the large stone walkway,\
      \ then continue round to the other exit (beyond the structure from which you\
      \ just emerged). Go through the exit and kill a [[Brute]] you meet coming the\
      \ other way. Enter the hallway beyond.\n\nYou are in a short hallway with doors\
      \ at the far end. Shoot barrels to collect a GES [[Biorifle]] and a 25kg can\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge, then go along the hall and through the doors at the far\
      \ end. You emerge on another long outdoor platform; two Krall and a KrallElite\
      \ jump out from the far end and charge. Decapitation with the Assault Rifle\
      \ seems effective here.\n\nProceed along the platform and pass through the doors\
      \ at the far end. You are at a junction with gates to either side. The gate\
      \ to the left is locked, so go first through the one to the right and through\
      \ the doors beyond that. There, you can collect a [[Shield Belt]] and press\
      \ a lever which unlocks the other gate at the junction just now. Gates ahead\
      \ lead back to the start of the map but they are locked. So, turn around and\
      \ go through the gates you just unlocked.\n\nYou arrive on a very long open\
      \ stone walkway. A chair to the right acts as a step up on to the low wall there,\
      \ but before using it go forwards until two Krall and a KrallElite jump out\
      \ from some chamners leading off the low walls to either side. Head shot them.\
      \ Then, return to the chair and use it to jump up on to the wall (not into the\
      \ water beyond), then follow it along until you reach the Krall's alcoves. The\
      \ two on this side reveal a can of 12 Eightballs, and an Assault Rifle plus\
      \ two Rifle Rounds.\n\nMore gear is to be had from the two alcoves opposite.\
      \ To get to them, drop down to the walkway and continue along until you find\
      \ a similar chair on that side of the walkway. Use it to jump up on to the other\
      \ wall then follow it back and enter the alcoves for another can of 12 Eightballs\
      \ and a [[Stinger]] with two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards.\n\nTime to move\
      \ on, so drop down and carry on along the walkway. As you approach the doors\
      \ at the far end, a very nasty SkaarjInfantry with a Flak Cannon comes rushing\
      \ out. Decapitate it from a distance. Collect rhe Flak Cannon dropped by the\
      \ Skaarj then go through the doors into the next hall. There, barrels reveal\
      \ a Health Pack and a box of 50 Bullets. Nearby, a [[Minigun]] lies near a corpse.\
      \ Collect the gun and read the corpse's log [3].\n\nGo along the hall and through\
      \ the door at the end. You'll be on the lower floor of a two level area where\
      \ a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol attacks from the right and a SkaarjLord\
      \ lurks ahead. Kill both the Skaarj, then traverse this open-roofed area to\
      \ the far end where you will find further doors. Go through them and along a\
      \ short corridor into the tall room beyond which has ramps going up round the\
      \ sides. Here, a Krall sees you and runs off up the ramps. Give chase and kill\
      \ it, then do the same for three more Krall and a KrallElite that descend from\
      \ above. Return to the ground floor.\nOn the floor of this room is a [[Razorjack]]\
      \ and a box of Razor Blades. There's also a Nali skeleton with a diary [4].\n\
      \nClimb the ramps. At the top, a slope to the left leads to a door. Go to the\
      \ door, first if necessary collecting the two [[Nali Healing Fruit]] from ledges\
      \ to either side of the slope and two cans of 12 Eightballs from either side\
      \ of the door.\n\nGo through the door. You are on a balcony above the area where\
      \ you fought the [[Skaarj]] below. If you look down, you will see an intermediate\
      \ roof ring on which there are UMS drop boxes. There's also a hole off part\
      \ of the roof. There's a door on the far side of the balcony ring, but first\
      \ drop down onto the intermediate roof and open the drop boxes for a Combat\
      \ Assault Rifle, a Rocket Launcher and two 50 bullet CAR Clips. Then, go through\
      \ the hole in the wall and you collect a [[Super Health Pack]], then dropping\
      \ down to the lower level below.\n\nFind the ramps again and climb them, returning\
      \ to the balcony. This time, cross to the far side and go through the doors\
      \ there into a short corridor guarded by two Krall. Follow it to enter a room\
      \ at the far end with two Nali Healing Fruit, two cans of 12 Eightballs and\
      \ a lever. Collect what you need then press the lever. Be prepared, because\
      \ this is about to get nasty. Go outside again, killing the SkaarjLord that\
      \ attacks from the far side of the balcony ring.\n\nGet down to the lower level\
      \ and go to the outer walkway, making sure you're not standing on the central\
      \ stone floor. You'll find if you try to leave the area that you're locked in.\
      \ Returning to the two-levelled area and walking around, there'll be a brief\
      \ unpleasant wait, then you'll hear wing beats and the central stone floor will\
      \ burst open, revealing a [[Warlord]] that soars from a fiery pit.\n\nFight\
      \ the Warlord. Use your Flak Shells, Eightballs and Rockets. When the Warlord\
      \ finally dies, look for the hall by which you initially entered this area (there\
      \ are some easter eggs in the pit of the Warlord though - you can use the fly\
      \ cheat and read what the Nali down there had to say). Go down the hall and\
      \ you will find that the doors at the far end have become unlocked again. Go\
      \ through the doors and follow the stone walkway beyond. Keep going straight\
      \ on - gates and doors will open as you go - until you reach the junction right\
      \ back at the start of the map with the alcove to the right containing the corpse.\
      \ The gate within has opened, revealing the much sought after shuttle in a tower\
      \ beyond. Go through the gateway to exit the level.\n\n==Translator messages==\n\
