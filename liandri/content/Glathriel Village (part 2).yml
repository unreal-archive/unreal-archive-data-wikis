      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Glathriel Village harbour seemed surprisingly free of Skaarj. Now, as\
      \ you drop into a strange crypt-like underground cellar, you find it dangerously\
      \ infested with voracious spider-like creatures.\n</p><p>You start in the cobweb-laden\
      \ crypt, on the floor below the hole through which you dropped to exit the previous\
      \ level. To either side in this small area are shelves, and ahead the crypt\
      \ opens out into a wider space.\n</p><p>Ready your Grenade Launcher. Set off\
      \ towards the area ahead. As you approach, you will hear a sharp hiss and you\
      \ will see a Spinner lurking in a dark alcove to the right. The Spinner will\
      \ not come towards you, so blow it up at your leisure. Step out into the central\
      \ area, where there is a tomb in the middle of a small hub room. There, another\
      \ Spinner will see you. This one comes scuttling towards you, so try and avoid\
      \ its acid attacks and fangs. Kill it.\n</p><p>Start straight across the crypt.\
      \ You will enter another offshoot much like the one in which you started. In\
      \ this offshoot, you will find that the first bottom shelf on the left contains\
      \ a <a href=\"/Seed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seed\">Nali Fruit Seed</a>,\
      \ a Flak Shell and an ASMD Core. Collect the gear. Return to the main crypt\
      \ and go to the right, arriving at the far end. There, two Spinners will sight\
      \ you from the corridor with the staircase ahead while two more will come from\
      \ further offshoots on either side. Kill all four.\n</p><p>Before leaving via\
      \ the staircase corridor, raid the remaining offshoots. In the offshoot to the\
      \ left, the back left shelf contains two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and\
      \ a Nali Fruit Seed. The back left shelf of the final offshoot contains two\
      \ further clisters of 40 Tarydium Shards.\nReturn to the crypt. If you want\
      \ you can push on the end of the tomb to open it, but it reveals nothing of\
      \ gaming value. Head instead up the corridor with the steps and enter the area\
      \ at the far end.\n</p><p>The area you are now in is a main crypt hall with\
      \ two minor halls on either side. Go past the first minor hall and look down\
      \ the main hall; a Spinner attacks from the far end. Kill it. Then, enter the\
      \ far minor hall and kill the Spinner there. Go along the minor hall. Remove\
      \ vases in the way in an alcove to the left then collect from said alcove a\
      \ set of <a href=\"/Bandages\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bandages\">Bandages</a>,\
      \ a box of 50 Bullets and two Flak Shells.\n</p><p>Go to the main hall and along\
      \ to the arches at the end. Go through the arches into the next small area,\
      \ where there are four doorways. The door to the right and the two doors ahead\
      \ each go into small tomb rooms, with a chest in each. Two of said chests reveal\
      \ a set of Bandages each. When you're done with the chests, go through the fourth\
      \ doorway, which leads to a staircase upwards. Climb the staircase to enter\
      \ a small hallway lit by lamp stands. Follow the hallway along and go through\
      \ a doorway at the far end, and you come out inside a church where a <a href=\"\
      /Nali\" title=\"Nali\">Nali</a> Priest prays by a dead Nali on an altar.\n</p><p>As\
      \ you approach the altar, a window above shatters and a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScout</a> leaps in through it, much to the\
      \ terror of the Nali. Try to kill the Skaarj without harming the Nali - the\
      \ Nali will still be afraid of you but at least he'll be alive. There's a UMS\
      \ drop box by the altar. Open it for a pack of 10 Grenades. Then, read a diary\
      \ the Nali Priest (who has probably scarpered) has left on the altar beside\
      \ the dead body [1].\n</p><p>When you're done, go to the double doors at the\
      \ far end of the church and step outside.\n</p><p>You are in a small garden\
      \ outside the church. Looking back at the church, you will see two barrels and\
      \ an exit from the garden. Shoot the barrels open for two clusters of 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards, then go through the exit from the garden. You come out in another\
      \ garden area where a <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"Manta\">Manta</a> swoops towards\
      \ you from the right. Kill it, then go into its corner for a <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\"\
      \ title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a>. When you're done, return\
      \ to the dirt path through the garden and follow it down towards the houses.\n\
      </p><p>The way is blocked in that area by a stack of hay bales. You can get\
      \ past the blockage by jumping up the slanting hay bale. If you have trouble\
      \ with that, you can go to a rock further along to the left and use it to jump\
      \ over the garden wall, but you'll land right in front of a Skaarj.\n</p><p>Once\
      \ over the bales, there are various ways to go. A grass path leads you to the\
      \ right, while there's a small village square ahead and a pathed path to the\
      \ left. First, go down the paved path. The path shortly turns a corner to the\
      \ right into an open area guarded by a [[Skaarj Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]. Kill\
      \ the Skaarj. Here, you will see that the open area is blocked by a collapsed\
      \ wooden bridge between two buildings. Turn around and return to the junction.\
      \ Go to the right at the junction, past the hay bales, and onto the grassy path.\
      \ Follow the path, collecting a Nali Healing Fruit on the way if you need it,\
      \ until you reach a doorway to a small courtyard on the left. You will find\
      \ that it is blocked by bars.\n</p><p>Go to the far end of the footpath. You\
      \ come out on a paved lakeside path. Ahead, the water stretches off a little\
      \ way into the dark, with a long jetty running parallel to the footpath. Go\
      \ along the path to the right. You will find a doorway back into one of the\
      \ buildings (some kind of barn) is also blocked by bars. A grassy area at the\
      \ end of the path reveals nothing, so take a dip into the lake. Go to the back\
      \ of the lake - beware two strong <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\"\
      >Devilfish</a> lurking in the shadows - and open a UMS drop box you find there\
      \ for a <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat\
      \ Assault Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a>. Collect the CAR then swim to the\
      \ jetty and climb out. Go along to the end of the jetty near the grassy area\
      \ you entered the water from to find steps back up to the waterside path.\n\
      </p><p>Follow the footpath along, past the end of the grassy path you entered\
      \ this area by, and you will find a covered footpath that leads into the village\
      \ square you passed earlier. If necessary first take a detour to grab a Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit from the end of the waterside path, then enter the village square.\n\
      </p><p>As you enter the village square, doors open on a balcony to the right\
      \ and a Nali runs out with a cry of fear. It jumps down and runs across the\
      \ square, hotly pursued by an angry SkaarjScout, and opens the door of a small\
      \ house, taking refuge inside. Intercept the Skaarj with your <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\"\
      \ title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>. When the Skaarj is dead, the Nali will\
      \ summon you.\n</p><p>Enter the house and follow the Nali's gesticulation. He\
      \ points you into a room with a lever and a window out to the small area you\
      \ saw blocked off by barse earlier. Press the lever and the bars open. Leave\
      \ the Nali's house and go round to the left. You will be back at the junction\
      \ by the hay bales. Follow round once again to the grassy path, and enter the\
      \ now open area. It's a small yard with a hay cart on which there is a UMS drop\
      \ box, a Nali Healing Fruit and a slanting ladder. Open the drop box for a 50\
      \ bullet CAR Clip, then climb the ladder. You arrive on a balcony above the\
      \ waterfront footpath.\n</p><p>Go to the left along the balcony. You will find\
      \ a door into the building from which the Nali fled. Kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ lurking within but don't go inside yet. If you go to the other end of the\
      \ balcony, you will find another door into the barn which is locked. Go to half\
      \ way along the balcony. You will see that you can walk along the top of a dividing\
      \ wall and climb steps to get on to the roof of the Nali's house. Do so. From\
      \ there, you will see a UMS drop box on the roof of the building from which\
      \ the Nali fled, but don't go up there yet.\n</p><p>Jump across from the roof\
      \ of the Nali's house on to the roof of the barn. On top of the roof, you will\
      \ find a large hole leading inside which you can drop through. Watch out for\
      \ a nasty <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"Manta\">Giant Manta</a> prowling around\
      \ up here.\n</p><p>Go inside the barn and go down to ground level. There, a\
      \ Nali lies dead on the floor with his diary nearby, between two UMS drop boxes\
      \ [2].\n</p><p>Open the two drop boxes. It's a bit of a treasure trove from\
      \ your point of view - you will find a box of 10 Rockets (Rocket Launcher ammo)\
      \ and a useful <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket\
      \ Launcher</a>. I would advise that you steer clear of using it for the confined\
      \ spaces of the village though. Once you have collected the gear, press a lever\
      \ in the corner to remove the bars from the exit. Go outside and find the ladder\
      \ back up onto the balcony. Climb it and return to the roof of the Nali's house.\
      \ This time, hop up on to the roof of the building from which the Nali fled.\
      \ Open the UMS drop box up there to collect the 50 bullet CAR Clip it reveals.\
      \ Go to the far end of this level of the roof.\n</p><p>At the end, go down the\
      \ slope of the roof towards the lake (don't fall off). Look along to the left\
      \ when you reach the bottom snd you will see that a narrow section of roof continues\
      \ along-side the wall of the taller part of the building. Follow this section\
      \ of the roof to the end; there, you will see a cave entrance in the cliff.\
      \ Hop through the entrance, follow the short cave, and drop down the hole at\
      \ the far end.\n</p><p>You are in the underground Nali hideout referred to by\
      \ a diary in the previous map. There, three Nali and a Nali Priest pace around\
      \ the cave and pray, while another Nali meditates by four further Nali who are\
      \ sleeping. Collect a set of Bandages from by the beds, then go to a table at\
      \ one side of the cave which has on it three Bandages and a diary [3].\n</p><p>Before\
      \ leaving, open a barrel by the table for a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a>. From the table,\
      \ go to the left, entering a small stone corridor. Climb steps within the corridor\
      \ and press a lever there; the roof of the corridor opens, allowing you to climb\
      \ out into the room above. Beware the nasty [[Skaarj Warrior|SkaarjAssassin]\
      \ lurking in a corner in said room.\n</p><p>You are on the ground floor of the\
      \ building from which the Nali fled. Up on the walkways above, the doors out\
      \ towards the lake are open whilst the others - the ones through which the Nali\
      \ fled - are shut. There are five Bandages by the stairs you just came up should\
      \ you need them. Go to the back of this room - the corner where the Skaarj was\
      \ lurking - and press the lever there. The doors through which the Nali fled\
      \ on to the balcony above the village square are now open. Climb one of the\
      \ flights of stairs to the upper level and go out through these doors. You will\
      \ see that doors at the other end of the balcony have opened too.\n</p><p>Cross\
      \ the balcony and enter the building beyond. As you enter, a bookcase is pushed\
      \ off the raised area to the left as a SkaarjAssassin bounds down and shuts\
      \ you in. Kill the Skaarj. Descend the steps in this room. If you need health,\
      \ shoot the table beneath the steps to pieces to get to the four Bandages underneath.\
      \ Once on the ground floor, you will find that the door out to the village square\
      \ is blocked by further fallen bookcases. So, go through a doorway near the\
      \ bottom of the stairs. One short corridor later, and you are in an extension\
      \ of the library where two <a href=\"/Krall\" title=\"Krall\">Krall</a> and\
      \ a <a href=\"/Krall\" title=\"Krall\">KrallElite</a> are playing dice. Interrupt\
      \ their game with a secondary fire <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a>\
      \ attack.\n</p><p>Go through the doors beyond where the Krall were crouching.\
      \ You come out on a paved road with a Nali statue and a UMS drop box ahead.\
      \ Destroy the drop box for a Health Pack. Look in both directions along the\
      \ road; to the left, the road continues off between houses. A Nali summons you\
      \ from a balcony above. To the right, the road ends at a lever. Go and activate\
      \ the lever to open a gate back to the village square, then turn around and\
      \ go along beneath the balcony / bridge where the Nali stands and head off between\
      \ the houses.\n</p><p>The road shortly turns round to the left. Turn the corner\
      \ and kill the <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjInfantry</a>\
      \ with a Stinger who comes running from a distance and collect the Stinger it\
      \ drops. Following the road, you will find a barrel on the right that contains\
      \ an ASMD Core. Beyond the barrel, between the houses, is a Nali Healing Fruit.\n\
      </p><p>Go on up the road. You will pass a doorway on the left, and further along\
      \ a familiar broken house on the right, coming eventually to a small Nali house.\
      \ Go inside.\n</p><p>There are four Bandages in here. When you've taken what\
      \ you need (there's nothing upstairs), leave the house and backtrack to the\
      \ doorway in the wall. Going through, you will emerge back in the open area\
      \ with the broken bridge in the middle, but on the other side of the obstruction.\
      \ Go to the right here and look through doors into a small room. Beware a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ that jumps down from the upper level. Once the Skaarj is dead, climb the ladder\
      \ and look across the broken bridge. The door at the far side is locked. Go\
      \ to the left on the upper level in this room and press a lever you find there.\
      \ Returning to the doorway, you will see that the doors at the other end of\
      \ the broken bridge are now open, and that the Nali who saw you on the other\
      \ bridge has come through and is still summoning you from beyond.\n</p><p>Cross\
      \ the collapsed bridge and enter the building. The Nali leads you out and across\
      \ the other bridge, into another small building beyond, where he stands facing\
      \ a door on the level below. Follow him into the last building but beware a\

      \nGlathriel Village harbour seemed surprisingly free of Skaarj. Now, as you\
      \ drop into a strange crypt-like underground cellar, you find it dangerously\
      \ infested with voracious spider-like creatures.\n\nYou start in the cobweb-laden\
      \ crypt, on the floor below the hole through which you dropped to exit the previous\
      \ level. To either side in this small area are shelves, and ahead the crypt\
      \ opens out into a wider space.\n\nReady your Grenade Launcher. Set off towards\
      \ the area ahead. As you approach, you will hear a sharp hiss and you will see\
      \ a Spinner lurking in a dark alcove to the right. The Spinner will not come\
      \ towards you, so blow it up at your leisure. Step out into the central area,\
      \ where there is a tomb in the middle of a small hub room. There, another Spinner\
      \ will see you. This one comes scuttling towards you, so try and avoid its acid\
      \ attacks and fangs. Kill it.\n\nStart straight across the crypt. You will enter\
      \ another offshoot much like the one in which you started. In this offshoot,\
      \ you will find that the first bottom shelf on the left contains a [[Seed|Nali\
      \ Fruit Seed]], a Flak Shell and an ASMD Core. Collect the gear. Return to the\
      \ main crypt and go to the right, arriving at the far end. There, two Spinners\
      \ will sight you from the corridor with the staircase ahead while two more will\
      \ come from further offshoots on either side. Kill all four.\n\nBefore leaving\
      \ via the staircase corridor, raid the remaining offshoots. In the offshoot\
      \ to the left, the back left shelf contains two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards\
      \ and a Nali Fruit Seed. The back left shelf of the final offshoot contains\
      \ two further clisters of 40 Tarydium Shards.\nReturn to the crypt. If you want\
      \ you can push on the end of the tomb to open it, but it reveals nothing of\
      \ gaming value. Head instead up the corridor with the steps and enter the area\
      \ at the far end.\n\nThe area you are now in is a main crypt hall with two minor\
      \ halls on either side. Go past the first minor hall and look down the main\
      \ hall; a Spinner attacks from the far end. Kill it. Then, enter the far minor\
      \ hall and kill the Spinner there. Go along the minor hall. Remove vases in\
      \ the way in an alcove to the left then collect from said alcove a set of [[Bandages]],\
      \ a box of 50 Bullets and two Flak Shells.\n\nGo to the main hall and along\
      \ to the arches at the end. Go through the arches into the next small area,\
      \ where there are four doorways. The door to the right and the two doors ahead\
      \ each go into small tomb rooms, with a chest in each. Two of said chests reveal\
      \ a set of Bandages each. When you're done with the chests, go through the fourth\
      \ doorway, which leads to a staircase upwards. Climb the staircase to enter\
      \ a small hallway lit by lamp stands. Follow the hallway along and go through\
      \ a doorway at the far end, and you come out inside a church where a [[Nali]]\
      \ Priest prays by a dead Nali on an altar.\n\nAs you approach the altar, a window\
      \ above shatters and a [[Skaarj Warrior|SkaarjScout]] leaps in through it, much\
      \ to the terror of the Nali. Try to kill the Skaarj without harming the Nali\
      \ - the Nali will still be afraid of you but at least he'll be alive. There's\
      \ a UMS drop box by the altar. Open it for a pack of 10 Grenades. Then, read\
      \ a diary the Nali Priest (who has probably scarpered) has left on the altar\
      \ beside the dead body [1].\n\nWhen you're done, go to the double doors at the\
      \ far end of the church and step outside.\n\nYou are in a small garden outside\
      \ the church. Looking back at the church, you will see two barrels and an exit\
      \ from the garden. Shoot the barrels open for two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards,\
      \ then go through the exit from the garden. You come out in another garden area\
      \ where a [[Manta]] swoops towards you from the right. Kill it, then go into\
      \ its corner for a [[Nali Healing Fruit]]. When you're done, return to the dirt\
      \ path through the garden and follow it down towards the houses.\n\nThe way\
      \ is blocked in that area by a stack of hay bales. You can get past the blockage\
      \ by jumping up the slanting hay bale. If you have trouble with that, you can\
      \ go to a rock further along to the left and use it to jump over the garden\
      \ wall, but you'll land right in front of a Skaarj.\n\nOnce over the bales,\
      \ there are various ways to go. A grass path leads you to the right, while there's\
      \ a small village square ahead and a pathed path to the left. First, go down\
      \ the paved path. The path shortly turns a corner to the right into an open\
      \ area guarded by a [[Skaarj Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]. Kill the Skaarj. Here,\
      \ you will see that the open area is blocked by a collapsed wooden bridge between\
      \ two buildings. Turn around and return to the junction. Go to the right at\
      \ the junction, past the hay bales, and onto the grassy path. Follow the path,\
      \ collecting a Nali Healing Fruit on the way if you need it, until you reach\
      \ a doorway to a small courtyard on the left. You will find that it is blocked\
      \ by bars.\n\nGo to the far end of the footpath. You come out on a paved lakeside\
      \ path. Ahead, the water stretches off a little way into the dark, with a long\
      \ jetty running parallel to the footpath. Go along the path to the right. You\
      \ will find a doorway back into one of the buildings (some kind of barn) is\
      \ also blocked by bars. A grassy area at the end of the path reveals nothing,\
      \ so take a dip into the lake. Go to the back of the lake - beware two strong\
      \ [[Devilfish]] lurking in the shadows - and open a UMS drop box you find there\
      \ for a [[Combat Assault Rifle]]. Collect the CAR then swim to the jetty and\
      \ climb out. Go along to the end of the jetty near the grassy area you entered\
      \ the water from to find steps back up to the waterside path.\n\nFollow the\
      \ footpath along, past the end of the grassy path you entered this area by,\
      \ and you will find a covered footpath that leads into the village square you\
      \ passed earlier. If necessary first take a detour to grab a Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ from the end of the waterside path, then enter the village square.\n\nAs you\
      \ enter the village square, doors open on a balcony to the right and a Nali\
      \ runs out with a cry of fear. It jumps down and runs across the square, hotly\
      \ pursued by an angry SkaarjScout, and opens the door of a small house, taking\
      \ refuge inside. Intercept the Skaarj with your [[Flak Cannon]]. When the Skaarj\
      \ is dead, the Nali will summon you.\n\nEnter the house and follow the Nali's\
      \ gesticulation. He points you into a room with a lever and a window out to\
      \ the small area you saw blocked off by barse earlier. Press the lever and the\
      \ bars open. Leave the Nali's house and go round to the left. You will be back\
      \ at the junction by the hay bales. Follow round once again to the grassy path,\
      \ and enter the now open area. It's a small yard with a hay cart on which there\
      \ is a UMS drop box, a Nali Healing Fruit and a slanting ladder. Open the drop\
      \ box for a 50 bullet CAR Clip, then climb the ladder. You arrive on a balcony\
      \ above the waterfront footpath.\n\nGo to the left along the balcony. You will\
      \ find a door into the building from which the Nali fled. Kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ lurking within but don't go inside yet. If you go to the other end of the\
      \ balcony, you will find another door into the barn which is locked. Go to half\
      \ way along the balcony. You will see that you can walk along the top of a dividing\
      \ wall and climb steps to get on to the roof of the Nali's house. Do so. From\
      \ there, you will see a UMS drop box on the roof of the building from which\
      \ the Nali fled, but don't go up there yet.\n\nJump across from the roof of\
      \ the Nali's house on to the roof of the barn. On top of the roof, you will\
      \ find a large hole leading inside which you can drop through. Watch out for\
      \ a nasty [[Manta|Giant Manta]] prowling around up here.\n\nGo inside the barn\
      \ and go down to ground level. There, a Nali lies dead on the floor with his\
      \ diary nearby, between two UMS drop boxes [2].\n\nOpen the two drop boxes.\
      \ It's a bit of a treasure trove from your point of view - you will find a box\
      \ of 10 Rockets (Rocket Launcher ammo) and a useful [[Rocket Launcher]]. I would\
      \ advise that you steer clear of using it for the confined spaces of the village\
      \ though. Once you have collected the gear, press a lever in the corner to remove\
      \ the bars from the exit. Go outside and find the ladder back up onto the balcony.\
      \ Climb it and return to the roof of the Nali's house. This time, hop up on\
      \ to the roof of the building from which the Nali fled. Open the UMS drop box\
      \ up there to collect the 50 bullet CAR Clip it reveals. Go to the far end of\
      \ this level of the roof.\n\nAt the end, go down the slope of the roof towards\
      \ the lake (don't fall off). Look along to the left when you reach the bottom\
      \ snd you will see that a narrow section of roof continues along-side the wall\
      \ of the taller part of the building. Follow this section of the roof to the\
      \ end; there, you will see a cave entrance in the cliff. Hop through the entrance,\
      \ follow the short cave, and drop down the hole at the far end.\n\nYou are in\
      \ the underground Nali hideout referred to by a diary in the previous map. There,\
      \ three Nali and a Nali Priest pace around the cave and pray, while another\
      \ Nali meditates by four further Nali who are sleeping. Collect a set of Bandages\
      \ from by the beds, then go to a table at one side of the cave which has on\
      \ it three Bandages and a diary [3].\n\nBefore leaving, open a barrel by the\
      \ table for a [[Super Health Pack]]. From the table, go to the left, entering\
      \ a small stone corridor. Climb steps within the corridor and press a lever\
      \ there; the roof of the corridor opens, allowing you to climb out into the\
      \ room above. Beware the nasty [[Skaarj Warrior|SkaarjAssassin] lurking in a\
      \ corner in said room.\n\nYou are on the ground floor of the building from which\
      \ the Nali fled. Up on the walkways above, the doors out towards the lake are\
      \ open whilst the others - the ones through which the Nali fled - are shut.\
      \ There are five Bandages by the stairs you just came up should you need them.\
      \ Go to the back of this room - the corner where the Skaarj was lurking - and\
      \ press the lever there. The doors through which the Nali fled on to the balcony\
      \ above the village square are now open. Climb one of the flights of stairs\
      \ to the upper level and go out through these doors. You will see that doors\
      \ at the other end of the balcony have opened too.\n\nCross the balcony and\
      \ enter the building beyond. As you enter, a bookcase is pushed off the raised\
      \ area to the left as a SkaarjAssassin bounds down and shuts you in. Kill the\
      \ Skaarj. Descend the steps in this room. If you need health, shoot the table\
      \ beneath the steps to pieces to get to the four Bandages underneath. Once on\
      \ the ground floor, you will find that the door out to the village square is\
      \ blocked by further fallen bookcases. So, go through a doorway near the bottom\
      \ of the stairs. One short corridor later, and you are in an extension of the\
      \ library where two [[Krall]] and a [[Krall|KrallElite]] are playing dice. Interrupt\
      \ their game with a secondary fire [[Stinger]] attack.\n\nGo through the doors\
      \ beyond where the Krall were crouching. You come out on a paved road with a\
      \ Nali statue and a UMS drop box ahead. Destroy the drop box for a Health Pack.\
      \ Look in both directions along the road; to the left, the road continues off\
      \ between houses. A Nali summons you from a balcony above. To the right, the\
      \ road ends at a lever. Go and activate the lever to open a gate back to the\
      \ village square, then turn around and go along beneath the balcony / bridge\
      \ where the Nali stands and head off between the houses.\n\nThe road shortly\
      \ turns round to the left. Turn the corner and kill the [[Skaarj Trooper|SkaarjInfantry]]\
      \ with a Stinger who comes running from a distance and collect the Stinger it\
      \ drops. Following the road, you will find a barrel on the right that contains\
      \ an ASMD Core. Beyond the barrel, between the houses, is a Nali Healing Fruit.\n\
      \nGo on up the road. You will pass a doorway on the left, and further along\
      \ a familiar broken house on the right, coming eventually to a small Nali house.\
      \ Go inside.\n\nThere are four Bandages in here. When you've taken what you\
      \ need (there's nothing upstairs), leave the house and backtrack to the doorway\
      \ in the wall. Going through, you will emerge back in the open area with the\
      \ broken bridge in the middle, but on the other side of the obstruction. Go\
      \ to the right here and look through doors into a small room. Beware a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ that jumps down from the upper level. Once the Skaarj is dead, climb the ladder\
      \ and look across the broken bridge. The door at the far side is locked. Go\
      \ to the left on the upper level in this room and press a lever you find there.\
      \ Returning to the doorway, you will see that the doors at the other end of\
      \ the broken bridge are now open, and that the Nali who saw you on the other\
      \ bridge has come through and is still summoning you from beyond.\n\nCross the\
      \ collapsed bridge and enter the building. The Nali leads you out and across\
      \ the other bridge, into another small building beyond, where he stands facing\
      \ a door on the level below. Follow him into the last building but beware a\
      \ SkaarjTrooper with a [[Dispersion Pistol]] that attacks him from the right.\
      \ When the Skaarj is dead, go down to the lower level and into the field beyond.\
      \ Visit the left and right corners at this end of the field for three Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit. Then, cross the field and approach the cave entrance at the far end.\n\
      \nThe cave tunnel you enter takes you round a bend and into a larger cave where\
      \ you will be unpleasantly surprised by a [[Skaarj Trooper|SkaarjOfficer]] with\
      \ an [[ASMD]]. Kill it and collect the ASMD it drops then enter the cave properly.\
      \ About half way through the cave, a fence with a gap in it marks a small drop.\
      \ Jump through the gap to exit the level.\n\n== Translator messages ==\n#\"\
