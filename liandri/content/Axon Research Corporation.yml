      \ <b>Axon Research Corporation</b> is one of the four known major corporations\
      \ in the Unreal universe. While <a href=\"/Liandri\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Liandri\">Liandri</a> is primarily concerned with mining and its Tournament,\
      \ <a href=\"/Izanagi\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Izanagi\">Izanagi</a> with\
      \ whatever makes money, and <a href=\"/Phayder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Phayder\">Phayder</a>'s motives are unknown, Axon is heavily invested in much\
      \ scientific and technological research. While generally presented as the \"\
      good\" corporation (or, perhaps, the least \"bad\"), Axon is not above direct\
      \ assault and theft of competing corporations' research and developments such\
      \ as the <a href=\"/Ion_Tank\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ion Tank\">Ion\
      \ Tank</a> on <a href=\"/AS-Glacier\" title=\"AS-Glacier\">AS-Glacier</a>. They\
      \ are a large weapons supplier for the <a href=\"/NEG\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"NEG\">NEG</a> for some time and later Liandri's Tournament. However,\
      \ in the years following UT2004, Liandri has apparently intimidated Axon to\
      \ the point of being capable of running them out of some facilities like <a\

      </p><p>Axon Research Corporation is the only major corporation which has no\

      mw-redirect\" title=\"TCA\">TCA</a>, for defense, apparently in return for the\
      \ research and weaponry they supply. The closest thing to a military team Axon\

    text: "[[Image:Axon_Banner.PNG|right|thumb|150px|The banner of the Axon Corporation]]\n\
      The '''Axon Research Corporation''' is one of the four known major corporations\
      \ in the Unreal universe. While [[Liandri]] is primarily concerned with mining\
      \ and its Tournament, [[Izanagi]] with whatever makes money, and [[Phayder]]'s\
      \ motives are unknown, Axon is heavily invested in much scientific and technological\
      \ research. While generally presented as the \"good\" corporation (or, perhaps,\
      \ the least \"bad\"), Axon is not above direct assault and theft of competing\
      \ corporations' research and developments such as the [[Ion Tank]] on [[AS-Glacier]].\
      \ They are a large weapons supplier for the [[NEG]] for some time and later\
      \ Liandri's Tournament. However, in the years following UT2004, Liandri has\
      \ apparently intimidated Axon to the point of being capable of running them\
      \ out of some facilities like [[DM-AxonCompressor]].\n\nAxon Research Corporation\
      \ is the only major corporation which has no known military or mercenary force\
      \ under its direct control. Axon seems to rely on the NEG and its child organization,\
      \ the [[TCA]], for defense, apparently in return for the research and weaponry\
      \ they supply. The closest thing to a military team Axon has is its [[Juggernaut]]\
      \ program.\n\n==Military units==\nAxon is not known to have its own military\
      \ or mercenary forces, but it does sponsor several teams in Liandri's events.\n\
      \n===Teams Juggernauts and Goliath===\nAxon Corporation sponsors both [[geneboosted]]\
      \ teams in Liandri's Tournament, the [[Juggernauts]] and [[Goliath (team)|Goliath]].\
      \ Axon first started with the former team; after winning a Tournament championship\
      \ with its captain [[Gorge]], Axon fielded the second team in hopes of an all-Juggernaut\
      \ final round. It is not clear if Axon itself is responsible for the existence\
      \ of the genetically modified Juggernauts or not, even though they sponsor the\
      \ teams in Liandri's events.\n\n===Team Marauders===\nAxon fielded Gorge with\
      \ a new team of Juggernauts, the [[Marauders]], in Liandri's [[Nakhti Ascension\
      \ Rites]] Championship. The Corporation designed new armor for the team in return\
      \ for a percentage of their winnings.\n\n==Vehicles==\nAxon created the original\
      \ nine vehicles in Liandri's [[Onslaught]] gametype. In Onslaught, both teams\
      \ fielded the same array of vehicles. However, in [[UT3]], a full complement\
      \ [[Necris]]-built vehicles will be available.\n\nAxon's vehicles are:\n* [[Manta]]\n\
      * [[Scorpion]]\n* [[Hellbender]]\n* [[Paladin]]\n* [[Goliath]]\n* [[SPMA]]\n\
      * [[Leviathan]]\n* [[Raptor]]\n* [[Cicada]]\n\n==Involvement==\n===Unreal 2===\n\
      In Unreal 2, Axon is among the four factions competing for the [[Artifacts]],\
      \ fighting against Liandri, Izanagi, and the [[Skaarj]]. Before the conflict\
      \ over their possession began, Axon had recovered three of the seven artifacts,\
      \ which were being researched on two separate worlds.\n\n====Hell====\nOn [[Hell]],\
      \ Axon had been studying the effects of the unique radiation and other physical\
      \ properties of one of the Artifacts on various unintelligent creatures at the\
      \ [[Elysium Weapons Research Facility]]. An accident allowed a massive number\
      \ of [[Araknids]] to enter the radiation, causing a mutation which increased\
      \ their size, aggressiveness, and lethalness. The entire facility was overran\
      \ by the araknids, killing every scientist in the lab. The situation was brought\
      \ under control by [[John Dalton]], who infiltrated the facility, destroyed\
      \ the araknid queen, and recovered the artifact.\n\n====Janus====\nScientists\
      \ on [[Janus]]' [[Polaris]] research base, led by [[Minor characters in Unreal\
      \ 2|Dr. Meyer]], were performing similar experiments and testing on two artifacts.\
      \ However, the facility was ambushed by Izanagi [[Ghost Warriors]], who were\
      \ looking to steal the two artifacts. Dalton arrived soon enough to save Meyer\
      \ from the torture he was enduring and cleanse the facility of the Izanagi invaders.\
      \ Before the two could escape with the two Artifacts, [[Liandri Angels]] assaulted\
      \ the facility and destroyed the exit. Dalton led Meyer to the roof, clearing\
      \ the way of Angels, and then defended against several Liandri assaults with\
      \ [[NEG]] Marine help while Meyer established communications with the orbiting\
      \ [[TCA Atlantis]]. \n\nAfter the incident, Dr. Meyer was secretly smuggled\
      \ off-world by Dalton due to orders to terminate non-military personnel and\
      \ gave the two artifacts to his crew.\n\n===UT2004===\n====AS-Glacier====\n\
      [[AS-Glacier]] is an example of Axon's willingness to do whatever is necessary\
      \ to further their research, even assault and theft. In 2260, during the [[Corporation\
      \ Wars]], Axon staged an assault against the Izanagi facility on [[Lamdon 3]]\
      \ to steal the prototype [[Ion Tank]] and destroy the base. Curiously enough,\
      \ though Axon had sided with the NEG merely 10 years before against the Izanagi,\
      \ the base was defended not by Ghost Warriors but by the NEG's elite [[ThunderCrash]]\
      \ squad. The Axon assault was a huge success on their part.\n\n====Teams Juggernaut\
      \ and Goliath====\nAxon Corporation sponsors both geneboosted teams in Liandri's\
      \ Tournament, the Juggernauts and Goliath.\n\n====Vehicles====\nAxon supplied\
      \ Liandri's Onslaught vehicular combat event with six (later expanded to nine)\
      \ vehicles ranging from a gigantic mobile assault station to a nimble fighter\
      \ aircraft. The vehicles continued to be used in the follower of the Onslaught\
      \ event, [[Warfare]].\n\n===UT3=== \n====Team Juggernaut====\nEarly on it was\
      \ reported that Axon's primary team, the Juggernauts, will once again make an\
      \ appearance in Liandri's Tournament. However, recent news indicates the possibility\
      \ that the Juggernauts have been dropped from the Tournament.\n\n====Vehicles====\n\
      Axon again supplies the vehicles for Liandri's Tournament, this time for its\
      \ Warfare event. While the same roster of nine vehicles is used, most of the\
      \ vehicles have received upgrades in suspension, steering, weaponry, and in\
      \ some cases, seating arrangements.\n\n===UC2=== \n====Team Marauders====\n\
      Axon fielded Gorge with a new team of Juggernauts, the Marauders, in Liandri's\
      \ Nakhti Ascension Rites Championship.\n\n====DM-AxonCompressor====\nThe [[Deathmatch]]\
      \ map [[DM-AxonCompressor]] used in the Championship was an Axon energy facility.\
      \ The facility was abandoned when Liandri forces arrived, and while it is not\
      \ made clear whether or not this occured because Liandri arrived, it is strongly\
      \ implied.\n\n====DM-Morbias3====\n{{QuoteSource|Axon's painstaking remake of\
