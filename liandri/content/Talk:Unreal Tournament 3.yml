      \ UT3Patch3beta3.exe.</li>\n<li>Engine Version is just that - the engine version\
      \ number. Older UTs used these numbers for the version number, but UT3 does\
      \ not. Interestingly to note is that the last UT2004 version (3369) is not far\
      \ off from the demo of UT3 (3464)... so it seems like Epic did not re-enumerate\
      \ the engine as many had thought they would.</li>\n<li>Reported Version Number\
      \ is what version the game lists itself as in the main menu of the upper left\
      \ corner. As stated, the demo and release versions of the game do not have a\
      \ reported version number.</li></ul></dd>\n<dd>Hopefully that clears up the\

      \ 07:54, 10 August 2007 (EDT)\n\n== Release date ==\n\nSource? I thought the\

      \ is confirmed and official, then [http://www.beyondunreal.com/content/articles/168_1.php\

      \ attemption to capture gets \"Denied\", but I've heard \"Denied!\" whenever\
      \ I've killed an Enemy Orb Carrier in close proximity to a friendly node during\

      \ to state \"III\", is this official? --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 10:42,\
      \ 20 June 2008 (EDT)\n\nThe logo is the only thing that states \"III\". The\
      \ game's folders, desktop icon and the game's website all use a 3. --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]]\
      \ 11:57, 20 June 2008 (EDT)\n:OK, then it's good. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 12:10, 20 June 2008 (EDT)\n\n==Popularity In The PC Market==\nIs there any\
      \ point to the second paragraph of this section other than to conjecture that\
      \ UT2004 is more popular than UT3? Also, I'm not sure that it's wise to have\
      \ data that fluctuates this often on the two pages this section appears on.\
      \ --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 10:00, 21 June 2008 (EDT)\n\nI'm not sure why\
      \ this section even exists. The information will always be outdated because\
      \ it will always be changing. The general idea is already covered under the\
      \ Reception header. Speaking of which, a lot of the wording is not very neutral\
      \ (for example: Astoundingly bad Server Admin launch) or is based in opinion\
      \ (for example: Awkward and simple UI, Lackluster Single-Player). At the very\
      \ least, specific quotes and links should be provided to quality reviews of\
      \ the game to support the speculation. --[[User:Hal|Hal]] 12:58, 24 November\
      \ 2008 (EST)\n\n== Necrified versions of WAR-DownTown & VCTF-Suspense? ==\n\n\
      Could someone who has the 360 version of UT3 please confirm the mapnames? The\
      \ ones I've put in the article are, for now, logical guesses, based on how Epic\
      \ named the Necrified versions of maps such as WAR-TorlanNecris and VCTF-SerenityNecris.\
      \ Please correct them if they're indeed wrong. --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark Pulse]]\
      \ 08:27, 11 July 2008 (EDT)\n\n== Versions? ==\n\nWhat's with all those confusions\
      \ with the versions? Game version number, reported version number, Engine version\
      \ number... Why aren't they called normally as they did from earlier? Unreal\
      \ is 226/227, UT is 436, UT2004 is 3369... Why did they change that? --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 15:12, 11 July 2008 (EDT)\n\n:Because Epic decided to abandon that and doesn't\
      \ name UT3 versions by the engine number anymore. :p Here's the gist:\n:*Game\
      \ Version is the actual patch version. In this case, Patch 3 Beta 3 is named...\
      \ surprisingly... UT3Patch3beta3.exe.\n:*Engine Version is just that - the engine\
      \ version number. Older UTs used these numbers for the version number, but UT3\
      \ does not. Interestingly to note is that the last UT2004 version (3369) is\
      \ not far off from the demo of UT3 (3464)... so it seems like Epic did not re-enumerate\
      \ the engine as many had thought they would.\n:*Reported Version Number is what\
      \ version the game lists itself as in the main menu of the upper left corner.\
      \ As stated, the demo and release versions of the game do not have a reported\
      \ version number.\n:Hopefully that clears up the confusion. You don't have UT3,\
      \ so I could see why this would seem confusing to you. --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark\
      \ Pulse]] 07:21, 12 July 2008 (EDT)\n\n::Well, Epic never renumbered it in the\
      \ past, why would they do it now? v11056 FTW :D Maybe it will eventually reach\
      \ this version, in Unreal IV or something! --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 14:43, 12 July 2008 (EDT)\n\n:::By Re-numerate, I meant large version skips.\
      \ UT launched at 400 from Unreal's 226. (Well, it wasn't 226 at the time UT\
      \ launched, but you get my point.) 2k3 started at 1077 compared to UT's 436\
      \ and in one patch jumped nearly 1000 levels to 2225. UT2004 did the same thing,\
      \ jumping nearly 1000 to 3186 for its launch and finishing at 3369. The \"Re-numeration\"\
      \ I meant was that most people assumed that UT3's engine numbers would start\
      \ in the 4000s and they didn't. :p --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark Pulse]] 13:43, 13\
      \ July 2008 (EDT)\n\n::::UT starts from 230 actually. Just that then it was\
      \ a closed alpha. You can even find some classes using checks like this to determine\
      \ what game it is: \"if version > 230\". And Unreal started all the way from\
      \ the start (100-200 for Beta, earlier for Tech Demo). And also you forgot Unreal\
      \ II: they started at 821. Not too much of a gap. Though UT2004 does have it.\
      \ --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 14:33, 13 July 2008 (EDT)\n\n: Third\
      \ party games started at the revision when they licensed the engine. --[[User:Sir\
      \ Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 18:23, 19 July 2008 (EDT)\n\n== Music list ==\n\nCan someone\
      \ update the music list with the actual UT3 music list? You can use tools such\
      \ as [http://utforums.epicgames.com/showthread.php?t=602058 this] to see the\
      \ music names and even extract the music for listening :) As currently the music\
      \ list doesn't give too much of useful information... --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 16:59, 8 October 2008 (EDT)\n\n==Easter Eggs==\n\nI'm not sure but there really\
      \ aren't any easter eggs in UT3. I know it's not the most important thing but\
      \ in almost every other Unreal game there have been at least a few. --[[User:Jet\
      \ v4.3.5|Jet v4.3.5]] 10:02 AM, May 2, 2009\n\n== Maps: Started the remaining\
      \ articles. ==\n\nWell, I've added the articles for the remaining maps of the\
      \ game, with their SP info, but not the info about pickups, weapons, and, in\
      \ many cases, vehicles. I'll be doing the same later for UT2004 and UT. If someone\
      \ wants to finish them (and the remaining articles) with the remaining and additional\
      \ info, then do it.--[[User:Neon Knight|Neon_Knight]] 12:39, 28 March 2010 (EDT)"
