      /DM-Phobos\" title=\"DM-Phobos\">DM-Phobos</a> and <a href=\"/DM-HyperBlast\"\
      \ title=\"DM-HyperBlast\">DM-HyperBlast</a>, <b>DM-Deimos</b> is a mixed-gravity\
      \ arena that takes place on an orbiting station above the planet <a href=\"\
      /edit/Taryd?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Taryd (page does not exist)\"\
      >Taryd</a>.\n</p><p>The gameplay takes place both inside and outside the station.\
      \ The gravity is substantially reduced while outside, similar to the <a href=\"\
      /UT2004\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UT2004\">UT2004</a> versions of Phobos\
      \ and HyperBlast. The gravity zones are differentiated by non-solid force-fields\
      \ that are red from the outside and green from the inside. \n</p><p>A small\
      \ shuttle allows teleport access to a distant platform which contains an Energy\
      \ <a href=\"/Turrets\" title=\"Turrets\">Turret</a> normally found in <a href=\"\
      /VCTF\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"VCTF\">VCTF</a> or <a href=\"/Warfare\"\
      \ title=\"Warfare\">Warfare</a>. The Turret is fairly powerful, and has a good\
      \ view of many combat areas on the side of the station it faces. Operators can\
      \ be sniped out of the Turret with the <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper\
      \ Rifle\">Sniper Rifle</a>, located on the map's highest point, accessible via\
      \ two zero-gravity tubes that allow players to swim up and down them. The Turret\
      \ is also in range of almost every other weapon on the map, but can be devastating\
      \ nonetheless.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Visuals\">Visuals</span><span\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Deimos is visually\
      \ stunning, certainly. It resembles DM-Phobos, on the surface, a roughly conical\
      \ space station with a central pit and surrounding hallways, as well as lowered\
      \ platforms on the left and right, but the similarity is largely superficial.\
      \ It contains a few elements of DM-HyperBlast, among them the horse-shoe shaped\
      \ tunnel arcing outward from the main body of the map, and the general feel\
      \ of the upper low gravity areas (with the middle section bumped up and two\
      \ lower areas on either side).\n</p><p>The station is in high orbit above Taryd,\
      \ and the planet is visible when looking in the direction of the Turret. The\
      \ Jumpgate looms on the other side, sporting a dark black and red palette. The\
      \ sun to the right (facing the Turret) casts a strong highlight on passing asteroids.\n\
      </p><p>By and large it uses the tech texture sets, and is similar to maps like\
      \ <a href=\"/DM-CarbonFire\" title=\"DM-CarbonFire\">DM-CarbonFire</a> or the\
      \ bases in <a href=\"/WAR-Torlan\" title=\"WAR-Torlan\">WAR-Torlan</a>, for\
      \ example. The Necris influence is present, however, and a few Necris tentacles\
      \ can be found here and there, snaking along its hull.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ of the zero-gravity passages required to access the Redeemer, Jumpboots and\
      \ Health Keg is one that drops down along the back (considering the Turret side\
      \ the front) of the arena and ends up facing the Turret. \n</p><p>The low-gravity\
      \ outside means that you can easily be knocked off the station and plummet to\
      \ your death if you get shot while in the air or near a ledge by a weapon with\

      \ visuals, combined with the inclusion of the Turret, and the low-gravity fighting\
      \ have caused some critics to decry the quality of the gameplay, but it remains\

      \ changed the face of interstellar life. Now, the constant traffic of trade,\

      \ ==\nTechnically intended as a combination of [[DM-Phobos]] and [[DM-HyperBlast]],\
      \ '''DM-Deimos''' is a mixed-gravity arena that takes place on an orbiting station\
      \ above the planet [[Taryd]].\n\nThe gameplay takes place both inside and outside\
      \ the station. The gravity is substantially reduced while outside, similar to\
      \ the [[UT2004]] versions of Phobos and HyperBlast. The gravity zones are differentiated\
      \ by non-solid force-fields that are red from the outside and green from the\
      \ inside. \n\nA small shuttle allows teleport access to a distant platform which\
      \ contains an Energy [[Turrets|Turret]] normally found in [[VCTF]] or [[Warfare]].\
      \ The Turret is fairly powerful, and has a good view of many combat areas on\
      \ the side of the station it faces. Operators can be sniped out of the Turret\
      \ with the [[Sniper Rifle]], located on the map's highest point, accessible\
      \ via two zero-gravity tubes that allow players to swim up and down them. The\
      \ Turret is also in range of almost every other weapon on the map, but can be\
      \ devastating nonetheless.\n\n===Visuals===\nDeimos is visually stunning, certainly.\
      \ It resembles DM-Phobos, on the surface, a roughly conical space station with\
      \ a central pit and surrounding hallways, as well as lowered platforms on the\
      \ left and right, but the similarity is largely superficial. It contains a few\
      \ elements of DM-HyperBlast, among them the horse-shoe shaped tunnel arcing\
      \ outward from the main body of the map, and the general feel of the upper low\
      \ gravity areas (with the middle section bumped up and two lower areas on either\
      \ side).\n\nThe station is in high orbit above Taryd, and the planet is visible\
      \ when looking in the direction of the Turret. The Jumpgate looms on the other\
      \ side, sporting a dark black and red palette. The sun to the right (facing\
      \ the Turret) casts a strong highlight on passing asteroids.\n\nBy and large\
      \ it uses the tech texture sets, and is similar to maps like [[DM-CarbonFire]]\
      \ or the bases in [[WAR-Torlan]], for example. The Necris influence is present,\
      \ however, and a few Necris tentacles can be found here and there, snaking along\
      \ its hull.\n\n== Weapons & Pickups ==\n===Weapons===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\

      \ See Strategy.\n|-\n|}\n\n== Strategy ==\nThe longer version of the zero-gravity\
      \ passages required to access the Redeemer, Jumpboots and Health Keg is one\
      \ that drops down along the back (considering the Turret side the front) of\
      \ the arena and ends up facing the Turret. \n\nThe low-gravity outside means\
      \ that you can easily be knocked off the station and plummet to your death if\
      \ you get shot while in the air or near a ledge by a weapon with sufficient\
      \ knock-back, like a [[Shock Rifle]] or [[Rocket Launcher]]. The slower, \"\
      floatier\" movement makes [[hitscan]] weaponry, like the Shock Rifle, Sniper\
      \ Rifle and Stinger Minigun much more potent outside, but allows for some creative\
      \ trick-jumps, like a double-jump wall-dodge from the Body [[Armor]] tunnel\
      \ to the [[UDamage]] above. Jump Boots can also cover serious distance in low-gravity\
      \ areas.\n\nSome areas feature a darker green transparent surface, which is\
      \ most prominently featured near the [[Shield Belt]] and Rocket Launcher spawn\
      \ area. These surfaces are solid to players, but non-solid to weapon fire.\n\
      \nAnother instance of the above surface appears between the Redeemer spawn platform\
      \ and the [[Flak Cannon]] spawn above, allowing for attempts to deny someone\
      \ access to the Redeemer, or blind hail Mary shots up into the Flak room for\
      \ some lucky kills with the super weapon.\n\nThe impressive visuals, combined\
      \ with the inclusion of the Turret, and the low-gravity fighting have caused\
      \ some critics to decry the quality of the gameplay, but it remains fun for\
      \ more casual matches, or Instant Action matches against bots.\n\n== Campaign\
      \ Info ==\n{{QuoteSource|We won the battle, but Akasha slipped through the gate\
      \ and the necris are shutting it down. N.E.G. battle-cruisers are inbound to\
      \ enforce the cease-fire, so we've only got a few minutes before this war 'officially'\
      \ ends. But unofficially, this shit 'aint over until *I* say it's over. We are\
      \ taking over this station, hijacking a ship, and going through that jump-gate\
      \ to find Akasha.|Briefing|UT3}}\n\nThe alliances that Izanagi made with [[Axon]]\
      \ and [[Liandri]] caused the Phayder to act out of desperation and launch a\
      \ full-scale war, which has drawn the attention of the [[NEG]].  When [[Reaper]]\
      \ reaches this map in the Campaign, he is chasing [[Akasha]] after her over-ambitious\
      \ [[Necris]] invasion force was pushed back by the intercession of the NEG military\
      \ forces.\n\nWhile the Izanagi Corporation is happy to let the Necris go and\
      \ enjoy the new territory they won from the Axon and Liandri during the conflict,\
      \ Reaper rallies his team into a revenge strike against the Necris and Akasha.\
      \ He fights the Necris off of the Deimos station and hijacks a shuttle which\
      \ he takes through the nearby Jumpgate and into [[Phayder]] controlled space;\
      \ a decision which causes the Izanagi to disavow any association with the Ronin,\
      \ and a decision which has tragic consequences for the wayward squad down the\
      \ road.\n\n=== Mission Objectives ===\n* Keep enemies in check until their Respawner\
      \ charges are depleted.\n* Access the laser turret by teleporting to the orbiting\
      \ shuttlecraft.\n* Erratic shifts in gravity are common in this region of space.\n\
      \n=== Voice Chat ===\n(At the beginning of the match)\n\n'''[[Reaper]]:''' ''Learn\
      \ the layout quickly.  Let's use the terrain to our advantage.''<br>\n'''[[Othello]]:'''\
      \ ''This place is crazy! Low-grav, slow zones...''<br>\n'''[[Jester]]:''' ''A\

      \  Might want to watch that first step...''<br>\n'''[[Jester]]:''' ''Your body\

      \n'''[[Reaper]]:''' ''We need someone on that turret ASAP, look for a teleporter.''<br>\n\
