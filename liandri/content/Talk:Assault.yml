      \ Archives is for the players.  I suppose the players don't need to know the\
      \ actual names of the objective-related actors, but it certainly makes sense\
      \ for there to be a description of the objectives and it doesn't make a whole\
      \ lot of sense to call them by a name that's different than the actor's.  The\
      \ Construction part could be simplified into a statement like \"Assault maps\
      \ are difficult to make, so there arent' very many of them\" but I don't think\
      \ it's going to deter or put off anyone to see a short explanation of why that\
      \ is.  And I think it's important to have a list of the maps.  I don't think\
      \ that redundancy is necessarily a bad thing.  I like that I can go to a page\
      \ about Assault and see everything about it there at once, for the same reason\
      \ that I like to go to a page about UT2004 and see all the maps for it listed\
      \ there.  Nothing I put on the page except for the names of the Assault actors\
      \ is at all technical, so I guess I'm just not understanding your point here\
      \ or we have different ideas of how simplified this wiki should be.  Change\
