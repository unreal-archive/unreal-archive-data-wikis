      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After the horrors of <a href=\"/Rrajigar_Mine\" title=\"\
      Rrajigar Mine\">Rrajigar Mine</a>, a return to the surface was welcome; and\
      \ now, with yourself still reeling from the mines as you enter this Nali temple,\
      \ it seems so peaceful; you are intelligent enough however to realise that this\
      \ is unlikely to last, so you keep your wits about you.\n</p><p>You are sealed\
      \ into the temple now, so the only way to go is onwards. You begin just beyond\
      \ the antechamber of the entrance, so follow the corridor through to the next\
      \ big room, collecting an <a href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Automag\">Automag</a> on the way.\n</p><p>You will arrive at a room with a pool\
      \ in the middle. Circumnavigating the pool you will find 3 Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ if you need them, plus the corpse of a Slith. If you enter the corridor at\
      \ the far end of the room, you will see that it turns into a vertical shaft\
      \ that is barred off. Return to the pool.\n</p><p>Remember \"Wood must break\
      \ free ... for that will be the key.\"? Well, the switch above the pool is out\
      \ of reach. Step on to the wooden platform chained to the floor of the pool.\
      \ Use the Automag to shoot the four chains holding it in place to break them,\
      \ and the wood will surface, allowing you to jump and head-butt the switch.\
      \ When activated, the switch will move chains that open the bars blocking the\
      \ vertical shaft. When it is open, take a leap of faith.\n</p><p>You will arrive\
      \ at an alcove above another water pool. Collect the Clip and the <a href=\"\
      /Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flare</a>, then take a look into the dark at the back\
      \ of the alcove. There is a sleeping <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScout</a> here - so take him out with your\
      \ <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> secondary fire. He'll be\
      \ half dead before he's even awake.\n</p><p>Drop into the pool. Two <a href=\"\
      /Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a> will ambush you here, so Automag\
      \ them. Having done that, collect the Stinger and Tarydium Shards from the bottom\
      \ of the pool. There are <a href=\"/Biterfish\" title=\"Biterfish\">Biterfish</a>\
      \ here but they don't harm you. Collect also if you need it the Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit on the pool floor near the alcove.\n</p><p>At the bottom of the pool,\
      \ opposite the alcove, there is a tunnel. Follow it; there is a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit here if you need it; and surface in a small room where a <a href=\"\
      /Tentacle\" title=\"Tentacle\">Tentacle</a> is often found sniping at you. Kill\
      \ the Tentacle and shoot open the vases and wooden chest to get two Clips, a\
      \ Flare and a very useful replacement <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\"\
      >Flashlight</a>. There is also an ASMD Core loose on the floor up for collection.\n\
      </p><p>Return to the main pool and use the broken beams to climb up on to a\
      \ platform near the ceiling. In the corridor to the right, a Nali Priest will\
      \ summon you. Follow him - go via the loose stones if you want to collect a\
      \ Clip - until he opens an alcove with Flares and Tarydium Shards at the far\
      \ end. Collect what you need, then return to the corridor and look to the left.\n\
      </p><p>A lift is located in an alcove. Press the outset stone on the door frame,\
      \ and the lift will descend. Stand on the lift and you will be taken up to another\
      \ room with 4 alcoves and a water feature.\n</p><p>Collect the <a href=\"/ASMD\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a> from the water feature in the\
      \ centre of the room, and break all of the vases in the room to reveal 2 Clips.\
      \ The water contains nothing but a few harmless Biterfish, so ignore it.\n</p><p>Press\
      \ the outset stone in the first alcove clockwise from the lift. The floor opens\
      \ and you drop down into a small chamber. Sometimes a Tentacle greets you here,\
      \ so kill it. Collect what you require of the 2 Clips and Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ here, then press the middle outset stone of the effigy that is to the right\
      \ as you drop in. The gold door ahead will open, allowing you access to the\
      \ next part of the temple.\n</p><p>Pass through the door and go down the steps\
      \ ahead. Bars block the way through to a Nali who is in a frenzy of worship.\
      \ An inscription is on the right [1].\n</p><p>Can't go this way yet then. If\
      \ you need to, collect the two Nali Healing Fruit here, and shoot the vases\
      \ open to get 2 Clips. Return up the steps and go round to the left.\n</p><p>Follow\
      \ the walkway until a narrow corridor turns off to the right. Follow it, jumping\
      \ over obstacles and dislodging them where appropriate. Soon you will reach\
      \ a Nali Priest who calls for you to follow him over a bridge, but watch out\
      \ for a <a href=\"/Slith\" title=\"Slith\">Slith</a> behind which will most\
      \ likely jump off the bridge, but may come for the Nali. If it does so, take\
      \ it out with the ASMD before it can kill the Nali.\n</p><p>Now follow the Nali\
      \ - collecting a Clip on the way - and it will lead you to a blocked entrance\
      \ and two informative inscriptions [2,3].\n</p><p>Only one way to go now; kill\
      \ the Slith that jumped off the bridge and its friend in the water below, then\
      \ jump off yourself and land in the water. As you kill the Slith, a plank comes\
      \ out crossing the gap between an inscription at the pool edge and a small pillar\
      \ in the middle. Climb out of the juice and read the inscription [4].\n</p><p>Walk\
      \ the plank and press the small carved pillar of a face. It sinks into its pedestal,\
      \ and bars open revealing an exit from the pool. Well, it seems that you have\
      \ \"touched the face of the water god idol\", so maybe you can get into the\
      \ main temple now.\n</p><p>Before leaving, there are three Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ in and around the water that you may wish to collect. Do so if you want, then\
      \ head up the corridor.\n</p><p>There are Tarydium Shards here but beware; as\
      \ you move along the corridor a stream of arrows fires down the centre. Avoid\
      \ these and step up on to the lift at the far end (collect Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ from either side of doorway by the lift if you need to).\n</p><p>Take the\
      \ lift up and you will reach a corridor where another Nali Priest summons you.\
      \ Ignore him for now and go along the corridor to the next room. A stream of\
      \ <a href=\"/Fly\" title=\"Fly\">Flies</a> comes down from above that might\
      \ otherwise have attacked the Nali; Automag them, then return to the Nali. He\
      \ will lead you back into the room and gesticulate at an outset stone on the\
      \ wall.\n</p><p>Vases in this room reveal a Clip, so collect it (there's also\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit by the outset stone), then press the outset stone. A\
      \ pillar in the opposite corner will descend; step aboard it and ride it to\
      \ the corridor above, where there is another Nali Healing Fruit and Tarydium\
      \ Shards. At the far end of said corridor, a wall will open returning you to\
      \ the room with the four alcoves and water feature.\n</p><p>Note: If you have\
      \ had any Nali casualties then a SkaarjScout may be lurking behind the moving\
      \ wall. If you didn't meet one up here, then you will meet one beyond the gold\
      \ door. However it happens, there will be a SkaarjScout you have to fight.\n\
      </p><p>Return to the room with the stairs down that were barred off before.\
      \ Kill any Skaarj here and descend the steps. Descending the steps, you will\
      \ see that the corridor at the bottom is broken by an opening and closing pit\
      \ in the floor. A useful item can be found down there, so drop down while the\
      \ slabs are open.\n</p><p>In the water below, take a right and follow the underwater\
      \ tunnel to the far end. Surface up the vertical shaft to a small area with\
      \ two sets of Tarydium Shards. Go back down into the tunnel and surface at the\
      \ next verttical shaft half way along, where there are more Tarydium Shards\
      \ and a box of 50 Bullets.\n</p><p>Take the other underwater tunnel out of the\
      \ area where you dropped in to get a very useful <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a>. Return to where you dropped\
      \ in, as the vertical shafts reveal nothing. Surface and you will see a small\
      \ cubby-hole with a button and a lift shaft. Summon the lift using the button\
      \ and ride it up to a small attic corridor containing two ASMD Cores, and push\
      \ the stone out at the end to return to the top of the sanctum stairs.\n</p><p>That\
      \ little diversion complete, return to the bottom of the stairs and jump this\
      \ time over the small pit you went down before (mind the Nali). You will arrive\
      \ on a wooden platform. Take a right (mind the Slith that comes down from the\
      \ far end) and enter the small antechamber.\n</p><p>Upon entering the chamber,\
      \ watch out for the Fly that comes down from above. Destroy it and step into\
      \ the chamber, but beware the wooden pole which swings round and can damage\
      \ you if you're not careful. Vases in this room reveal nothing useful, but there\
      \ are Nali Healing Fruits here that you may find useful. When you are done,\
      \ return down the wooden walkway and go along to another antechamber where there\
      \ is another pole trap and another Fly. Vases here reveal a Flare.\n</p><p>Take\
      \ the other wooden walkway now, but stop half way between the two antechambers\
      \ where a sealed door is on the left. Press the outset stone in the middle of\
      \ the wall opposite to open the door. Going through the door you are sometimes\
      \ attacked by a Slith. Dispose of the Slith then read the log of the corpse\
      \ on the floor [5].\n</p><p>Proceed down the corridor until you reach a junction\
      \ with a water feature ahead. First things first, jump on to the loose stone\
      \ and from there to the <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> on top of the feature. If\
      \ you fall in the water, climb out and try again.\n</p><p>Take the route that\
      \ was to the left as you entered the junction. It doubles back, so take a right\
      \ when it opens out and enter the next room. As you turn the corner you will\
      \ be greeted by a Slith. Kill it without hurting the Nali behind.\n</p><p>As\
      \ you descend the ramp from where you came in, the aforementioned Nali Priest\
      \ will see you and be afraid. Ignore him, and continue round the wooden walkway.\
      \ When you reach a slightly larger platform before a ramp upwards, three Flies\
      \ will descend from the open roof. Shoot them down.\n</p><p>Climb the ramp and\
      \ kill the Slith that meets you at the top. Go past a dead Nali with a knife,\
      \ and down the ramp through a doorway. You will find a dead human on the walkway\
      \ below with an ASMD. Continuing down, you will find a room with a hydraulic\
      \ tank in the middle and an ASMD Core. Collect the core then shoot the barrel\
      \ under the ramp to get a box of 50 Bullets.\n</p><p>Time for a useful hidden\
      \ area. Shoot the wall to the right of the barrel and it opens. Go through the\
      \ revealed entrance into a small cubby-hole, where you will find an inscription\
      \ [6].\n</p><p>The cubby-hole continues to the right. Follow it through and\
      \ you will arrive at the top of a deep pit with a central pillar. A green bar\
      \ goes out and follows round above the pit below. Step on to the beam and use\
      \ it to go round behind the pillar. Beyond, you will see a mirror on the back\
      \ of the central pillar. Floating in the gap between the beam and the pillar\
      \ is a Shield Belt. Do what the inscription says; stand directly facing the\
      \ mirror then walk forwards off the beam. You will not fall down the pit. Get\
      \ the belt and return to the beam, then go back round and return to the room\
      \ with the hydraulic tank.\n</p><p>Shortcut: A quick route to the holy altar\
      \ of the stick of 6 fires is to press the lever on the hydraulic tank and return\
      \ to the top of the ramp in the main room. A platform will arrive; step aboard\
      \ to chug to a gold door on a balcony below, which accesses a later part of\
      \ the level (go to §).\n</p><p>Otherwise, you need now to return to the junction\
      \ where the Super Health Pack was. Go either by the way you came or by the water;\
      \ kill the Slith sometimes found swimming here and drop in. On the floor of\
      \ the pool near where you came in is an entrance in the floor with Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit. Follow the tunnel until you arrive at a large underwater room, then\
      \ swim up until you reach the base of the water feature at the junction. In\
      \ doing so you will attract the attention of two Devilfish so kill them.\n</p><p>Take\
      \ now the other route from the junction, i.e. the one that was to the right\
      \ as you came down the entrance corridor. As you round the corner some Tentacles\
      \ will attack you. There's an inscription nearby [7].\n</p><p>Drop into the\
      \ water ahead until you reach a collection of loose stones acting as a kind\
      \ of staircase. Jump up the stones via Tarydium Shards on the way until you\
      \ reach the top one, then jump across to the stone ahead on which there is an\
      \ ASMD Core.\n</p><p>Entering the next room you will see a dead human with a\
      \ Flare, a Stinger and a knife. Take his Stinger then descend the wooden ramp.\
      \ A Nali Priest will see you and run away; ignore him. You will soon reach a\
      \ platform with a dead SkaarjWarrior; from here look over to the right. You\
      \ should see a SkaarjScout standing up by some blue torches; you're no fool,\
      \ so try and kill him whilst saving the Nali. Head over to the gold door on\
      \ the left. It does not open. There's another inscription [8].\n</p><p>A nearby\
      \ alcove is also walled off, so return to the wooden walkway and take the left\
      \ in the direction of the two blue torches.\n</p><p>Each of the two pillars\
      \ with blue torches on has an outset stone. Press both. The wooden platforms\
      \ in this area also yield two ASMD Cores and four Nali Healing Fruit.\n</p><p>Drop\
      \ into the water here, keeping on the lookout for the Devilfish that patrol\
      \ this pool. Head over to the support for the first lightning fire pillar, where\
      \ there is a raised area with barrels that yield an ASMD Core and a Flashlight.\
      \ There are also two Nali Healing Fruit in the water beneath this area, so take\
      \ them if you need to.\n</p><p>Jump back into the juice and head to the other\
      \ part of the pool. There are more Devilfish here and some further Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit; there is also a tantalising-looking entrance in the floor but it only\
      \ leads you back to the Super Health Pack junction.\n</p><p>Climb the wooden\
      \ ramp out of the water and enter the new alcove beside the gold door where\
      \ there are two ASMD Cores and a button. Press the button and the gold door\
      \ opens. As you approach the open door though a Slith will attack from beyond.\
      \ ASMD Combo it, staying behind the door. Collect any more ASMD Cores you need,\
      \ then re-open the door if it has shut and continue through.\n</p><p>You will\
      \ emerge in a small hallway with an open space on the left and a gold door on\
      \ the right. I advise against going through the gold door at this stage, so\
      \ head instead out into the open area on the left. You will see an Eightball\
      \ Gun on a pillar over water, but it is inaccessible so don't try to reach it.\
      \ This is the holy altar of the stick of 6 fires.\n</p><p>As you enter this\
      \ open area another Slith will attack from the far side, so dispatch it. Don't\
      \ jump into the water yet, instead go on to the wooden platform over the water\
      \ and read the blue inscription at this end of the holy altar [9].\n</p><p>Moving\
      \ along the platform you will see two barred openings on either side of the\
      \ room. Read now the pink inscription at the far end [10].\n</p><p>§ At this\
      \ end of the area there is another hallway, this time with just one Slith. A\
      \ gold door to one side is a way back to earlier in the level, so go instead\
      \ through the end door, into another room with wooden platforms and water. A\
      \ small flat-topped pyramid is at the far end. Kill the two Flies that attack\
      \ you here, and dispose of the two Tentacles that snipe from under the walkways.\
      \ Read the white inscription at the far end [11].\n</p><p>So, jump on to the\
      \ pyramid's centre, which presses down, and bale out on to the wooden walkway.\
      \ Lightning will strike the pyramid and blast a hole in the wall. Climb the\
      \ fallen plank, pass through the short corridor revealed and enter the next\
      \ chamber.\n</p><p>Your arrival in the chamber of death will wake a SkaarjScout\
      \ who will attack you. Kill it then take a look around. There are three crucified\
      \ Nali; put them out of their misery with ASMD secondary fire. Now, move over\
      \ to the raised dais and collect the four cans of 12 Eightballs (<a href=\"\
      /Eightball_Gun\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eightball Gun\">Eightball Gun</a>\
      \ ammo). That done, return to the pyramid room.\n</p><p>Take this opportunity\
      \ to dive into the water here. First, explore the upper area of the water, collecting\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit from alcoves on the pyramid and Tarydium Shards from the\
      \ floor of the upper pool. Venture into the deeper section (breathe first!),\
      \ where a short tunnel leads off to one side. This tunnel contains two barrels\
      \ and another tantalising hole in the floor, but don't explore it yet as you\
      \ would probably drown.\n</p><p>Take a detour at this point, and swim out of\
      \ the pipe into the large pool beneath the stick of 6 fires. Ignore the tunnel\
      \ to the right as it is just another route to the Super Health Pack junction,\
      \ instead heading to the short underwater tunnel at the end, where barrels by\
      \ Nali corpses contain two ASMD Cores. Return to the pyramid room, climb out\
      \ of the drink, and head back out to the holy altar.\n</p><p>Travel to the far\
      \ end of the holy altar area, beyond the blue inscription. You will arrive at\
      \ the gold door you haven't yet been through. Opening said door, you will see\
      \ two Nali praying and meditating at what must be the obelisk of the clouds.\
      \ This part is tricky, because as you enter two Slith will come forwards and\
      \ attack the Nali. Kill the slith and collect the Nali Healing Fruit from the\
      \ base of the obelisk; investigating the corners of the room will also reveal\
      \ a box of 50 Bullets and a corpse with an ASMD. Read the inscriptions on the\
      \ obelisk [12-15].\n</p><p>Take the tunnel that was on the LEFT as you entered\
      \ and kill the Slith there. Follow the waterway, collecting a box of 50 Bullets\
      \ from a corner on the way, until you reach a set of loose stones. Climb the\
      \ stones and collect the Tarydium Shards as you go, until you reach a corridor\
      \ to a large pool.\n</p><p>Skirt the pool, passing meditating Nali Priests on\
      \ the way, and read the two inscriptions [16,17].\n</p><p>Did they? Anyway,\
      \ climb the steps and collect the ASMD Cores from behind the pillars at the\
      \ top. Enter the waterfall to get a Super Health Pack.\n</p><p>You are now ready\
      \ to face whatever demon the game might throw at you, so take the plunge into\
      \ the pool of thunder. There will be a crash of thunder, and a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ will drop down from a hole in the ceiling at the far end of the corridor.\
      \ Use ASMD primary fire to kill the Skaarj then make sure that you have collected\
      \ the <a href=\"/SCUBA_Gear\" title=\"SCUBA Gear\">SCUBA Gear</a> from the bottom\
      \ of the pool. Collect any further ASMD Cores you require from behind the pillars,\
      \ then return down the corridor to the waterway.\n</p><p>From the loose stones,take\
      \ a left and duck into the inner corner as the waterway goes round. You will\
      \ see a concealed entrance in the floor (pictured). Take a dip - the SCUBA Gear\
      \ will activate automatically - and follow the tunnel. You will find a box of\
      \ 50 Bullets, and further along two Nali Healing Fruit, two ASMD Cores and a\
      \ Kevlar Suit. The tunnel continues in a vertical shaft but it's a dead end,\
      \ so don't waste the SCUBA gear. Return to the hole and surface. Return past\
      \ the obelisk of the clouds to the holy altar, where one previously barred opening\
      \ is now accessible.\n</p><p>Extra: Return to the pyramid room and dive down\
      \ so that you reach the hole in the floor that you didn't go down earlier. Now\
      \ that you have the SCUBA gear, you can do it without risk of drowning.\nThe\
      \ barrel at the very bottom of the vertical shaft is empty, so take a turn part\
      \ of the way down into a horizontal shaft where there is a Devilfish. At the\
      \ crossroads, straight ahead and to the left are dead ends, so turn right, where\
      \ another Devilfish will attack. This is a dead end too but there is a vertical\
      \ shaft that goes up and down; down has a barrel with an ASMD Core. Up leads\
      \ to a room where you can surface to meet two Tentacles. Dispatching the Tentacles\
      \ you can retrieve an Assault Vest and shoot a barrel to get Tarydium Shards.\
      \ Collect what you need and return to the holy altar.\n</p><p>At the holy altar,\
      \ go to the newly opened alcove.\n</p><p>Within the alcove are a lever and two\
      \ inscriptions [18,19].\n</p><p>Press the lever and a ramp rises to the Eightball\
      \ Gun so that you can collect it. Do so. Now... the ceremonial chambers... remember\
      \ that stone seal earlier? Well, no need to retrace all your steps bacause the\
      \ remaining bars open to reveal a gold door that creates a shortcut.\n</p><p>Go\
      \ through the door and follow the wooden platforms round to a Skaarj teleporter.\
      \ Here a Nali will take fright and head through the teleport; take the teleport\
      \ yourself but try not to telefrag him.\nYou will appear right by the entrance\
      \ to the Ceremonial Chambers. Ignore the SkaarjWarrior who charges from behind,\
      \ and leap straight through the now open stone seal to exit the level.\n</p>\n\

      \ absorbed by the sounds of running water, frogs, ethereal Nali drums and the\
      \ crackling torches that adorn the temple's waterlogged passageways. All seems\
      \ peaceful, but the temple has in fact been overrun by serpentine [[Slith]]\
      \ monstrosities. Raised on holy altar and seemingly inaccessible lies the mythical\
      \ [[Eightball Gun|Stick of Six Fires]], a powerful alien weapon.\n{{clear}}\n\

      \n\n==Walkthrough==\nAfter the horrors of [[Rrajigar Mine]], a return to the\
      \ surface was welcome; and now, with yourself still reeling from the mines as\
      \ you enter this Nali temple, it seems so peaceful; you are intelligent enough\
      \ however to realise that this is unlikely to last, so you keep your wits about\
      \ you.\n\nYou are sealed into the temple now, so the only way to go is onwards.\
      \ You begin just beyond the antechamber of the entrance, so follow the corridor\
      \ through to the next big room, collecting an [[Automag]] on the way.\n\nYou\
      \ will arrive at a room with a pool in the middle. Circumnavigating the pool\
      \ you will find 3 Nali Healing Fruit if you need them, plus the corpse of a\
      \ Slith. If you enter the corridor at the far end of the room, you will see\
      \ that it turns into a vertical shaft that is barred off. Return to the pool.\n\
      \nRemember \"Wood must break free ... for that will be the key.\"? Well, the\
      \ switch above the pool is out of reach. Step on to the wooden platform chained\
      \ to the floor of the pool. Use the Automag to shoot the four chains holding\
      \ it in place to break them, and the wood will surface, allowing you to jump\
      \ and head-butt the switch. When activated, the switch will move chains that\
      \ open the bars blocking the vertical shaft. When it is open, take a leap of\
      \ faith.\n\nYou will arrive at an alcove above another water pool. Collect the\
      \ Clip and the [[Flare]], then take a look into the dark at the back of the\
      \ alcove. There is a sleeping [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScout]] here\
      \ - so take him out with your [[Stinger]] secondary fire. He'll be half dead\
      \ before he's even awake.\n\nDrop into the pool. Two [[Devilfish]] will ambush\
      \ you here, so Automag them. Having done that, collect the Stinger and Tarydium\
      \ Shards from the bottom of the pool. There are [[Biterfish]] here but they\
      \ don't harm you. Collect also if you need it the Nali Healing Fruit on the\
      \ pool floor near the alcove.\n\nAt the bottom of the pool, opposite the alcove,\
      \ there is a tunnel. Follow it; there is a Nali Healing Fruit here if you need\
      \ it; and surface in a small room where a [[Tentacle]] is often found sniping\
      \ at you. Kill the Tentacle and shoot open the vases and wooden chest to get\
      \ two Clips, a Flare and a very useful replacement [[Flashlight]]. There is\
      \ also an ASMD Core loose on the floor up for collection.\n\nReturn to the main\
      \ pool and use the broken beams to climb up on to a platform near the ceiling.\
      \ In the corridor to the right, a Nali Priest will summon you. Follow him -\
      \ go via the loose stones if you want to collect a Clip - until he opens an\
      \ alcove with Flares and Tarydium Shards at the far end. Collect what you need,\
      \ then return to the corridor and look to the left.\n\nA lift is located in\
      \ an alcove. Press the outset stone on the door frame, and the lift will descend.\
      \ Stand on the lift and you will be taken up to another room with 4 alcoves\
      \ and a water feature.\n\nCollect the [[ASMD]] from the water feature in the\
      \ centre of the room, and break all of the vases in the room to reveal 2 Clips.\
      \ The water contains nothing but a few harmless Biterfish, so ignore it.\n\n\
      Press the outset stone in the first alcove clockwise from the lift. The floor\
      \ opens and you drop down into a small chamber. Sometimes a Tentacle greets\
      \ you here, so kill it. Collect what you require of the 2 Clips and Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit here, then press the middle outset stone of the effigy that is to the\
      \ right as you drop in. The gold door ahead will open, allowing you access to\
      \ the next part of the temple.\n\nPass through the door and go down the steps\
      \ ahead. Bars block the way through to a Nali who is in a frenzy of worship.\
      \ An inscription is on the right [1].\n\nCan't go this way yet then. If you\
      \ need to, collect the two Nali Healing Fruit here, and shoot the vases open\
      \ to get 2 Clips. Return up the steps and go round to the left.\n\nFollow the\
      \ walkway until a narrow corridor turns off to the right. Follow it, jumping\
      \ over obstacles and dislodging them where appropriate. Soon you will reach\
      \ a Nali Priest who calls for you to follow him over a bridge, but watch out\
      \ for a [[Slith]] behind which will most likely jump off the bridge, but may\
      \ come for the Nali. If it does so, take it out with the ASMD before it can\
      \ kill the Nali.\n\nNow follow the Nali - collecting a Clip on the way - and\
      \ it will lead you to a blocked entrance and two informative inscriptions [2,3].\n\
      \nOnly one way to go now; kill the Slith that jumped off the bridge and its\
      \ friend in the water below, then jump off yourself and land in the water. As\
      \ you kill the Slith, a plank comes out crossing the gap between an inscription\
      \ at the pool edge and a small pillar in the middle. Climb out of the juice\
      \ and read the inscription [4].\n\nWalk the plank and press the small carved\
      \ pillar of a face. It sinks into its pedestal, and bars open revealing an exit\
      \ from the pool. Well, it seems that you have \"touched the face of the water\
      \ god idol\", so maybe you can get into the main temple now.\n\nBefore leaving,\
      \ there are three Nali Healing Fruit in and around the water that you may wish\
      \ to collect. Do so if you want, then head up the corridor.\n\nThere are Tarydium\
      \ Shards here but beware; as you move along the corridor a stream of arrows\
      \ fires down the centre. Avoid these and step up on to the lift at the far end\
      \ (collect Nali Healing Fruit from either side of doorway by the lift if you\
      \ need to).\n\nTake the lift up and you will reach a corridor where another\
      \ Nali Priest summons you. Ignore him for now and go along the corridor to the\
      \ next room. A stream of [[Fly|Flies]] comes down from above that might otherwise\
      \ have attacked the Nali; Automag them, then return to the Nali. He will lead\
      \ you back into the room and gesticulate at an outset stone on the wall.\n\n\
      Vases in this room reveal a Clip, so collect it (there's also a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit by the outset stone), then press the outset stone. A pillar in the opposite\
      \ corner will descend; step aboard it and ride it to the corridor above, where\
      \ there is another Nali Healing Fruit and Tarydium Shards. At the far end of\
      \ said corridor, a wall will open returning you to the room with the four alcoves\
      \ and water feature.\n\nNote: If you have had any Nali casualties then a SkaarjScout\
      \ may be lurking behind the moving wall. If you didn't meet one up here, then\
      \ you will meet one beyond the gold door. However it happens, there will be\
      \ a SkaarjScout you have to fight.\n\nReturn to the room with the stairs down\
      \ that were barred off before. Kill any Skaarj here and descend the steps. Descending\
      \ the steps, you will see that the corridor at the bottom is broken by an opening\
      \ and closing pit in the floor. A useful item can be found down there, so drop\
      \ down while the slabs are open.\n\nIn the water below, take a right and follow\
      \ the underwater tunnel to the far end. Surface up the vertical shaft to a small\
      \ area with two sets of Tarydium Shards. Go back down into the tunnel and surface\
      \ at the next verttical shaft half way along, where there are more Tarydium\
      \ Shards and a box of 50 Bullets.\n\nTake the other underwater tunnel out of\
      \ the area where you dropped in to get a very useful [[Assault Vest]]. Return\
      \ to where you dropped in, as the vertical shafts reveal nothing. Surface and\
      \ you will see a small cubby-hole with a button and a lift shaft. Summon the\
      \ lift using the button and ride it up to a small attic corridor containing\
      \ two ASMD Cores, and push the stone out at the end to return to the top of\
      \ the sanctum stairs.\n\nThat little diversion complete, return to the bottom\
      \ of the stairs and jump this time over the small pit you went down before (mind\
      \ the Nali). You will arrive on a wooden platform. Take a right (mind the Slith\
      \ that comes down from the far end) and enter the small antechamber.\n\nUpon\
      \ entering the chamber, watch out for the Fly that comes down from above. Destroy\
      \ it and step into the chamber, but beware the wooden pole which swings round\
      \ and can damage you if you're not careful. Vases in this room reveal nothing\
      \ useful, but there are Nali Healing Fruits here that you may find useful. When\
      \ you are done, return down the wooden walkway and go along to another antechamber\
      \ where there is another pole trap and another Fly. Vases here reveal a Flare.\n\
      \nTake the other wooden walkway now, but stop half way between the two antechambers\
      \ where a sealed door is on the left. Press the outset stone in the middle of\
      \ the wall opposite to open the door. Going through the door you are sometimes\
      \ attacked by a Slith. Dispose of the Slith then read the log of the corpse\
      \ on the floor [5].\n\nProceed down the corridor until you reach a junction\
      \ with a water feature ahead. First things first, jump on to the loose stone\
      \ and from there to the [[Super Health Pack]] on top of the feature. If you\
      \ fall in the water, climb out and try again.\n\nTake the route that was to\
      \ the left as you entered the junction. It doubles back, so take a right when\
      \ it opens out and enter the next room. As you turn the corner you will be greeted\
      \ by a Slith. Kill it without hurting the Nali behind.\n\nAs you descend the\
      \ ramp from where you came in, the aforementioned Nali Priest will see you and\
      \ be afraid. Ignore him, and continue round the wooden walkway. When you reach\
      \ a slightly larger platform before a ramp upwards, three Flies will descend\
      \ from the open roof. Shoot them down.\n\nClimb the ramp and kill the Slith\
      \ that meets you at the top. Go past a dead Nali with a knife, and down the\
      \ ramp through a doorway. You will find a dead human on the walkway below with\
      \ an ASMD. Continuing down, you will find a room with a hydraulic tank in the\
      \ middle and an ASMD Core. Collect the core then shoot the barrel under the\
      \ ramp to get a box of 50 Bullets.\n\nTime for a useful hidden area. Shoot the\
      \ wall to the right of the barrel and it opens. Go through the revealed entrance\
      \ into a small cubby-hole, where you will find an inscription [6].\n\nThe cubby-hole\
      \ continues to the right. Follow it through and you will arrive at the top of\
      \ a deep pit with a central pillar. A green bar goes out and follows round above\
      \ the pit below. Step on to the beam and use it to go round behind the pillar.\
      \ Beyond, you will see a mirror on the back of the central pillar. Floating\
      \ in the gap between the beam and the pillar is a Shield Belt. Do what the inscription\
      \ says; stand directly facing the mirror then walk forwards off the beam. You\
      \ will not fall down the pit. Get the belt and return to the beam, then go back\
      \ round and return to the room with the hydraulic tank.\n\nShortcut: A quick\
      \ route to the holy altar of the stick of 6 fires is to press the lever on the\
      \ hydraulic tank and return to the top of the ramp in the main room. A platform\
      \ will arrive; step aboard to chug to a gold door on a balcony below, which\
      \ accesses a later part of the level (go to §).\n\nOtherwise, you need now to\
      \ return to the junction where the Super Health Pack was. Go either by the way\
      \ you came or by the water; kill the Slith sometimes found swimming here and\
      \ drop in. On the floor of the pool near where you came in is an entrance in\
      \ the floor with Nali Healing Fruit. Follow the tunnel until you arrive at a\
      \ large underwater room, then swim up until you reach the base of the water\
      \ feature at the junction. In doing so you will attract the attention of two\
      \ Devilfish so kill them.\n\nTake now the other route from the junction, i.e.\
      \ the one that was to the right as you came down the entrance corridor. As you\
      \ round the corner some Tentacles will attack you. There's an inscription nearby\
      \ [7].\n\nDrop into the water ahead until you reach a collection of loose stones\
      \ acting as a kind of staircase. Jump up the stones via Tarydium Shards on the\
      \ way until you reach the top one, then jump across to the stone ahead on which\
      \ there is an ASMD Core.\n\nEntering the next room you will see a dead human\
      \ with a Flare, a Stinger and a knife. Take his Stinger then descend the wooden\
      \ ramp. A Nali Priest will see you and run away; ignore him. You will soon reach\
      \ a platform with a dead SkaarjWarrior; from here look over to the right. You\
      \ should see a SkaarjScout standing up by some blue torches; you're no fool,\
      \ so try and kill him whilst saving the Nali. Head over to the gold door on\
      \ the left. It does not open. There's another inscription [8].\n\nA nearby alcove\
      \ is also walled off, so return to the wooden walkway and take the left in the\
      \ direction of the two blue torches.\n\nEach of the two pillars with blue torches\
      \ on has an outset stone. Press both. The wooden platforms in this area also\
      \ yield two ASMD Cores and four Nali Healing Fruit.\n\nDrop into the water here,\
      \ keeping on the lookout for the Devilfish that patrol this pool. Head over\
      \ to the support for the first lightning fire pillar, where there is a raised\
      \ area with barrels that yield an ASMD Core and a Flashlight. There are also\
      \ two Nali Healing Fruit in the water beneath this area, so take them if you\
      \ need to.\n\nJump back into the juice and head to the other part of the pool.\
      \ There are more Devilfish here and some further Nali Healing Fruit; there is\
      \ also a tantalising-looking entrance in the floor but it only leads you back\
      \ to the Super Health Pack junction.\n\nClimb the wooden ramp out of the water\
      \ and enter the new alcove beside the gold door where there are two ASMD Cores\
      \ and a button. Press the button and the gold door opens. As you approach the\
      \ open door though a Slith will attack from beyond. ASMD Combo it, staying behind\
      \ the door. Collect any more ASMD Cores you need, then re-open the door if it\
      \ has shut and continue through.\n\nYou will emerge in a small hallway with\
      \ an open space on the left and a gold door on the right. I advise against going\
      \ through the gold door at this stage, so head instead out into the open area\
      \ on the left. You will see an Eightball Gun on a pillar over water, but it\
      \ is inaccessible so don't try to reach it. This is the holy altar of the stick\
      \ of 6 fires.\n\nAs you enter this open area another Slith will attack from\
      \ the far side, so dispatch it. Don't jump into the water yet, instead go on\
      \ to the wooden platform over the water and read the blue inscription at this\
      \ end of the holy altar [9].\n\nMoving along the platform you will see two barred\
      \ openings on either side of the room. Read now the pink inscription at the\
      \ far end [10].\n\n§ At this end of the area there is another hallway, this\
      \ time with just one Slith. A gold door to one side is a way back to earlier\
      \ in the level, so go instead through the end door, into another room with wooden\
      \ platforms and water. A small flat-topped pyramid is at the far end. Kill the\
      \ two Flies that attack you here, and dispose of the two Tentacles that snipe\
      \ from under the walkways. Read the white inscription at the far end [11].\n\
      \nSo, jump on to the pyramid's centre, which presses down, and bale out on to\
      \ the wooden walkway. Lightning will strike the pyramid and blast a hole in\
      \ the wall. Climb the fallen plank, pass through the short corridor revealed\
      \ and enter the next chamber.\n\nYour arrival in the chamber of death will wake\
      \ a SkaarjScout who will attack you. Kill it then take a look around. There\
      \ are three crucified Nali; put them out of their misery with ASMD secondary\
      \ fire. Now, move over to the raised dais and collect the four cans of 12 Eightballs\
      \ ([[Eightball Gun]] ammo). That done, return to the pyramid room.\n\nTake this\
      \ opportunity to dive into the water here. First, explore the upper area of\
      \ the water, collecting Nali Healing Fruit from alcoves on the pyramid and Tarydium\
      \ Shards from the floor of the upper pool. Venture into the deeper section (breathe\
      \ first!), where a short tunnel leads off to one side. This tunnel contains\
      \ two barrels and another tantalising hole in the floor, but don't explore it\
      \ yet as you would probably drown.\n\nTake a detour at this point, and swim\
      \ out of the pipe into the large pool beneath the stick of 6 fires. Ignore the\
      \ tunnel to the right as it is just another route to the Super Health Pack junction,\
      \ instead heading to the short underwater tunnel at the end, where barrels by\
      \ Nali corpses contain two ASMD Cores. Return to the pyramid room, climb out\
      \ of the drink, and head back out to the holy altar.\n\nTravel to the far end\
      \ of the holy altar area, beyond the blue inscription. You will arrive at the\
      \ gold door you haven't yet been through. Opening said door, you will see two\
      \ Nali praying and meditating at what must be the obelisk of the clouds. This\
      \ part is tricky, because as you enter two Slith will come forwards and attack\
      \ the Nali. Kill the slith and collect the Nali Healing Fruit from the base\
      \ of the obelisk; investigating the corners of the room will also reveal a box\
      \ of 50 Bullets and a corpse with an ASMD. Read the inscriptions on the obelisk\
      \ [12-15].\n\nTake the tunnel that was on the LEFT as you entered and kill the\
      \ Slith there. Follow the waterway, collecting a box of 50 Bullets from a corner\
      \ on the way, until you reach a set of loose stones. Climb the stones and collect\
      \ the Tarydium Shards as you go, until you reach a corridor to a large pool.\n\
      \nSkirt the pool, passing meditating Nali Priests on the way, and read the two\
      \ inscriptions [16,17].\n\nDid they? Anyway, climb the steps and collect the\
      \ ASMD Cores from behind the pillars at the top. Enter the waterfall to get\
      \ a Super Health Pack.\n\nYou are now ready to face whatever demon the game\
      \ might throw at you, so take the plunge into the pool of thunder. There will\
      \ be a crash of thunder, and a SkaarjWarrior will drop down from a hole in the\
      \ ceiling at the far end of the corridor. Use ASMD primary fire to kill the\
      \ Skaarj then make sure that you have collected the [[SCUBA Gear]] from the\
      \ bottom of the pool. Collect any further ASMD Cores you require from behind\
      \ the pillars, then return down the corridor to the waterway.\n\nFrom the loose\
      \ stones,take a left and duck into the inner corner as the waterway goes round.\
      \ You will see a concealed entrance in the floor (pictured). Take a dip - the\
      \ SCUBA Gear will activate automatically - and follow the tunnel. You will find\
      \ a box of 50 Bullets, and further along two Nali Healing Fruit, two ASMD Cores\
      \ and a Kevlar Suit. The tunnel continues in a vertical shaft but it's a dead\
      \ end, so don't waste the SCUBA gear. Return to the hole and surface. Return\
      \ past the obelisk of the clouds to the holy altar, where one previously barred\
      \ opening is now accessible.\n\nExtra: Return to the pyramid room and dive down\
      \ so that you reach the hole in the floor that you didn't go down earlier. Now\
      \ that you have the SCUBA gear, you can do it without risk of drowning.\nThe\
      \ barrel at the very bottom of the vertical shaft is empty, so take a turn part\
      \ of the way down into a horizontal shaft where there is a Devilfish. At the\
      \ crossroads, straight ahead and to the left are dead ends, so turn right, where\
      \ another Devilfish will attack. This is a dead end too but there is a vertical\

      \ you can collect it. Do so. Now... the ceremonial chambers... remember that\

      \ bars open to reveal a gold door that creates a shortcut.\n\nGo through the\
      \ door and follow the wooden platforms round to a Skaarj teleporter. Here a\
      \ Nali will take fright and head through the teleport; take the teleport yourself\
      \ but try not to telefrag him.\nYou will appear right by the entrance to the\
      \ Ceremonial Chambers. Ignore the SkaarjWarrior who charges from behind, and\
      \ leap straight through the now open stone seal to exit the level.\n\n==Translator\
