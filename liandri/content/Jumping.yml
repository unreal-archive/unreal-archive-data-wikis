    text: "'''Jumping''' is a basic movement technique in most, if not all, modern\
      \ shooter games. In the [[Unreal series]] of games, jumping is used exclusively\
      \ for gaining height and does not provide any additional horizontal speed boosts,\
      \ which is what [[dodging]] is used for. There are, however, a few advanced\
      \ movement techniques that involve jumping.\n\nVarious Unreal games provide\
      \ the [[Jump Boots]] power-up to greatly increase the player's jump height.\n\
      \n== Double Jump ==\nA double jump is a jumping move performed in mid-air, which\
      \ was introduced in [[UT2003]]. It can be performed at the apex of the movement\
      \ parabola to increase the total jump height. In UT2003 and [[UT2004]], a double\
      \ jump can be performed once during any kind of air movement, in UT3 only if\
      \ the air movement wasn't started by [[dodging]]. The Quad Jump [[mutator]]\
      \ increases the possible number of mid-air jumps to three during any kind of\
      \ air movement. If you jump right after walking over a ledge you actually perform\
      \ this mid-air jump, which is why you can't actually do a \"double jump\" in\
      \ that case.\n\nThe double jump after a dodging move is called [[Dodging#Dodge\
      \ Jump|Dodge Jump]]. In [[UT3]] the dodge jump is no longer allowed. If the\
      \ player has the [[Jump Boots]], they can be activated with a double jump. Despite\
      \ the restriction of the dodge jump, the [[Jump Boots]] can also be activated\
      \ like this after a dodging move.\n\n== Impact Jump ==\nReleasing the [[Impact\
      \ Hammer]]'s or [[Shield Gun]]'s primary fire towards the ground and jumping\
      \ at the same time will combine the jump movement with the backward momentum\
      \ of the melee weapon, resulting in a much higher jump at the expense of some\
      \ [[health]]. For maximum height, the weapon should be aimed straight down.\
      \ For maximum distance, it should be aimed down about 45 to 60 degrees and you\
      \ should also run backwards. This makes timing the impact jump a little harder,\
      \ though. In [[UT2003]] and [[UT2004]] you can even try \"impact dodge jumping\"\
      \ if you need even more distance.\n\nThe impact jump is UT's replacement for\
      \ other games' rocket jump. Attempting to perform a rocket jump in UT will mostly\
      \ hurt and hardly push you anywhere. The closest thing probably is a \"ripper\
      \ jump\" performed with the secondary firing mode of [[UT]]'s [[Ripper]] or\
      \ a \"shockball jump\" performed with the secondary fire mode of the [[Shock\
      \ Rifle]], though an impact jump outperforms both of them while at the same\
