      <p>The manual states that the Shield Gun alt fire is more capable of shielding\
      \ off energy weapon fire. But to what extent? The energy projectiles can be\

      \ values? And also, this should be mentioned in the article somewhere.\n</p><p>Sure,\
      \ shock beams are reflected. Unlike reflected projectiles, they keep their original\
      \ instigator though, so a player can't kill himself by getting hit by his own\
      \ shock beam reflected by someone else's Shieldgun. Interestingly, although\
      \ the reflection code is very generic in both player and vehicle weapons, no\
      \ weapon or vehicle other than the Shock and InstaGib rifle use it. In theory,\
      \ setting a simply variable through a mutator should be able to turn on reflection\
      \ for almost all hitscan weapons. —<a href=\"/User:Wormbo\" title=\"User:Wormbo\"\
