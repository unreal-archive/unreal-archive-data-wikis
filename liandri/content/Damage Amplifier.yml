  text:
    text: "<p>The <b>Damage Amplifier</b>, (just <b>Amplifier</b>, or <b>UDamage</b>\
      \ due to its shape and name in the code) also occasionally called the <b>Double\
      \ Damage</b> from UT2003 on, is a <a href=\"/Category:Power-ups_and_items\"\
      \ title=\"Category:Power-ups and items\">power-up</a> that temporarily enhances\
      \ the player's weapon damage. It also makes a distinctive sound when picked\
      \ up, and every time the user's <a href=\"/Category:Weapons\" title=\"Category:Weapons\"\
      >weapon</a> fires to alert others that someone is using it. It is much sought\
      \ after in multiplayer games due to its relatively big impact.\n</p><p>The original\
      \ <a href=\"/Unreal\" title=\"Unreal\">Unreal</a> design resembled a car battery,\
      \ but starting with <a href=\"/UT\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UT\">UT</a>\
      \ it became U-shaped, possibly inspired by Unreal's \"U\" logo, and the <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> blades through that. Originally gold in\
      \ UT, purple became the item's telltale color in later games. It is worth noting,\
      \ however, that picking up the Damage Amplifier in UT made the player's weapon\
      \ become purple, as well as make the player themselves glow purple.\n</p><p>The\
      \ Damage Amplifier started out in Unreal as possibly providing up to 4x the\
      \ damage for certain weapons only. In UT, this was expanded to all weapons,\
      \ however, the damage was reduced to only triple. Since UT2003, the damage amplifier\
      \ has only doubled the damage.\n</p>\n<div id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"><div id=\"\

      \ and [[UT2004]]'s Double Damage pickup resembles that of UT, but is purple\
      \ and semi-transparent. It looks somewhat like a hologram. Players carrying\
      \ the Double Damage have a purple glowing weapon and emit purple light.\n\n\
      Note that the HUD timer in UT2004 counts game seconds. The displayed initial\
      \ time of 30 game seconds roughly corresponds to 27 real seconds. This is due\
      \ to game code making the game run at 110% of real-time speed.\n{{clear}}\n\n\

      \nLike other power-ups, the Damage Amp is dropped when the player dies or gets\
      \ hit by the [[Impact Hammer]]'s EMP mode.\n\nPicking up the Damage Amp while\
      \ already carrying [[Berserk]] or [[Invulnerability]] or picking up any of those\
      \ power-ups while already carrying the Damage Amp gives the user a \"Juggernaut\"\
      \ award.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Unreal Championship==\n[[UC]]'s Damage Amplifier is\
      \ similar to that of UT2003.\n{{sectstub}}\n\n==Unreal Championship 2==\nIn\
      \ [[UC2]] the amplifier is referred to as \"UDamage\" (Unreal Damage). It is\
      \ purple, but has a somewhat more technical look with metal bits. If a player\
      \ picks it up, it spawns a slowly growing, transparant, purple animation of\
      \ that player looking like (s)he is roaring, clearly indicating the item was\
      \ picked to other players. This can be seen roughly two thirds into [http://www.gametrailers.com/player/2947.html\
