      \ that worked on a mod called 'Gunman Chronicles'. After having switched games\
      \ a few times (first from Quake I to Quake II, and finally to Half-Life), the\
      \ mod got noticed by Half-Life's developers: Valve software. The mod ended up\
      \ becoming a retail game, which paved the way for the creation of their own\
      \ studio. The former mod crew (including people from as far as South Africa,\
      \ Germany and the USA) chose Amsterdam, The Netherlands as their base of operations.\
      \ \n</p><p>The company's main focus lies in outsourcing. They were contracted\
      \ for several big games, such as Ghost Recon 2, Saint's Row and Battlefield\
      \ 2142. They were also contracted by <a href=\"/Epic_Games\" title=\"Epic Games\"\
      >Epic Games</a> on three occasions. Streamline was assigned to make the intro\
      \ for the UT2004 single-player campaign, as well as a showcase level for the\
      \ new vehicles (which ended up being <a href=\"/ONS-Torlan\" title=\"ONS-Torlan\"\
      >ONS-Torlan</a>). They continued to support this game, with the release of <a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mapraider.com/maps/?fileid=2123\"\
      >AS-Confexia</a>. For Gears of War the company was asked to model \"The Stranded\"\
      , plus a set of destroyable furniture. In their 3rd venture with Epic, they\
      \ made a series of assets for the Asian and human worlds in Unreal Tournament\
      \ 3. <br /> After many outsourcing projects and winning several awards for their\
      \ work, the company started to develop its own IP's, one of them being HoopWorld:\
      \ A basketball game for Xbox Live Arcade.\n</p><p>Early 2008, Streamline Studios\
      \ confirmed the formation of Streamline Sound (a joint venture with the recording\
      \ company Black Hole Recordings). This company combines the audio services,\
      \ 5.1 studio and artist catalog of Black Hole Recordings (including electronic\
      \ music-producer Tiësto), and offers audio services, music licensing, and an\
      \ \"innovative music publishing model\". Streamline Sound will release the soundtrack\
      \ of Korean MMORPG Granado Espada in the first half of 2008.\n</p>\n<h2><span\
