      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>So, you have escaped from <a href=\"/Glathriel_Village_(part_2)\" title=\"\
      Glathriel Village (part 2)\">Glathriel Village</a> in one piece. Now, you know\
      \ that the object of your search is near. Pursuing your quest, you emerge in\
      \ a small tract of land.\n</p><p>You start in the cave via which you left Glathriel\
      \ Village. In a tunnel entrance ahead, a <a href=\"/Gasbag\" title=\"Gasbag\"\
      >Gasbag</a> sights you and attacks. Kill it. When it is dead, go towards the\
      \ tunnel entrance and enter the tunnel, making a diversion to collect the <a\
      \ href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a>\
      \ on the right if you need to. Follow the tunnel's curvature round to the left.\
      \ You will shortly emerge in a small tract of land. You are on a dirt path with\
      \ a section of ground raised on your left.\n</p><p>Follow the dirt path. It\
      \ slopes up to meet the level of the raised grassy area. The raised grassy area\
      \ has a fence and a few plants but nothing of great interest. Watch out as you\
      \ near the raised level, because you can expect to be spotted by some of a group\
      \ of four <a href=\"/Predator\" title=\"Predator\">Predators</a> that patrol\
      \ this level. Kill them as you proceed through the area - I recommend the <a\
      \ href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle\">CAR</a>.\n</p><p>Beyond the raised grassy area, the valley continues\
      \ past a large rock on the left. Follow it through - there's a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit beyond the rock if you need it - and you will come out shortly in the\
      \ middle of a cluster of three Nali huts. If you're in the mood for looking\
      \ around, you can go round to the right of the rightermost hut. Passing a Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit, a barrier will open and you will be in a <a href=\"/Nali_Cow\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nali Cow\">Nali Cow</a> pen. There's nothing\
      \ of interest in there though.\n</p><p>Visit the huts one by one. I'll start\
      \ with the one on the right. This hut contains a <a href=\"/Nali\" title=\"\
      Nali\">Nali</a> praying by his fire. Raid barrels for two clusters of 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards, then read the Nali's diary on the table [1].\n</p><p>Leave and cross\
      \ the settlement to the hut opposite. Barrels outside reveal a <a href=\"/Seed\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seed\">Nali Fruit Seed</a>. Going in, you will\
      \ find a Nali and a barrel containing a <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flare</a>.\
      \ Go then to the third and final house, the one at the end. You will find another\
      \ Nali, two <a href=\"/Bandages\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bandages\">Bandages</a>\
      \ on the table and wooden crates that reveal a Clip. When you're done, leave\
      \ the house and go to the right where there is a UMS drop box generously supplied\
      \ with two 50 bullet CAR Clips and a Combat Assault Rifle.\n</p><p>Whilst in\
      \ this area, take a moment to go towards a gap in the cliffs where there is\
      \ a fence with a break in it. You will realise then that you are looking out\
      \ over a huge valley that contains your goal - the hulk of the UMS Prometheus.\n\
      </p><p>It's a long way down into the valley, so don't jump off the cliff or\
      \ you'll be smashed on the ground below. You'll see a UMS drop box on the floor\
      \ of the valley but you can't get to it. Instead, return to the houses and make\
      \ a left. You'll come to another fence with a gap in it, where you can collect\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit on the right if you need it.\n</p><p>Go through the gap\
      \ in the fence and follow the valley on downwards. Shortly it ends in another\
      \ tunnel entrance. Go into the tunnel and follow it down to the large cave beyond.\
      \ Within the cave, you will see a ravine blocking your path with a precarious\
      \ wooden bridge crossing it to the left. As you enter, two <a href=\"/Gasbag\"\
      \ title=\"Gasbag\">Gasbags</a> will descend from the roof of the cave, causing\
      \ a Nali on the far side of the bridge to run across it in a panic. The bridge\
      \ collapses under the Nali's weight.\n</p><p>First things first, kill the Gasbags.\
      \ Then, raid wooden crates on the left on this side of the ravine for two clusters\
      \ of 40 Tarydium Shards. Now comes the tricky part - you may want to save your\
      \ game first. Go on to the raised section of earth that the bridge crossed from.\
      \ Take a good run up and try to jump across the ravine - if you fall short then\
      \ you'll be squashed on the floor of the ravine.\n</p><p>Once safely on the\
      \ other side, take a look at the first tunnel entrance on the left and you will\
      \ see that it is blocked by a large boulder. Open a barrel here for a <a href=\"\
      /Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a>. Then, go to the right and down a short\
      \ drop on to a lower level. There's another tunnel entrance there, but first\
      \ destroy wooden crates beyond for a Nali Fruit Seed. Take the tunnel entrance\
      \ and follow it through until you come out in a mine cave. Watch out as you\
      \ enter for four <a href=\"/Spinner\" title=\"Spinner\">Spinners</a> that attack\
      \ from various corners.\n</p><p>Look around. To the left is a high-tech outcrop\
      \ of Skaarj mine architecture. Ahead is an old Nali mine working.\n</p><p>Go\
      \ down the old Nali mine working first. It comes to a dead end at a rock fall,\
      \ but you can open barrels there for 40 Tarydium Shards and a Nali Fruit Seed.\
      \ Return to the main mine cave.\n</p><p>Approach the high-tech entrance now\
      \ (to the right as you return to the cave). There, you will see a <a href=\"\
      /Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a> on\
      \ some large boxes. To get to it, locate a small metal crate and push it to\
      \ the boxes, then use it as a step. When you've got the belt, go into the high-tech\
      \ entrance and ride the lift within up to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\n\
      So, you have escaped from [[Glathriel Village (part 2)|Glathriel Village]] in\
      \ one piece. Now, you know that the object of your search is near. Pursuing\
      \ your quest, you emerge in a small tract of land.\n\nYou start in the cave\
      \ via which you left Glathriel Village. In a tunnel entrance ahead, a [[Gasbag]]\
      \ sights you and attacks. Kill it. When it is dead, go towards the tunnel entrance\
      \ and enter the tunnel, making a diversion to collect the [[Nali Healing Fruit]]\
      \ on the right if you need to. Follow the tunnel's curvature round to the left.\
      \ You will shortly emerge in a small tract of land. You are on a dirt path with\
      \ a section of ground raised on your left.\n\nFollow the dirt path. It slopes\
      \ up to meet the level of the raised grassy area. The raised grassy area has\
      \ a fence and a few plants but nothing of great interest. Watch out as you near\
      \ the raised level, because you can expect to be spotted by some of a group\
      \ of four [[Predator|Predators]] that patrol this level. Kill them as you proceed\
      \ through the area - I recommend the [[Combat Assault Rifle|CAR]].\n\nBeyond\
      \ the raised grassy area, the valley continues past a large rock on the left.\
      \ Follow it through - there's a Nali Healing Fruit beyond the rock if you need\
      \ it - and you will come out shortly in the middle of a cluster of three Nali\
      \ huts. If you're in the mood for looking around, you can go round to the right\
      \ of the rightermost hut. Passing a Nali Healing Fruit, a barrier will open\
      \ and you will be in a [[Nali Cow]] pen. There's nothing of interest in there\
      \ though.\n\nVisit the huts one by one. I'll start with the one on the right.\
      \ This hut contains a [[Nali]] praying by his fire. Raid barrels for two clusters\
      \ of 40 Tarydium Shards, then read the Nali's diary on the table [1].\n\nLeave\
      \ and cross the settlement to the hut opposite. Barrels outside reveal a [[Seed|Nali\
      \ Fruit Seed]]. Going in, you will find a Nali and a barrel containing a [[Flare]].\
      \ Go then to the third and final house, the one at the end. You will find another\
      \ Nali, two [[Bandages]] on the table and wooden crates that reveal a Clip.\
      \ When you're done, leave the house and go to the right where there is a UMS\
      \ drop box generously supplied with two 50 bullet CAR Clips and a Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle.\n\nWhilst in this area, take a moment to go towards a gap in the cliffs\
      \ where there is a fence with a break in it. You will realise then that you\
      \ are looking out over a huge valley that contains your goal - the hulk of the\
      \ UMS Prometheus.\n\nIt's a long way down into the valley, so don't jump off\
      \ the cliff or you'll be smashed on the ground below. You'll see a UMS drop\
      \ box on the floor of the valley but you can't get to it. Instead, return to\
      \ the houses and make a left. You'll come to another fence with a gap in it,\
      \ where you can collect a Nali Healing Fruit on the right if you need it.\n\n\
      Go through the gap in the fence and follow the valley on downwards. Shortly\
      \ it ends in another tunnel entrance. Go into the tunnel and follow it down\
      \ to the large cave beyond. Within the cave, you will see a ravine blocking\
      \ your path with a precarious wooden bridge crossing it to the left. As you\
      \ enter, two [[Gasbag|Gasbags]] will descend from the roof of the cave, causing\
      \ a Nali on the far side of the bridge to run across it in a panic. The bridge\
      \ collapses under the Nali's weight.\n\nFirst things first, kill the Gasbags.\
      \ Then, raid wooden crates on the left on this side of the ravine for two clusters\
      \ of 40 Tarydium Shards. Now comes the tricky part - you may want to save your\
      \ game first. Go on to the raised section of earth that the bridge crossed from.\
      \ Take a good run up and try to jump across the ravine - if you fall short then\
      \ you'll be squashed on the floor of the ravine.\n\nOnce safely on the other\
      \ side, take a look at the first tunnel entrance on the left and you will see\
      \ that it is blocked by a large boulder. Open a barrel here for a [[Stinger]].\
      \ Then, go to the right and down a short drop on to a lower level. There's another\
      \ tunnel entrance there, but first destroy wooden crates beyond for a Nali Fruit\
      \ Seed. Take the tunnel entrance and follow it through until you come out in\
      \ a mine cave. Watch out as you enter for four [[Spinner|Spinners]] that attack\
      \ from various corners.\n\nLook around. To the left is a high-tech outcrop of\
      \ Skaarj mine architecture. Ahead is an old Nali mine working.\n\nGo down the\
      \ old Nali mine working first. It comes to a dead end at a rock fall, but you\
      \ can open barrels there for 40 Tarydium Shards and a Nali Fruit Seed. Return\
      \ to the main mine cave.\n\nApproach the high-tech entrance now (to the right\
      \ as you return to the cave). There, you will see a [[Shield Belt]] on some\
      \ large boxes. To get to it, locate a small metal crate and push it to the boxes,\
      \ then use it as a step. When you've got the belt, go into the high-tech entrance\
      \ and ride the lift within up to exit the level.\n\n== Translator messages ==\n\
