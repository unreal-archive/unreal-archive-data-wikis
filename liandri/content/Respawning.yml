      \ respawning works basically the same as it does in UT. A new feature is that\

      \ points are indicated with a weapon base. This makes it easier for player,\
      \ especially ones new to the map, to find weapons, even if they aren't currently\
      \ available. Ammo and other items don't have bases. Epic invented a new kind\

      >Weapon Locker</a> for the <a href=\"/Onslaught\" title=\"Onslaught\">Onslaught</a>\
      \ and <a href=\"/Assault\" title=\"Assault\">Assault</a> gametypes. Weapon Lockers\
      \ hold multiple weapons in a small space, but respawn those weapons for individual\
      \ players. In other words, if a player uses a Weapon Locker, he won't be able\
      \ to use it for a while, but other players can still use it, starting their\
      \ own respawn timer for that Weapon Locker.\n</p><p><a href=\"/UC2\" class=\"\

      \ It is revealed in the final match of the <a href=\"/Ascension_Rites\" title=\"\

      \ have a non-renewable energy source that are used only when Respawners are\
