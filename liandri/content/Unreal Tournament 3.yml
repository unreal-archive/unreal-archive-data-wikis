      <p>UT3 was revealed to the world in the May 2005 issue of Computer Gaming World\
      \ magazine. The first news of it began to appear on or around March 27, 2005.\
      \ The game was originally codenamed UT \"Envy\", but later, around May 29, 2005,\
      \ it was revealed that the name had been changed to <b>Unreal Tournament 2007</b>.\
      \ It was not until January 25, 2007 at the Midway Gamer's Day event in Las Vegas\
      \ that it was revealed that the game's name had been changed to <b>Unreal Tournament\
      \ 3</b>. This change was met with great enthusiasm from the Unreal fan base.\n\
      </p><p>Early in the development of the game, many features were discussed that\
      \ were later dropped. A game mode named <b>Conquest</b> was originally announced\
      \ as a war spanning multiple levels with lots of dynamic things like <a href=\"\
      /Nanoblack\" title=\"Nanoblack\">nanoblack</a> taking over parts of levels owned\
      \ by the <a href=\"/Necris\" title=\"Necris\">Necris</a>. An updated version\
      \ of Onslaught entitled <b>Onslaught 2.0</b> was also discussed early in the\
      \ game's development cycle.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"\
      #cite_note-2\">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>. LAter both of these game modes were collapsed\
      \ into Warfare.\n</p><p>Unreal Tournament 3 promised a return to the \"feel\"\
      \ of the original Unreal Tournament. Epic's aim was to make the game more in-your-face,\
      \ fast-paced, and less \"floaty\". To accomplish this, gravity was increased\
      \ and dodge jump was removed. However, dodging, double jumps, and wall dodging\
      \ remained. Gameplay in UT3 stresses close combat and projectile weapons more\
      \ than any of its predecessors.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\
      Beta_Demo\">Beta Demo</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Unreal_Tournament_3?section=2\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Beta Demo\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>At Midnight on Friday, October 12th, 2007, Fileplanet began preloading the\
      \ game to its subscribers. The demo was unlocked and released on FilePlanet\
      \ at 12:35 PM on Friday, October 12th. The release was apparently several hours\
      \ earlier than intended, probably in response to a Norwegian site, \"IT Avisen\"\
      , leaking the demo approximately 5 hours earlier than FilePlanet.\n</p><p>The\
      \ demo, which was Version 3464, came with 3 maps: <a href=\"/DM-ShangriLa\"\
      \ title=\"DM-ShangriLa\">DM-ShangriLa</a>, <a href=\"/DM-HeatRay\" title=\"\
      DM-HeatRay\">DM-HeatRay</a>, and <a href=\"/VCTF-Suspense\" title=\"VCTF-Suspense\"\
      >VCTF-Suspense</a>. Of note is that DM-HeatRay was the first taste of the <a\
      \ href=\"/Necris#Technology\" title=\"Necris\">Necris vehicles</a>, specifically,\
      \ the <a href=\"/Darkwalker\" title=\"Darkwalker\">Darkwalker</a>.\n</p><p>Epic\
      \ called the release an \"Open Beta Demo\" in an attempt to signify the incomplete\
      \ status of the demo. Epic promised to respond to user feedback in order to\
      \ fix issues in the final game. Several issues reported during the beta demo\
      \ period were fixed or began to be fixed in the first patch. An updated demo\
      \ fixing these issues was never released.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>On November 12th, 2007 (a full seven days prior to\
      \ the NA release), the German version of the game was released to German retailers.\
      \ In order to comply with German regulations for public game sales, the game\
      \ had blood, gibs, and headshots removed from the game. Very little else was\
      \ changed except for the localization to German.\n</p><p>The US retail release\
      \ came on November 19th, 2007. This, however, was the \"ship\" date, and thus\
      \ many stores did not receive physical product until November 20th, 2007. The\
      \ Canadian release came on November 20, and stores put it on shelves the very\
      \ next day. The European release came on November 23, 2007.\n</p>\n<h3><span\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Reception\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Reception to the beta demo was generally positive,\
      \ with most people agreeing that Epic has \"got it right.\" There was some notable\
      \ dissension from the crowd who enjoyed UT2003 and UT2004 though, particularly\
      \ about the removal of dodge jump. Unreal Tournament players, which Epic were\
      \ targeting, didn't switch to UT3 either due to steep system requirements and\
      \ the overall unstable state of the game for months after release.\n</p><p>Reception\
      \ to the game on PC was been mostly favorable from the community and warm from\
      \ reviewers, with a score of 83 on Metacritic<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"\
      reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>. Warfare, in particular,\
      \ has been praised for being a more strategic and improved version of <a href=\"\
      /Onslaught\" title=\"Onslaught\">Onslaught</a>, though the gametype turned off\
      \ many veteran Onslaught players due to additions like the Orb.\n</p><p>Several\
      \ issues with the game led to low player numbers, with the key issues being:\n\
      </p>\n<ul><li> Lackluster Single-Player and no Tournament mode\n<dl><dd> While\
      \ the Single-Player was hyped a lot, it failed to deliver. It was too long and\
      \ it completely replaced the old Tournament mode. It also had awkward explanations\
      \ for classic arena gametypes, like <b><a href=\"/FLaG\" title=\"FLaG\">FLaGs</a></b>\
      \ (<b>F</b>ield <b>La</b>ttice <b>G</b>enerators) and that scoring points ran\
      \ out enemy <a href=\"/Respawner\" title=\"Respawner\">respawners</a>. </dd></dl></li>\n\
      <li> Awkward and simple UI\n<dl><dd> The UI felt very awkward and was very simple\
      \ compared to previous UT games. There were very little options available for\
      \ common settings, and overall the UI felt very unfinished. Many settings could\
      \ be changed via INI, however often these settings do not save, revert, or appear\
      \ to have no effect. As of Patch 2.0, the UI has been reworked with a new color\
      \ scheme and more advanced options, fixing many of the prior complaints. As\
      \ of June 2014, Gamespy has been removed from UT3 which fixed many of the issues\
      \ with config files reverting.</dd></dl></li>\n<li> Astoundingly bad Server\
      \ Admin launch\n<dl><dd> Perhaps the worst problem, due to UT3 being primarily\
      \ a multiplayer game, are issues with the server admin tools. The initial release\
      \ of the Windows dedicated server package was littered with bugs preventing\
      \ a significant number of hosts from running servers. The Linux dedicated server\
      \ was released a month after the retail game, on December 18, 2007 which left\
      \ many hosts without any UT3 package to offer. Web Admin was also missing from\
      \ both the original release and the first patch, though it was released alongside\
      \ Patch 2 and received steady updates until support ended for the game in 2009.</dd></dl></li>\n\
      <li> Modding support simplified\n<dl><dd> Another key complaint with the game\
      \ is that much of what used to be done in UnrealScript has been moved to native\

      </p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/Viper\" title=\"Viper\">Viper</a>\n<dl><dd> A single\
      \ passenger speeder. The primary gun fires projectiles that bounce off walls,\
      \ similar to <a href=\"/Ripper\" title=\"Ripper\">Ripper</a> projectiles in\
      \ the original <a href=\"/UT\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UT\">UT</a>. The\
      \ vehicle can also spread out like a real life viper to hover high in the sky.\
      \ Like the Scorpion, it can be used on kamikaze missions, and ram vehicles or\
      \ targets from the air.</dd></dl></li>\n<li><a href=\"/Darkwalker\" title=\"\
      Darkwalker\">Darkwalker</a>\n<dl><dd> This lumbering tripod has tendril-like\
      \ legs that allow them to climb a wider variety of terrain compared to other\
      \ vehicles. The primary weapon is an extremely powerful twin laser beam that\
      \ shoots out a line of plasma. The secondary fire \"screams\" knocking players\
      \ off their feet and out of some vehicles (Manta, Viper) or force others out\
      \ of the way (Scavenger). The vehicle also features a secondary gunner position\
      \ that functions similar to a Plasma Turret.</dd></dl></li>\n<li><a href=\"\
      /Nemesis\" title=\"Nemesis\">Nemesis</a>\n<dl><dd> The Nemesis is the Necris\
      \ answer to the Goliath, and it features an instant hit twin laser beam with\
      \ zoom. The vehicle also supports different modes. When you crouch down the\
      \ vehicle moves faster, but it will completely lock your aim forward, with no\
      \ motion at all except for vehicular manipulation. You can also rise up to attack,\
      \ but this makes you more of a target. You can also rise up even more to increase\
      \ the beams' rate of fire... but this makes you nearly immobile, roughly on\
      \ par with the Leviathan, as well as a very large and obvious target.</dd></dl></li>\n\
      <li><a href=\"/Fury\" title=\"Fury\">Fury</a>\n<dl><dd> The Fury is a single-seated\
      \ flying vehicle that specializes in shooting down other air units. This vehicle\
      \ can dodge, allowing you to barrel roll out of the way. Primary fire is a hitscan\
      \ beam attack, similar in nature to the Darkwalker but with less range, and\
      \ with a lock-on ability once struck as well as a very quick recharge time.\
      \ Altfire allows a quick burst of speed to get out of the way of missiles or\
      \ shots heading your way. It was planned to hold 2 passengers, who could control\
      \ small guns like the Dark Walker passenger gun, this was cancelled due to the\
      \ size.</dd></dl></li>\n<li><a href=\"/Nightshade\" title=\"Nightshade\">Nightshade</a>\n\
      <dl><dd> Seemingly the Necris answer to the Axon's Hellbender, this stealth-based\
      \ vehicle primarily has  <a href=\"/Deployables#Unreal_Tournament_3\" title=\"\
      Deployables\">deployables</a> as weapons: <a href=\"/Deployables#Spidermine_Trap\"\
      \ title=\"Deployables\">Spider Mines</a>, <a href=\"/Deployables#EMP\" title=\"\
      Deployables\">EMP Mines</a>, <a href=\"/Deployables#Shield_Generator\" title=\"\
      Deployables\">Shield Generators</a>, and the <a href=\"/Deployables#Stasis_Field\"\
      \ title=\"Deployables\">Stasis Field</a>, commonly called the \"Slow Volume.\"\
      \ Its only other weapon is a short-range beam similar to the Link Gun's, with\
      \ very limited range that heals vehicles and nodes at a greatly accelerated\
      \ speed. It can uncloak to go faster, toggled with Altfire.</dd></dl></li>\n\
      <li><a href=\"/Scavenger\" title=\"Scavenger\">Scavenger</a>\n<dl><dd> This\
      \ spherical vehicle can extend its legs and pull itself up terrain or retract\
      \ them and roll on the ground like a ball. It also has a spinning attack that\
      \ is effective against infantry. A small ball hovers around the vehicle; it\
      \ is this orb that attacks directly and not the Scavenger, which acts more like\
      \ a targeting device for this orb to attack. It can move at great speeds while\
      \ rolling on the ground, but has little control as a result. Ramming into other\
      \ vehicles at great speed while rolling as a ball damages them considerably.</dd></dl></li></ul>\n\

      \ and is present only in Warfare and Vehicle Capture the Flag maps. The flag\
      \ or orb may be carried on the Hoverboard, but any amount of damage, even one\
      \ point, will send the player tumbling (this includes falling damage) in addition\
      \ to dropping the orb or flag, if they carried it, unless the player is currently\
      \ wearing a Shieldbelt. A player who falls off will be prone for a moment before\
      \ being able to get up, which could naturally be fatal if there's opposition\

      <dl><dd> These formerly stationary one-man laser cannons are now equipped with\

      \ into the Unreal community, with strong community integration out of the box.\
      \ In-game lobbies were planned for Warfare, and game stats integration would\
      \ have allowed you to find similarly-skilled opponents via the UT3 server browser.\
      \ However, none of these elements shipped with the final game.\n</p><p>A global\
      \ rankings system does exist to allow clans and other players to compare scores.\n\
      </p><p>PS3 users can download specially cooked versions of various maps and\
      \ mutators, provided the author supplies them. However, there are some limitations,\
      \ and custom sounds or music cannot be supported in PS3 versions of the maps\
      \ due to a proprietary sound codec being used.\n</p><p>The XBox 360 version\
      \ does not support custom content. However, the Xbox 360 version of the game\
      \ shipped with exclusive maps and characters not found on the PC or PS3 versions,\
      \ as well as a split-screen mode. These features were added to the PC and PS3\
      \ platform with patch 2.0 and the Titan Pack, though split screen support on\
      \ PC is limited.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"AI_.26_Voice\"\

      \ in the artificial intelligence that controls UT bots, as well as the way in\
      \ which players communicate with them. UT3 players will be able to give bots\
      \ specific orders using their own voices. Whereas in UT or UT2004 you'd use\
      \ the voice menu to tell your bots to \"attack\", you can now give orders like\
      \ \"There's a sniper on the tower, go get him\". Bots will also respond to particular\
      \ questions. For example, if you asked \"Is there anyone in the cave?\", they\
      \ might reply \"No, the cave is clear\".\n</p><p>Apparently, this feature is\
      \ quite buggy however. It is reported to work best for users who have a clear\
      \ North American accent.\n</p><p>UT3 bots' personalities will also make them\
      \ better suited to different in-game tasks.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

    text: "''Note: If you are seeking for the links to essential files, see the [[#Essential\
      \ Files|Essential files section]].''\n\n'''Unreal Tournament 3''', also known\
      \ as '''UT3''' (previously codenamed '''Envy''' and also formerly named '''Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2007''', '''UT2007''', or '''UT2k7''') is [[Epic Games]]' sequel\
      \ to [[Unreal Tournament 2004]]. Published by [[Midway Games]], UT3 is powered\
      \ by Epic's new [[Unreal Engine 3]]. The game was released in late November\
      \ 2007 for the PC, December 2007 (NA) and February 2008 (EU) for PS3, and July\
      \ 2008 for XBox 360. Linux and OSX versions of the game were planned but never\
      \ released, with no official explanation given for the cancellations. The two\
      \ versions of the game were apparently far along with Ryan Gordon even posting\
      \ screenshots of the game running on the two platforms<ref>http://icculus.org/cgi-bin/finger/finger.pl?user=icculus&date=2008-09-18&time=06-38-30</ref>.\n\
      \nUnreal Tournament 3 is the fourth game in the Unreal Tournament series and\
      \ the eighth game in the overall Unreal series. The game is numbered by generation,\
      \ with [[Unreal Tournament]] representing the first generation, [[Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003]] and [[Unreal Tournament 2004]] representing the second generation,\
      \ and UT3 representing the third generation.\n\nOn May 8th, 2014 it was announced\
      \ that a new Unreal Tournament game would be developed alongside the community.\
      \ The game is titled simply '''Unreal Tournament''' but is referred to as [[Unreal\

      \ in the May 2005 issue of Computer Gaming World magazine. The first news of\
      \ it began to appear on or around March 27, 2005. The game was originally codenamed\
      \ UT \"Envy\", but later, around May 29, 2005, it was revealed that the name\
      \ had been changed to '''Unreal Tournament 2007'''. It was not until January\
      \ 25, 2007 at the Midway Gamer's Day event in Las Vegas that it was revealed\
      \ that the game's name had been changed to '''Unreal Tournament 3'''. This change\
      \ was met with great enthusiasm from the Unreal fan base.\n\nEarly in the development\
      \ of the game, many features were discussed that were later dropped. A game\
      \ mode named '''Conquest''' was originally announced as a war spanning multiple\
      \ levels with lots of dynamic things like [[nanoblack]] taking over parts of\
      \ levels owned by the [[Necris]]. An updated version of Onslaught entitled '''Onslaught\
      \ 2.0''' was also discussed early in the game's development cycle.<ref>http://www.beyondunreal.com/articles/beyondunreal-at-e3-steve-polge-on-ut2007/</ref>.\
      \ LAter both of these game modes were collapsed into Warfare.\n\nUnreal Tournament\
      \ 3 promised a return to the \"feel\" of the original Unreal Tournament. Epic's\
      \ aim was to make the game more in-your-face, fast-paced, and less \"floaty\"\
      . To accomplish this, gravity was increased and dodge jump was removed. However,\
      \ dodging, double jumps, and wall dodging remained. Gameplay in UT3 stresses\
      \ close combat and projectile weapons more than any of its predecessors.\n\n\
      ===Beta Demo===\nAt Midnight on Friday, October 12th, 2007, Fileplanet began\
      \ preloading the game to its subscribers. The demo was unlocked and released\
      \ on FilePlanet at 12:35 PM on Friday, October 12th. The release was apparently\
      \ several hours earlier than intended, probably in response to a Norwegian site,\
      \ \"IT Avisen\", leaking the demo approximately 5 hours earlier than FilePlanet.\n\
      \nThe demo, which was Version 3464, came with 3 maps: [[DM-ShangriLa]], [[DM-HeatRay]],\
      \ and [[VCTF-Suspense]]. Of note is that DM-HeatRay was the first taste of the\
      \ [[Necris#Technology|Necris vehicles]], specifically, the [[Darkwalker]].\n\
      \nEpic called the release an \"Open Beta Demo\" in an attempt to signify the\
      \ incomplete status of the demo. Epic promised to respond to user feedback in\
      \ order to fix issues in the final game. Several issues reported during the\
      \ beta demo period were fixed or began to be fixed in the first patch. An updated\
      \ demo fixing these issues was never released.\n\n===Release Details===\nOn\
      \ November 12th, 2007 (a full seven days prior to the NA release), the German\
      \ version of the game was released to German retailers. In order to comply with\
      \ German regulations for public game sales, the game had blood, gibs, and headshots\
      \ removed from the game. Very little else was changed except for the localization\
      \ to German.\n\nThe US retail release came on November 19th, 2007. This, however,\
      \ was the \"ship\" date, and thus many stores did not receive physical product\
      \ until November 20th, 2007. The Canadian release came on November 20, and stores\
      \ put it on shelves the very next day. The European release came on November\
      \ 23, 2007.\n\n===Reception===\nReception to the beta demo was generally positive,\
      \ with most people agreeing that Epic has \"got it right.\" There was some notable\
      \ dissension from the crowd who enjoyed UT2003 and UT2004 though, particularly\
      \ about the removal of dodge jump. Unreal Tournament players, which Epic were\
      \ targeting, didn't switch to UT3 either due to steep system requirements and\
      \ the overall unstable state of the game for months after release.\n\nReception\
      \ to the game on PC was been mostly favorable from the community and warm from\
      \ reviewers, with a score of 83 on Metacritic<ref>http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/unreal-tournament-iii</ref>.\
      \ Warfare, in particular, has been praised for being a more strategic and improved\
      \ version of [[Onslaught]], though the gametype turned off many veteran Onslaught\
      \ players due to additions like the Orb.\n\nSeveral issues with the game led\
      \ to low player numbers, with the key issues being:\n\n* Lackluster Single-Player\
      \ and no Tournament mode\n*: While the Single-Player was hyped a lot, it failed\
      \ to deliver. It was too long and it completely replaced the old Tournament\
      \ mode. It also had awkward explanations for classic arena gametypes, like '''[[FLaG]]s'''\
      \ ('''F'''ield '''La'''ttice '''G'''enerators) and that scoring points ran out\
      \ enemy [[respawner]]s. \n* Awkward and simple UI\n*: The UI felt very awkward\
      \ and was very simple compared to previous UT games. There were very little\
      \ options available for common settings, and overall the UI felt very unfinished.\
      \ Many settings could be changed via INI, however often these settings do not\
      \ save, revert, or appear to have no effect. As of Patch 2.0, the UI has been\
      \ reworked with a new color scheme and more advanced options, fixing many of\
      \ the prior complaints. As of June 2014, Gamespy has been removed from UT3 which\
      \ fixed many of the issues with config files reverting.\n* Astoundingly bad\
      \ Server Admin launch\n*: Perhaps the worst problem, due to UT3 being primarily\
      \ a multiplayer game, are issues with the server admin tools. The initial release\
      \ of the Windows dedicated server package was littered with bugs preventing\
      \ a significant number of hosts from running servers. The Linux dedicated server\
      \ was released a month after the retail game, on December 18, 2007 which left\
      \ many hosts without any UT3 package to offer. Web Admin was also missing from\
      \ both the original release and the first patch, though it was released alongside\
      \ Patch 2 and received steady updates until support ended for the game in 2009.\n\
      * Modding support simplified\n*: Another key complaint with the game is that\
      \ much of what used to be done in UnrealScript has been moved to native code,\
      \ supposedly as a way to improve performance on consoles. This, however, has\
      \ made it increasingly difficult to develop proper mods and mutators for the\
      \ game in many instances. As of Patch 2.0, modding support improved drastically\
      \ however it was never as easy as it had been in previous games.\n\n===Collectors\
      \ Edition===\nOn October 26, 2007, a limited collector's edition of the game\
      \ was announced to be released on PC. This version of the game featured an exclusive\
      \ Collector's Edition tin and a hardcover art book. A bonus DVD is also included\
      \ featuring more than 20 hours of Unreal Engine 3 toolkit video tutorials, the\
      \ history of the Unreal Tournament series, and behind-the-scenes footage of\
      \ the making of the game. The bonus DVD contained a DRM called Anti-WarHawK\
      \ (AWH) which would disable video playback in isolated cases.\n\n===Linux===\n\
      Epic promised to release a Linux installer for the game that would work with\
      \ the standard Windows disc. However, it was later revealed that due to unknown\
      \ \"legal issues\" the Linux installer was not going to be released. The game\
      \ only works with Windows to this day, however it is possible to run the game\
      \ in Linux using Wine<ref>https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=5937</ref>.\n\
      \n===Expansion===\nOn October 20th, 2008, Mark Rein announced via email that\
      \ Midway and Epic were working on a \"major expansion\" for UT3<ref>http://www.beyondunreal.com/view_story.php?id=12277</ref>.\n\
      \nOn January 26th, 2009, the first part of this expansion was revealed in the\
      \ form of a major patch. This information was first revealed publicly [http://www.beyondunreal.com/view_story.php?id=12466\
      \ by BeyondUnreal].\n\nThe second part of this expansion was called the \"Titan\
      \ Pack\". On February 19th, 2009, the contents of the Titan Pack were revealed<ref>http://beyondunreal.com/articles/titan-pack-reveal/</ref>.\
      \ Two new gametypes (Greed and Betrayal), one new Mutator (Titans), 2 new characters\
      \ (Nova and Kana from the 360 version of the game), and 16 new maps, including\
      \ the five exclusive 360 maps. The Titan Pack, along with Patch 2.0, was released\
      \ March 5th, 2009.\n\nCritics of the Titan Pack complained about the number\
      \ of servers running the Titans mutator, which gave players the ability to turn\
      \ into giants with overpowered weapons. Many players found this mutator uninteresting\
      \ and most of the servers running after the pack was released were running the\
      \ mutator.\n\n===Gamespy Removal===\nOn April 3rd, 2014 it was revealed by Glu\
      \ Mobile (current owners of the Gamespy brand) that the Gamespy multiaplyer\
      \ service would be shutting down on July 31st, 2014. This stood to kill the\
      \ master servers for the game. Epic decided to release an update that removes\
      \ Gamespy<ref>http://epicgames.com/community/2014/05/ut3-patch-allows-you-to-play-after-gamespy-shutdown/</ref>\
      \ and replaces it with an in-house solution. This had the side effect of killing\
      \ the stats tracking for the game entirely and disabling the in-game friend\
      \ list, however with the update it is still possible to play the game online\
      \ and continue to host servers for the game.\n\n==Game Content==\n===Engine===\n\
      '''Unreal Tournament 3''' uses [[Unreal Engine 3]]. \n\n====Version History====\n\
      The last and final official version of UT3 is Version 2.1 (3809) also known\
      \ as \"Patch 5\".\n\nOn January 29th, 2009, it was revealed that owners of the\
      \ retail copy of UT3 would be able to use their CD key to register the game\
      \ on Steam<ref>[http://store.steampowered.com/news/2204/ UT3 Black Edition on\
      \ Steam]</ref>. Registering the game on Steam provides access to Steam-only\
      \ features such as the achievements added in version 2.0 of the game.\n\n{|\

      [[Rom Di Prisco]] and [[Jesper Kyd]] composed the UT3 soundtrack. [[Kevin Riepl]]\

      \ as well as a few in-game music tracks.\n\nAn official game soundtrack was\

      \ Single Player|Single Player]]\n*: A five act storyline takes the place of\
      \ the old tournament ladder system from previous games. The campaign contains\
      \ in-engine rendered cutscenes along with the ability to gather \"cards\" that\
      \ can be used to gain certain advantages in maps by completing side objectives.\
      \ Online four player co-op is available for the campaign. \n*[[Deathmatch]]\n\
      *: Free-for-all kill or be killed.  The player with the most frags wins.\n*[[Team\
      \ Deathmatch]]\n*: Two teams duke it out in a quest for battlefield supremacy.\
      \  The team with the most total frags wins.\n*[[Capture the Flag]]\n*: Your\
      \ team must capture the enemy flag by taking it from the enemy base and returning\
      \ it to their own.  If the flag carrier is killed, the flag drops to the ground\
      \ for anyone to pick up.  If your team's flag is taken, it must be returned\
      \ (by touching it after it is dropped) before your team can score a flag capture.\n\
      *[[Vehicle Capture the Flag]]\n*: Traditional Capture The Flag with vehicles\
      \ and Hoverboards instead of Translocators. The Flag may not be carried in any\
      \ vehicle but the Hoverboard.\n*[[Warfare]]\n*: Create a power chain to the\
      \ enemy Core by capturing Nodes in a 'connect the dots' fashion.  Nodes at the\
      \ end of a chain may be controlled by either team.  Control Nodes for your team\
      \ by touching them to start the build process (use the Link Gun alt-fire to\
      \ speed things up).  Once your team has a link to the enemy Core, attack and\
      \ destroy it.\n*[[Duel]]\n*: 1 vs. 1 Dueling Mode.\n*[[Greed]]\n*: Collect Skulls\
      \ by defeating opponents, and return them to the opposing team's base.\n*[[Betrayal]]\n\
      *: Work together to earn bonus points.  Betray your team to keep them.\n\n===Weapons===\n\
      *[[Deployables#Unreal Tournament 3|Deployables]]\n*: Strategy-themed devices.\
      \ These are the Stasis Field, Energy Shield, Spidermine Trap, EMP, Shaped Charge,\
      \ X-Ray Field, and the Link Station. These are dropped by the [[Necris]] [[Nightshade]],\
      \ the [[Axon]] [[Stealthbender]], or are carried by hand.\n*[[Translocator]]\n\
      *: This [[Unreal series]] favorite returns to the [[Capture the Flag]] gametype,\
      \ except for maps that contain vehicles, in which the hoverboard becomes the\
      \ secondary method of transportation. There are more charges than UT2004 (7\
      \ compared to 6) and they refill faster. (About one per second.) Also, the disc\
      \ has a flatter trajectory than UT2004 and it fires farther than UT, but not\
      \ quite as far at UT2004. \n*[[Impact Hammer]]\n*: This favorite from [[Unreal\
      \ Tournament]] makes a comeback with an EMP alt-fire that severely damages vehicles\
      \ and can remove powerups from other players. One of the newer effects of the\
      \ Impact Hammer is that if you get several kills with it, blood and gore smear\
      \ over the hammer - eventually making it more red than orange.\n*[[Enforcer]]\n\
      *: Your starting weapon, the Enforcer is a pistol with rapid fire. Secondary\
      \ fire shoots a less accurate triple burst. You spawn with one enforcer, though\
      \ if a player is killed while holding the weapon it is dropped, and picking\
      \ up a second enforcer allows you to hold two at a time. As a homage to the\
      \ original Enforcer's alternate fire, they now turn sideways when you are close\
      \ to an opponent.\n*[[Bio Rifle]]\n*: This weapon fires a big slow arcing gob\
      \ of sludge that can instantly take out a heavily armed opponent or stick to\
      \ floors and walls, then break apart into smaller pieces creating an instant\
      \ minefield. Players with a large amount of slime attached to them will get\
      \ rapidly \"chipped\" in damage, but they will have a second or two to fight\
      \ back before dying, giving them a chance to take out the enemy who hit them.\n\
      *[[Shock Rifle]]\n*: A classic weapon, the Shock Rifle fires an instant-hit\
      \ beam of energy when primary fire is used, and a floating ball of energy when\
      \ secondary fire is used. Players can also shoot the ball of energy with the\
      \ beam to create a shock combo, dealing intense amounts of damage in a small\
      \ radius (enough to kill a player wearing even medium armor). When compared\
      \ to past titles, the shock balls have been sped up from [[UT2004]] to be more\
      \ closely match the rate of the original [[UT]]. The primary rate of fire has\
      \ also been reduced. Shock combos will now suck up ragdolls in a small vortex,\
      \ and gib them if it does so.\n*[[Link Gun]]\n*: The link gun shoots small fast\
      \ moving plasma balls similar to those in the original [[UT]]. The secondary\
      \ shoots a straight arc of plasma that can skeletize foes, heal vehicles and\
      \ charge power nodes.\n*[[Minigun|Stinger Minigun]]\n*: The stinger from the\
      \ original [[Unreal]] replaces the [[Minigun]] as a fast firing semi-projectile\
      \ weapon. The gun has two modes, a fast but inaccurate spread of [[Tarydium]]\
      \ crystal shards that hits instantly, and a slower firing more powerful projectile\
      \ shot that uses two shards and can also sometimes nail opponents to the wall\
      \ with the killing blow.\n*[[Flak Cannon]]\n*: Primary fire for this weapon\
      \ releases a number of chunks of metal, tearing enemies into shreds. The secondary\
      \ fire releases an undetonated flak shell that detonates and turns to shrapnel\
      \ on impact. Compared to past titles, the primary fire bounces more and has\
      \ a much tighter spread, while the flak shell does not travel as far as it did\
      \ in [[UT2004]], but it has a much higher upward arc.\n*[[Rocket Launcher]]\n\
      *: The new rocket launcher combines the instant rockets ability from [[UT2004]],\
      \ and the grenades from [[UT]]. As in [[UT2004]] primary fire shoots instant\
      \ rockets, secondary fire loads rockets, and hitting primary while holding secondary\
      \ will switch to spiral fire mode with a single tap, grenades with two, or back\
      \ to a spread with three. As in UT2004, rockets can lock onto vehicles. This\
      \ feature has been visibly improved to help take out vehicles, with much better\
      \ locking and turning ability.\n*[[Sniper Rifle]]\n*: The classic sniper rifle\
      \ has returned to replace the [[Lightning Gun]] as the primary long range weapon.\
      \ It now features a orange-colored tracer, and Bolt Action reloading.\n*[[AVRiL|Longbow\
      \ AVRiL]]\n*: The AVRiL is now hand loaded. Its tracking beam can be used to\
      \ \"herd\" [[Deployables#Spidermine_Trap|Spider Mines]], much like the alt-fire\
      \ on the [[Mine Layer]] in [[UT2004]], and the tracking beam is also visible\
      \ to combat problems where a person could get shot with AVRiLs and not know\
      \ where the enemy is. If a friendly teammate fires an AVRiL and they have not\
      \ locked onto a target after a few seconds, it is possible to use your own AVRiL\
      \ to lock onto a target with the targeting beam, which will actually cause the\
      \ missile to come flying back towards its new target!\n*[[Redeemer]]\n*: Acting\
      \ as the sole super weapon in this title, the redeemer fires a small nuclear\
      \ warhead, capable of killing anybody within range regardless of how they are\
      \ protected, and destroying all but the most heavily armored vehicles. It takes\
      \ a few seconds to fully prepare and arm, and it takes up a large portion of\
      \ your visibility as it is doing so. Primary fire just releases the warhead,\
      \ while secondary fire gives you the ability to guide it. If you are close to\
      \ the epicenter, but not directly exposed to damage, you may be knocked off\
      \ your feet for a moment, as if you had fallen off the hoverboard. As always,\
      \ a good shot can take the redeemer down, giving both the firing player and\
      \ the sharpshooter a \"Denied!\" award.\n\n===Pickups===\n====Powerups====\n\
      All Powerups are dropped when the player is killed, or if they are knocked off\
      \ of the player with the Altfire of the Impact Hammer.\n*[[Jump Boots]]\n*:The\
      \ Jump Boots return from UT, and are activated by double jumping. It is possible\
      \ to dodgejump as you could in UT2004, if and only if you have these boots.\n\
      *[[Berserk]]\n*:Increases weapon rate of fire speed. Combined with the Damage\
      \ Amplifier, the game will give you a \"Juggernaut\" award. Additionally, it\
      \ will also supply full ammo for all the weapons you currently have. Weapons\
      \ whose rate of fire is not increased (such as the Stinger's primary fire) will\
      \ act as if they have a damage amplifier, instead.\n*[[Damage Amplifier]]\n\
      *:Gives double damage. Combined with the Berserk, the game will give you a \"\
      Juggernaut\" award.\n*[[Invulnerability]]\n*:Grants you total invincibility\
      \ from all things except for falling off the map or otherwise instant kill zones.\
      \ Watch out for players who use the Impact Hammer's altfire to knock it off\
      \ you!\n*[[Invisibility]]\n*:Makes the player very difficult/impossible to see.\
      \ Note that on Detail Level 1, players literally <i>ARE</i> completely invisible!\n\
      *[[Deployables#Unreal Tournament 3|Slow Field]]\n*:Just like the Stasis Field\
      \ deployable, except this sucker's portable.\n\n====Health====\n*[[Health Vial]]\
      \ - Small and Green. Heals 5 Health, up to a maximum of 199.\n*[[Health Pack]]\
      \ - Large, White Health Packs that somewhat resemble UT2004's Kegs, but a bit\
      \ more rounded and without the blue. Heals 25 Health, up to a maximum of 100.\n\
      *[[Big Keg O' Health]] - As always, the Keg of health provides an instant +100\
      \ Health boost, up to 199 health.\n\n====Armor====\n*[[Shield Belt]]\n*:The\
      \ Shield Belt returns, although it provides only 100 points of protection. However,\
      \ unlike the UT2004 shields, the shield belt will absorb 100% of damage, as\
      \ UT2003 shields do, until it is destroyed. If you are wearing a shield belt\
      \ and in a vehicle when it is destroyed, you will not die instantly - instead,\
      \ you will be ejected from the vehicle like in UT2004 assault maps while in\
      \ Vehicles, but it will cost the Shield Belt. You will also not fall from your\
      \ Hoverboard if you have a Shield belt.\n*[[Armor Vest]]\n*:The Armor Vest provides\
      \ 50 points of protection, and absorbs 75% of taken damage.\n*[[Thigh Pads]]\n\
      *:The Thigh Pads provide 30 points of protection, and absorbs 50% of taken damage.\n\
      *[[Helmet]]\n*:The Helmet provides 20 points of protection, and absorbs 50%\
      \ of taken damage. One feature this piece of armor has that is unique, is its\
      \ ability to block headshots. Assuming you have at least 1 point of Helmet Armor\
      \ on, if your character suffers a headshot, it will not affect him or damage\
      \ him at all - however, the helmet will be destroyed.\n\n===Vehicles===\n====Axon====\n\
      *[[Scorpion]] \n*: The primary fire shoots high steel carbo-fragment balls that\
      \ explode on contact; these are particularly effective against other vehicles,\
      \ but especially against the [[Manta]], [[Viper]], and [[Hoverboard]], upon\
      \ which they home in on. It also now features a speed boost feature. You can\
      \ eject from the Scorpion when using it in this manner, and it will blow up\
      \ and detonate upon impact. If it kills someone due to the explosion, the game\
      \ will reward you with a \"Bullseye!\" award.\n*[[Hellbender]] \n*: The new\
      \ rendition of the hellbender places the driver in control over the skymine\
      \ turret, while the rear turret functions differently from [[UT2004]], being\
      \ more like a standard turret instead of the twin-beam configuration. The rear\
      \ turret can either be rapidly fired for low damage or given a brief moment\
      \ to recharge for more power.\n*[[Manta]] \n*: In addition to a visual update,\
      \ players will no longer be able to ride on top of the side fans. The Manta\
      \ is also unable to hit players without crouching down anymore unless the player\
      \ is on a hoverboard or a slope.\n*[[Raptor]]\n*: Besides the visual update,\
      \ the Raptor now seems to be a bit more responsive to maneuvering, and both\
      \ the rate of fire and locking ability for its missiles have dramatically improved.\n\
      *[[Cicada]]\n*: Sporting a much bulkier and boxier look, the Cicada is mostly\
      \ unchanged, however, ascending and descending seems even faster than before.\
      \ Missiles can still be charged and held with the Altfire.\n*[[Paladin]]\n*:\
      \ Visually much improved from it's UT 2004 debut. The shield will no longer\
      \ remain deployed if it goes through buildings or other level geometry, and\
      \ it will get dimmer with sustained damage to allow visual estimation of how\
      \ charged the shield is. Furthermore, using the shield combo to knock away nearby\
      \ infantry is now instantaneous, as well as depleting the shield slightly, taking\
      \ about six combos before the shield is down. It seems to be slightly faster,\
      \ as well.\n*[[SPMA|Hellfire SPMA]]\n*: The skymine turret is now controlled\
      \ by the driver when the paladin is undeployed. There is no longer a passanger/gunner\
      \ seat. The camera can now crush and kill people if it hits them (or even if\
      \ they simply run into it!) and it also cannot be launched as far upward - however,\
      \ to compensate, the bombing is considerably more tightly packed. There is now\
      \ a visual arc that shows what path the shell will roughly take, assuming that\
      \ the area is strikeable - an area that cannot be bombed will not show this\
      \ targeting arc.\n*[[Goliath]]\n*: The Goliath tank works effectively the same\
      \ to its UT2004 equivalent. It can climb over small obstacles now, such as other\
      \ vehicles, and has a much higher upward firing range than its UT2004 counterpart.\
      \ Its shell range has been decreased somewhat, but they also have less randomness\
      \ in each shot.\n*[[Leviathan]]\n*: This mobile fortress still features its\
      \ devastating main cannon and has added distinct weapon fire to each of its\
      \ four turrets rather than UT2004's link-like projectile. Each turret also has\
      \ an alternate shield function. It has considerably more armor and the Ion Cannon\
      \ takes nearly twice as long to deploy, compared to the UT2004 version. Each\
      \ turret can be individually destroyed as well.\n*[[Stealthbender]]\n*: Axon's\
      \ Stealth Research Division managed to get some of the early specs for the Necris\
      \ Nightshade vehicle and have been attempting to retrofit that technology onto\
      \ their own.\n\n====Necris====\nThe Necris have six vehicles at their disposal:\n\
      *[[Viper]]\n*: A single passenger speeder. The primary gun fires projectiles\
      \ that bounce off walls, similar to [[Ripper]] projectiles in the original [[UT]].\
      \ The vehicle can also spread out like a real life viper to hover high in the\
      \ sky. Like the Scorpion, it can be used on kamikaze missions, and ram vehicles\
      \ or targets from the air.\n*[[Darkwalker]]\n*: This lumbering tripod has tendril-like\
      \ legs that allow them to climb a wider variety of terrain compared to other\
      \ vehicles. The primary weapon is an extremely powerful twin laser beam that\
      \ shoots out a line of plasma. The secondary fire \"screams\" knocking players\
      \ off their feet and out of some vehicles (Manta, Viper) or force others out\
      \ of the way (Scavenger). The vehicle also features a secondary gunner position\
      \ that functions similar to a Plasma Turret.\n*[[Nemesis]]\n*: The Nemesis is\
      \ the Necris answer to the Goliath, and it features an instant hit twin laser\
      \ beam with zoom. The vehicle also supports different modes. When you crouch\
      \ down the vehicle moves faster, but it will completely lock your aim forward,\
      \ with no motion at all except for vehicular manipulation. You can also rise\
      \ up to attack, but this makes you more of a target. You can also rise up even\
      \ more to increase the beams' rate of fire... but this makes you nearly immobile,\
      \ roughly on par with the Leviathan, as well as a very large and obvious target.\n\
      *[[Fury]]\n*: The Fury is a single-seated flying vehicle that specializes in\
      \ shooting down other air units. This vehicle can dodge, allowing you to barrel\
      \ roll out of the way. Primary fire is a hitscan beam attack, similar in nature\
      \ to the Darkwalker but with less range, and with a lock-on ability once struck\
      \ as well as a very quick recharge time. Altfire allows a quick burst of speed\
      \ to get out of the way of missiles or shots heading your way. It was planned\
      \ to hold 2 passengers, who could control small guns like the Dark Walker passenger\
      \ gun, this was cancelled due to the size.\n*[[Nightshade]]\n*: Seemingly the\
      \ Necris answer to the Axon's Hellbender, this stealth-based vehicle primarily\
      \ has  [[Deployables#Unreal Tournament 3|deployables]] as weapons: [[Deployables#Spidermine_Trap|Spider\
      \ Mines]], [[Deployables#EMP|EMP Mines]], [[Deployables#Shield_Generator|Shield\
      \ Generators]], and the [[Deployables#Stasis_Field|Stasis Field]], commonly\
      \ called the \"Slow Volume.\" Its only other weapon is a short-range beam similar\
      \ to the Link Gun's, with very limited range that heals vehicles and nodes at\
      \ a greatly accelerated speed. It can uncloak to go faster, toggled with Altfire.\n\
      *[[Scavenger]]\n*: This spherical vehicle can extend its legs and pull itself\
      \ up terrain or retract them and roll on the ground like a ball. It also has\
      \ a spinning attack that is effective against infantry. A small ball hovers\
      \ around the vehicle; it is this orb that attacks directly and not the Scavenger,\
      \ which acts more like a targeting device for this orb to attack. It can move\
      \ at great speeds while rolling on the ground, but has little control as a result.\
      \ Ramming into other vehicles at great speed while rolling as a ball damages\
      \ them considerably.\n\n====Other====\n*[[Hoverboard]]\n*: Pressing the translocator\
      \ button will cause the player to hop on a hovering skate-board like device\
      \ that is used mainly for transportation and is present only in Warfare and\
      \ Vehicle Capture the Flag maps. The flag or orb may be carried on the Hoverboard,\
      \ but any amount of damage, even one point, will send the player tumbling (this\
      \ includes falling damage) in addition to dropping the orb or flag, if they\
      \ carried it, unless the player is currently wearing a Shieldbelt. A player\
      \ who falls off will be prone for a moment before being able to get up, which\
      \ could naturally be fatal if there's opposition in the area. This also extends\
      \ to grappling onto a vehicle, so if the carrier is shot from high up as they're\
      \ attached to a raptor or other flying vehicle, it is generally lethal unless\
      \ the player has lots of armor and health.\n*[[Turrets#Unreal Tournament 3|Turrets]]\n\
      *: These formerly stationary one-man laser cannons are now equipped with rails,\
      \ offering the turret limited mobility in order to help prevent attackers from\
      \ taking advantage of the terrain by obtaining angles of shot that cannot be\
      \ avoided. These come in four delicious flavors: Energy Turrets, Shock Turrets,\
      \ Rocket Turrets, and Stinger Turrets.\n*[[Eradicator]]\n*: The Eradicator is\
      \ rather like a SPMA, except completely stationary. That doesn't make it any\
      \ less deadly, though, since it can hit you regardless of where you are.\n\n\
      ===Teams===\nTeams present in UT3 are the following:\n*[[Ronin]]\n*: The only\
      \ survivors of the infamous Twin Souls massacre, bound together out of a sense\
      \ of duty, honor, and revenge.\n*[[Iron Guard]]\n*: A group of highly skilled\
      \ and well trained mercenaries, experts in virtually any combat scenario.\n\
      *[[Krall]] \n*: The Necris use these formidable reptilian beasts for the pacification\
      \ of newly conquered planets.\n*[[Necris]] \n*: The secretive Phayder Corporation\
      \ developed the Necris process to produce this elite group of assassins.\n*[[The\
      \ Corrupt|Liandri]] \n*: Combat modified versions of the Liandri Mining Corporation's\
      \ world-class security drones.\n\nThese teams have probably been in the game\
      \ at one point, but appear to have been cut:\n*[[Thunder Crash]] \n*: Even though\
      \ Malcolm is present in the game, he and his team of experienced fighters do\
      \ not participate as opponents in the storyline.\n*[[Juggernauts]] \n*: These\
      \ heavily armored, gene-boosted combatants would have returned from [[UT2004]].\
      \ They mostly consist of disgruntled prisoners and criminals.\n*[[Nakhti]]\n\
      *: The Nakhti possess far advanced technology and are well skilled in fighting.\
      \ They are featured in [[UC2]].\n\n===Characters===\nNew to the Unreal Tournament\
      \ games, UT3 now includes the option to fully customize your character. Players\
      \ are able to switch out several armor pieces: \n* Facemask\n* Helmet\n* Goggles\n\

      Before any official bonus content was released, Epic \"cooked\" a few user created\
      \ maps and mutators for use with the PS3 version to give those users something\
      \ to play with. (All custom content must be created on a PC.)\n\nOn the 20th\
      \ of November 2007, AGEIA released a pack of two UT3 maps (CTF-Lighthouse_PhysX\
      \ and CTF-Tornado_PhysX) to show off advanced PhysX technology. The pack was\
      \ later re-released by NVIDIA and included one more map (DM-HeatRay_PhysX).\n\
      \nOn the 27th of March 2008, Epic released their first bonus pack, which contains\
      \ three maps: [[DM-Morbias]], [[CTF-FacingWorlds]] and [[CTF-Searchlight]].\n\
      \nThe Xbox 360 version of the game has 2 new characters (Kana of the Twin Souls\
      \ and Nova of the Liandri) as well as the Bonus Pack maps and 5 exclusive maps,\
      \ which are: [[WAR-ColdHarbor]], [[DM-KBarge]], [[VCTF-Rails]], [[WAR-Downtown_Necris]]\
      \ and [[VCTF-Suspense_Necris]].\n\nThe Titan Pack is the second bonus pack.\
      \ The pack includes two new game modes, one new mutator, Kana and Nova from\
      \ the XBox 360, two new deployables, a new powerup, a new vehicle, two new weapons,\
      \ and 16 new maps, five of which are the former XBox 360 exclusive maps. It\
      \ also includes the three maps from the first bonus pack. It was released March\
      \ 5th, 2009.\n\n==Essential Files==\nHere you will find all the links to the\

      \ and more people into the Unreal community, with strong community integration\
      \ out of the box. In-game lobbies were planned for Warfare, and game stats integration\
      \ would have allowed you to find similarly-skilled opponents via the UT3 server\
      \ browser. However, none of these elements shipped with the final game.\n\n\
      A global rankings system does exist to allow clans and other players to compare\
      \ scores.\n\nPS3 users can download specially cooked versions of various maps\
      \ and mutators, provided the author supplies them. However, there are some limitations,\
      \ and custom sounds or music cannot be supported in PS3 versions of the maps\
      \ due to a proprietary sound codec being used.\n\nThe XBox 360 version does\
      \ not support custom content. However, the Xbox 360 version of the game shipped\
      \ with exclusive maps and characters not found on the PC or PS3 versions, as\
      \ well as a split-screen mode. These features were added to the PC and PS3 platform\
      \ with patch 2.0 and the Titan Pack, though split screen support on PC is limited.\n\
      \n===AI & Voice===\n{{cleanup|Section|This is still written in future tense.\
      \ If you have any information about the AI & voice now, please rewrite this\
      \ section.}}\nUT3 will bring major advances in the artificial intelligence that\
      \ controls UT bots, as well as the way in which players communicate with them.\
      \ UT3 players will be able to give bots specific orders using their own voices.\
      \ Whereas in UT or UT2004 you'd use the voice menu to tell your bots to \"attack\"\
      , you can now give orders like \"There's a sniper on the tower, go get him\"\
      . Bots will also respond to particular questions. For example, if you asked\
      \ \"Is there anyone in the cave?\", they might reply \"No, the cave is clear\"\
      .\n\nApparently, this feature is quite buggy however. It is reported to work\
      \ best for users who have a clear North American accent.\n\nUT3 bots' personalities\
      \ will also make them better suited to different in-game tasks.\n\n==Previews\
