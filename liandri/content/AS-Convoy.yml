      \ racing along the desert sands of the planet Taron. The attackers begin on\
      \ a vehicle traveling alongside the Hellion repair vessel, where the defenders\
      \ tend to make their stand. The Nexus missiles are located on a trailer on the\
      \ other side of the repair vessel, so the attackers must battle their way from\
      \ vehicle to vehicle to retrieve the missiles.\n</p><p>The map can be considered\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Extend the\
      \ Boarding Platform</dt>\n<dd> This objective requires the attackers to make\
      \ their way along the length of the attack vessel to a timed switch that rotates\
      \ the boarding platform so that they can cross over to the repair vessel. When\
      \ the attacker is moved away from the switch, the platform will swing back to\
      \ its original position, but once the objective is completed, the platform will\
      \ remain extended for the rest of the mission.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>The defending\
      \ team spawns on the upper level of the repair vessel, with access to several\
      \ catwalks overlooking the attack vessel. There is a <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Minigun Turret</a> and several jumppads that propel defenders\
      \ to the attack vessel. There is also a Minigun Turret at the far end of the\
      \ attack vessel, near the weapons cache. The attacking team has a single Minigun\
      \ Turret to the right of the area where they spawn.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt><i>Optional</i>:\
      \ Open the Panel</dt>\n<dd> At the far end of the attack vessel is a timed switch\
      \ that, when activated, will open up a panel and reveal the \"weapons cache\"\
      . This will create a new spawn point for the attackers that is much closer to\
      \ the boarding platform, giving them a strategic advantage in completing the\
      \ first three objectives.</dd>\n<dt>Place Explosives on the Door</dt>\n<dd>\
      \ This objective is another timed switch. Attackers make their way along the\
      \ outer edge of the repair vessel to a doorway, where at least one attacker\
      \ must remain in place for X seconds in order to \"place\" the explosives.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> Once this objective is completed, there will be a brief countdown timer,\
      \ an explosion will blow open a hole in the door (and anyone foolish enough\
      \ to stand too close), and the attackers will have access to the lower level\
      \ of the repair vessel. The defenders will be blocked off from the catwalks\
      \ but now have access to the interior of the repair vessel.</dd>\n<dt>Open Rear\
      \ Door</dt>\n<dd> To open the rear door, attackers need to stand on an objective\
      \ point near the back of the repair vessel for several seconds. This opens the\
      \ back of the repair vessel, where a truck pulls into the vehicle bay and is\
      \ raised on a platform. A bomber plane flies in and bombs the attack vessel,\
      \ killing any players who have not moved on to the repair vessel at this point.\
      \ From the completion of this objective through the end of the match, attackers\
      \ spawn on the lower level of the repair vessel. Defenders also have a new spawn\
      \ point, on the upper level at the very front of the repair vessel. A ramp leads\
      \ downward into the interior of the repair vessel.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Also of\
      \ note, there is also a fuel truck parked in the repair vessel. Attackers can\
      \ use this to jump more easily to the next objective, but the defenders can\
      \ blow it up with only a few well-placed shots.</dd>\n<dt>Open Side Doors</dt>\n\
      <dd> Attackers must activate a switch on a raised platform at the front of the\
      \ repair vessel to open side doors at the front and rear. Standing on this objective\
      \ for no more than a couple seconds will activate the switch completely allowing\
      \ the attackers access to the Nexus Missile Trailer. After this objective is\
      \ completed, the ramp near the defenders' spawn point closes up and for the\
      \ remainder of the match, they maneuver the upper level of the repair vessel\
      \ to catwalks that overlook the Nexus missile trailer.</dd>\n<dt>Infiltrate\
      \ the Nexus Missile Trailer</dt>\n<dd> Attackers must jump across to the Nexus\
      \ Missile Trailer, fight their way to the back and fall down a hatch near the\
      \ back to gain access to the missile bay. Defenders have access to a <a href=\"\
      /Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"Turrets\">Minigun Turret</a> on one\
      \ of the catwalks overlooking the missile trailer, and several jumppads that\
      \ will launch them to the trailer. There is also a Minigun Turret for defenders\
      \ to use on the missile trailer.</dd>\n<dt>Retrieve the Nexus Missiles</dt>\n\
      <dd> At the front of the Nexus Missile Trailer inside the missile bay, attackers\
      \ must stand on the objective for several seconds to get the missiles out of\
      \ the side door. Once this objective is completed, the match is over.</dd></dl>\n\

      <dl><dt> Offensive</dt>\n<dd> On offense, a good strategy in the early portion\
      \ of the map is to get the forward weapons cache as quickly as possible. This\
      \ completely changes the momentum of the game from that point on, as you are\
      \ MUCH closer to the first three objectives when you respawn. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\
      \ In the last few objectives, it is a good idea to take out the <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">turret</a> on the center of the missile trailer. This will\
      \ save you trouble when trying to make it to the missile compartment. An alternate\
      \ route to the missile trailer is to jump from the repair vessel onto the <a\
      \ href=\"/Bulldog\" title=\"Bulldog\">Bulldog</a> that is drifting between the\
      \ two vehicles, and then jumping to the missile trailer from there. If you enter\
      \ the missile bay but are unable to get the missiles out, try jumping off the\
      \ sides of the upper level of the trailer when you respawn to land on the open\
      \ doors. This will give you more room to move around in than the small hatch\
      \ at the other end.</dd>\n<dt> Defensive</dt>\n<dd> For the first few objectives,\
      \ it is important to keep the offense from reaching the forward weapons cache.\
      \ The longer you can keep this strategic point out of their hands, the easier\
      \ the rest of the map will be. <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper Rifle\"\
      >Sniping</a> is very effective, as well as using the turret. You may also want\
      \ to use <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rockets</a>\
      \ on the offensive truck to keep people away from objective points.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> In the last few objectives, it is very important to use the turret\
      \ effectively right off before it gets destroyed. The turret can do much more\
      \ damage than a regular <a href=\"/Minigun\" title=\"Minigun\">Minigun</a> can\
      \ and is instant hit. You may also find sniping the two exit points from the\
      \ main truck a bit more simple to swallow. Watch for people entering the missile\
      \ bay from the open doors as this is an often used strategy once they have been\
      \ opened.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Single-Player_tips\"\

    text: "{{Infobox Map\n| title       = Convoy\n| description = This scenario is\
      \ a recreation of the recovery of the Nexus prototype missiles by the [[New\
      \ Earth Government|NEG]] military, after they were stolen by the [[Hellions]].\
      \ NEG forces pinpointed the location of the cache due to a hidden homing device\
      \ on these devastating weapons of mass destruction. The exact location of the\
      \ missiles could only be pinpointed during the short period when they were being\
      \ transferred from one location to another above ground on Taron, and the military\
      \ had no choice but to strike at this time..\n| mapimage    = AS-Convoy.gif\n\

      | music       = KR-Convoy\n| game        = UT2004\n| gametype    = Assault\n\
      }}\n\n==Map Description==\nThis map takes place across several different vehicles\
      \ racing along the desert sands of the planet Taron. The attackers begin on\
      \ a vehicle traveling alongside the Hellion repair vessel, where the defenders\
      \ tend to make their stand. The Nexus missiles are located on a trailer on the\
      \ other side of the repair vessel, so the attackers must battle their way from\
      \ vehicle to vehicle to retrieve the missiles.\n\nThe map can be considered\
      \ an updated and reimagined [[AS-HiSpeed]].\n\n==Objectives==\n;Extend the Boarding\
      \ Platform\n: This objective requires the attackers to make their way along\
      \ the length of the attack vessel to a timed switch that rotates the boarding\
      \ platform so that they can cross over to the repair vessel. When the attacker\
      \ is moved away from the switch, the platform will swing back to its original\
      \ position, but once the objective is completed, the platform will remain extended\
      \ for the rest of the mission.\n\n:The defending team spawns on the upper level\
      \ of the repair vessel, with access to several catwalks overlooking the attack\
      \ vessel. There is a [[Turrets#Unreal Tournament 2004|Minigun Turret]] and several\
      \ jumppads that propel defenders to the attack vessel. There is also a Minigun\
      \ Turret at the far end of the attack vessel, near the weapons cache. The attacking\
      \ team has a single Minigun Turret to the right of the area where they spawn.\n\
      \n;''Optional''<nowiki>:</nowiki> Open the Panel\n: At the far end of the attack\
      \ vessel is a timed switch that, when activated, will open up a panel and reveal\
      \ the \"weapons cache\". This will create a new spawn point for the attackers\
      \ that is much closer to the boarding platform, giving them a strategic advantage\
      \ in completing the first three objectives.\n;Place Explosives on the Door\n\
      : This objective is another timed switch. Attackers make their way along the\
      \ outer edge of the repair vessel to a doorway, where at least one attacker\
      \ must remain in place for X seconds in order to \"place\" the explosives.\n\
      \n: Once this objective is completed, there will be a brief countdown timer,\
      \ an explosion will blow open a hole in the door (and anyone foolish enough\
      \ to stand too close), and the attackers will have access to the lower level\
      \ of the repair vessel. The defenders will be blocked off from the catwalks\
      \ but now have access to the interior of the repair vessel.\n;Open Rear Door\n\
      : To open the rear door, attackers need to stand on an objective point near\
      \ the back of the repair vessel for several seconds. This opens the back of\
      \ the repair vessel, where a truck pulls into the vehicle bay and is raised\
      \ on a platform. A bomber plane flies in and bombs the attack vessel, killing\
      \ any players who have not moved on to the repair vessel at this point. From\
      \ the completion of this objective through the end of the match, attackers spawn\
      \ on the lower level of the repair vessel. Defenders also have a new spawn point,\
      \ on the upper level at the very front of the repair vessel. A ramp leads downward\
      \ into the interior of the repair vessel.\n\n:Also of note, there is also a\
      \ fuel truck parked in the repair vessel. Attackers can use this to jump more\
      \ easily to the next objective, but the defenders can blow it up with only a\
      \ few well-placed shots.\n;Open Side Doors\n: Attackers must activate a switch\
      \ on a raised platform at the front of the repair vessel to open side doors\
      \ at the front and rear. Standing on this objective for no more than a couple\
      \ seconds will activate the switch completely allowing the attackers access\
      \ to the Nexus Missile Trailer. After this objective is completed, the ramp\
      \ near the defenders' spawn point closes up and for the remainder of the match,\
      \ they maneuver the upper level of the repair vessel to catwalks that overlook\
      \ the Nexus missile trailer.\n;Infiltrate the Nexus Missile Trailer\n: Attackers\
      \ must jump across to the Nexus Missile Trailer, fight their way to the back\
      \ and fall down a hatch near the back to gain access to the missile bay. Defenders\
      \ have access to a [[Turrets#Unreal Tournament 2004|Minigun Turret]] on one\
      \ of the catwalks overlooking the missile trailer, and several jumppads that\
      \ will launch them to the trailer. There is also a Minigun Turret for defenders\
      \ to use on the missile trailer.\n;Retrieve the Nexus Missiles\n: At the front\
      \ of the Nexus Missile Trailer inside the missile bay, attackers must stand\
      \ on the objective for several seconds to get the missiles out of the side door.\
      \ Once this objective is completed, the match is over.\n\n== Weapons & Pickups\

      \ Vehicles and turrets ===\n* 5x Minigun Turrets\n* 8x Ceiling Sentinels\n*\
      \ 5x Floor Sentinels\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n; Offensive\n: On offense, a good\
      \ strategy in the early portion of the map is to get the forward weapons cache\
      \ as quickly as possible. This completely changes the momentum of the game from\
      \ that point on, as you are MUCH closer to the first three objectives when you\
      \ respawn. \n\n: In the last few objectives, it is a good idea to take out the\
      \ [[Turrets#Unreal Tournament 2004|turret]] on the center of the missile trailer.\
      \ This will save you trouble when trying to make it to the missile compartment.\
      \ An alternate route to the missile trailer is to jump from the repair vessel\
      \ onto the [[Bulldog]] that is drifting between the two vehicles, and then jumping\
      \ to the missile trailer from there. If you enter the missile bay but are unable\
      \ to get the missiles out, try jumping off the sides of the upper level of the\
      \ trailer when you respawn to land on the open doors. This will give you more\
      \ room to move around in than the small hatch at the other end.\n; Defensive\n\
      : For the first few objectives, it is important to keep the offense from reaching\
      \ the forward weapons cache. The longer you can keep this strategic point out\
      \ of their hands, the easier the rest of the map will be. [[Sniper Rifle|Sniping]]\
      \ is very effective, as well as using the turret. You may also want to use [[Rocket\
      \ Launcher|Rockets]] on the offensive truck to keep people away from objective\
      \ points.\n\n: In the last few objectives, it is very important to use the turret\
      \ effectively right off before it gets destroyed. The turret can do much more\
      \ damage than a regular [[Minigun]] can and is instant hit. You may also find\
      \ sniping the two exit points from the main truck a bit more simple to swallow.\
      \ Watch for people entering the missile bay from the open doors as this is an\
      \ often used strategy once they have been opened.\n==Single-Player tips==\n\
