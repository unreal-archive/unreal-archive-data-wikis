      <p>In this map the attacking team invade a large factory to destroy the AI Generator\
      \ which led to the robot's uprising on the asteroid.\nThe mission itself can\
      \ be divided into two parts. The teams start outside of the factory, where the\
      \ attackers' <a href=\"/Goliath\" title=\"Goliath\">Goliaths</a> face off against\
      \ the defenders' turrets. After the doors to the factory have been blasted both\
      \ teams continue afoot, ultimately to destroy/defend the AI Generator.\n</p><p>This\
      \ is considered an updated and reimagined <a href=\"/AS-Mazon\" title=\"AS-Mazon\"\
      >AS-Mazon</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/AS-RobotFactory?section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Objectives\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Align\
      \ the Satellite Dish</dt>\n<dd> For the first objective the attacking team must\
      \ pull a lever to align a satellite dish. The road to this objective is very\
      \ wide with plenty of cargo crates to provide cover for foot soldiers. The defending\
      \ team has a total of 3 <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"\
      Turrets\">Link Turrets</a> in 2 open areas along the way. Footsoldiers can avoid\
      \ getting hit by moving swiftly and using the crates as cover. The 2 Goliaths\
      \ the attackers have will have to take the Link Turrets down to guarantee a\
      \ safe passage. The lever itself is protected from 1 side, but the opposite\
      \ side is completely open, with another Link Turret guarding the whole area.\
      \ Trying to pull the lever (thus remaining stationary) makes the player an easy\
      \ target.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending team spawns in an area above the\
      \ first objective. Their best weapon is the set of 4 Link Turrets, which can\
      \ be operated with a console on the wall opposite of the objective. These turrets,\
      \ however, operate themselves when unused by players/bots. The <a href=\"/Grenade_Launcher\"\
      \ title=\"Grenade Launcher\">Grenade Launcher</a> in the weapon loadout could\
      \ also be used to set up a very effective ambush near the objective. </dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Destroy the Gate</dt>\n<dd> After the dish has been aligned, the attackers\
      \ must destroy the door to gain access to the factory. Along the way there's\
      \ another trench with 2 Link Turrets. This time, however, there are no obstacles\
      \ to cover footsoldiers. To make matters worse: There's a big <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Ion Cannon</a> near the objective that overlooks most of\
      \ the road towards it. Once the attackers gets closer to the doors they will\
      \ be out of the Ion Cannon's sight, and the only defense will be the team itself\
      \ which spawns nearby. Around 24 rockets will destroy the door.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> Just like the previous objective: The defending team can either use\
      \ the Link Turrets and Ion Cannon to slow the attackers and their vehicles down,\
      \ or set up an ambush near the objective. Because the road of this objective\
      \ is much more open, the Ion Cannon will have no trouble to destroy the Goliaths\
      \ at a long range. The cannon has only a limited view on the area of the objective\
      \ itself, so attackers that have already moved in can not be taken down with\
      \ the use of turrets. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Cut the Data Cables</dt>\n<dd> Once\
      \ inside the factory, the attacking team can take many routes to the next objective.\
      \ The two paths on the sides will lead to two higher-level platforms. Jumping\
      \ on the crates will lead to an <a href=\"/Shield_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Shield Pack\">Shield Pack</a> at the end. Taking the middle path will\
      \ lead to the ground-level, which is a bit quicker. The bots will be waiting\
      \ near the exit of the next room. These bots can be avoided by taking a tunnel\
      \ in the room. There's also a <a href=\"/UDamage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      UDamage\">UDamage</a> pickup in the tunnel if the defending team hasn't already\
      \ taken it. The third room is the room that will lead to the objective. Attackers\
      \ who have taken the tunnel can take a left turn and end up on the ground level\
      \ near the objective. Attackers who have taken the other (main) path can either\
      \ jump down to end up on the ground-level of the objective room, or turn left\
      \ to go to a platform from where the data cables can also be \"cut\". 8 rockets\
      \ will \"cut\" the data cables.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy Shield Component</dt>\n\
      <dd> Upon completing the previous objective a set of 2 doors opposite of the\
      \ data-cable room will open. Again there are 2 routes on 2 levels, both of which\
      \ lead to the next objective. There are 3 components in total, 2 of which are\
      \ completely open. 1 of the components, however, is partially shielded, forcing\
      \ the attackers to walk around it and shoot it from the back. Another 8 rockets\
      \ per component will complete this objective.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The hardest\
      \ part of defending these 2 objectives is guessing which route the attacking\
      \ team will take. The only passage that all of the attackers have to walk through\
      \ is the entrance to the second room (or the exit of the cargo room). Luckily\
      \ there are plenty of Shield Packs around to give the defending team an advantage\
      \ in battle.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy the AI Generator</dt>\n<dd> For the\
      \ final objective the attacking team must destroy the AI Generator, which is\
      \ located nearby. Follow the platforms and turn right near the conveyor belts,\
      \ or turn left first to get an Shield Pack. The generator is surrounded by a\
      \ circular walkway, from where the attackers must shoot the generator. There\
      \ are 3 paths the attackers can take: The walkway in the middle or the 2 tunnels\
      \ on the sides (from which the attackers can jump down on the supports of the\
      \ walkway). The generator is on a high platform, making it hard for the attackers\
      \ to aim for the generator while avoiding enemy fire. No less than 75 rockets\
      \ will be enough to complete this objective and the round. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\
      \ The defending team can make use of a series of platforms on the sides of the\
      \ room as well as the platform where the generator is located. The provided\
      \ <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"Shock Rifle\">Shock Rifle</a> and <a href=\"\
      /Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a> are both effective\
      \ in both killing the attackers and knocking them off of the walkway. The second\
      \ advantage of the defending team is that the attackers have to complete the\
      \ objective and fend off the defending team at the same time. This should distract\
      \ the attackers and give the defending team an advantage.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span\

      <dl><dt>Offensive</dt>\n<dd> While outside the attackers can make good use of\
      \ the crates and their own Goliaths to avoid the Link Turrets. Players on foot\
      \ will do best to rush to the next objective, hoping to complete it before too\
      \ much time is wasted trying to destroy all the enemy turrets. </dd>\n<dd> Once\
      \ inside, smart use of the various routes will lead to a faster victory. There\
      \ are also plenty of Shield Packs in the hallways which will aid in their quest.\
      \ In the data cable room it's also possible to hide on a pipe underneath the\
      \ platform on the 1st level. This place is harder to reach for bots.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Defensive</dt>\n<dd> Since all the Link Turrets will operate themselves,\
      \ the defenders can use more firepower to ambush incoming attackers. This is\
      \ especially valuable for the 2nd objective, where the attackers are mostly\
      \ out of the ranges of all the turrets. Inside the factory the defenders would\
      \ do best to defend the doorways where there are no alternative passages (ie\
      \ where the attackers must go through). Exploring and obtaining the Shield Packs\
      \ and UDamage before the attackers do will give the team a major advantage.</dd></dl>\n\

    text: "{{Infobox Map\n| title       = Robot Factory\n| description = This scenario\
      \ is a recreation of the Liandri robot uprising on the mechanical asteroid of\
      \ [[LBX-7683_Robot_Uprising|LBX-7683]] and the subsequent quelling of this rebellion\
      \ by human forces. LBX-7683 was an outpost for research and development of the\
      \ next generation of [[Liandri]] robots. Liandri's best scientists were able\
      \ to introduce increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence into the machines\
      \ that they designed. Eventually, they rebelled against the humans and took\
      \ the asteroid as their own, brutally disposing of their creators and mining\
      \ the rich materials embedded within the rock for their own gain. Liandri's\
      \ commanders devised a plan to strike directly at the production facility manufacturing\
      \ the robots. During an all-out assault on the world, a small team was inserted\
      \ with the sole goal of destroying the AI generators, thereby destroying the\
      \ ability of the machines to reproduce themselves and ending this uprising.\n\

      | gametype    = Assault\n}}\n\n==Map Description==\nIn this map the attacking\
      \ team invade a large factory to destroy the AI Generator which led to the robot's\
      \ uprising on the asteroid.\nThe mission itself can be divided into two parts.\
      \ The teams start outside of the factory, where the attackers' [[Goliath]]s\
      \ face off against the defenders' turrets. After the doors to the factory have\
      \ been blasted both teams continue afoot, ultimately to destroy/defend the AI\
      \ Generator.\n\nThis is considered an updated and reimagined [[AS-Mazon]].\n\
      \n==Objectives==\n\n;Align the Satellite Dish\n: For the first objective the\
      \ attacking team must pull a lever to align a satellite dish. The road to this\
      \ objective is very wide with plenty of cargo crates to provide cover for foot\
      \ soldiers. The defending team has a total of 3 [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Link\
      \ Turrets]] in 2 open areas along the way. Footsoldiers can avoid getting hit\
      \ by moving swiftly and using the crates as cover. The 2 Goliaths the attackers\
      \ have will have to take the Link Turrets down to guarantee a safe passage.\
      \ The lever itself is protected from 1 side, but the opposite side is completely\
      \ open, with another Link Turret guarding the whole area. Trying to pull the\
      \ lever (thus remaining stationary) makes the player an easy target.\n\n: The\
      \ defending team spawns in an area above the first objective. Their best weapon\
      \ is the set of 4 Link Turrets, which can be operated with a console on the\
      \ wall opposite of the objective. These turrets, however, operate themselves\
      \ when unused by players/bots. The [[Grenade Launcher]] in the weapon loadout\
      \ could also be used to set up a very effective ambush near the objective. \n\
      \n;Destroy the Gate\n: After the dish has been aligned, the attackers must destroy\
      \ the door to gain access to the factory. Along the way there's another trench\
      \ with 2 Link Turrets. This time, however, there are no obstacles to cover footsoldiers.\
      \ To make matters worse: There's a big [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Ion\
      \ Cannon]] near the objective that overlooks most of the road towards it. Once\
      \ the attackers gets closer to the doors they will be out of the Ion Cannon's\
      \ sight, and the only defense will be the team itself which spawns nearby. Around\
      \ 24 rockets will destroy the door.\n\n: Just like the previous objective: The\
      \ defending team can either use the Link Turrets and Ion Cannon to slow the\
      \ attackers and their vehicles down, or set up an ambush near the objective.\
      \ Because the road of this objective is much more open, the Ion Cannon will\
      \ have no trouble to destroy the Goliaths at a long range. The cannon has only\
      \ a limited view on the area of the objective itself, so attackers that have\
      \ already moved in can not be taken down with the use of turrets. \n\n;Cut the\
      \ Data Cables\n: Once inside the factory, the attacking team can take many routes\
      \ to the next objective. The two paths on the sides will lead to two higher-level\
      \ platforms. Jumping on the crates will lead to an [[Shield Pack]] at the end.\
      \ Taking the middle path will lead to the ground-level, which is a bit quicker.\
      \ The bots will be waiting near the exit of the next room. These bots can be\
      \ avoided by taking a tunnel in the room. There's also a [[UDamage]] pickup\
      \ in the tunnel if the defending team hasn't already taken it. The third room\
      \ is the room that will lead to the objective. Attackers who have taken the\
      \ tunnel can take a left turn and end up on the ground level near the objective.\
      \ Attackers who have taken the other (main) path can either jump down to end\
      \ up on the ground-level of the objective room, or turn left to go to a platform\
      \ from where the data cables can also be \"cut\". 8 rockets will \"cut\" the\
      \ data cables.\n\n;Destroy Shield Component\n: Upon completing the previous\
      \ objective a set of 2 doors opposite of the data-cable room will open. Again\
      \ there are 2 routes on 2 levels, both of which lead to the next objective.\
      \ There are 3 components in total, 2 of which are completely open. 1 of the\
      \ components, however, is partially shielded, forcing the attackers to walk\
      \ around it and shoot it from the back. Another 8 rockets per component will\
      \ complete this objective.\n\n: The hardest part of defending these 2 objectives\
      \ is guessing which route the attacking team will take. The only passage that\
      \ all of the attackers have to walk through is the entrance to the second room\
      \ (or the exit of the cargo room). Luckily there are plenty of Shield Packs\
      \ around to give the defending team an advantage in battle.\n\n;Destroy the\
      \ AI Generator\n: For the final objective the attacking team must destroy the\
      \ AI Generator, which is located nearby. Follow the platforms and turn right\
      \ near the conveyor belts, or turn left first to get an Shield Pack. The generator\
      \ is surrounded by a circular walkway, from where the attackers must shoot the\
      \ generator. There are 3 paths the attackers can take: The walkway in the middle\
      \ or the 2 tunnels on the sides (from which the attackers can jump down on the\
      \ supports of the walkway). The generator is on a high platform, making it hard\
      \ for the attackers to aim for the generator while avoiding enemy fire. No less\
      \ than 75 rockets will be enough to complete this objective and the round. \n\
      \n: The defending team can make use of a series of platforms on the sides of\
      \ the room as well as the platform where the generator is located. The provided\
      \ [[Shock Rifle]] and [[Rocket Launcher]] are both effective in both killing\
      \ the attackers and knocking them off of the walkway. The second advantage of\
      \ the defending team is that the attackers have to complete the objective and\
      \ fend off the defending team at the same time. This should distract the attackers\
      \ and give the defending team an advantage.\n\n== Weapons & Pickups ==\n{{sectstub}}\n\
      === Weapons ===\n=== Pickups ===\n*7x Shield Pack\n*2x [[UDamage]]\n*: 1 in\
      \ the tunnel and the other behind a crane on the far left of the outside road\
      \ (near the first trench)\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n;Offensive\n: While outside\
      \ the attackers can make good use of the crates and their own Goliaths to avoid\
      \ the Link Turrets. Players on foot will do best to rush to the next objective,\
      \ hoping to complete it before too much time is wasted trying to destroy all\
      \ the enemy turrets. \n: Once inside, smart use of the various routes will lead\
      \ to a faster victory. There are also plenty of Shield Packs in the hallways\
      \ which will aid in their quest. In the data cable room it's also possible to\
      \ hide on a pipe underneath the platform on the 1st level. This place is harder\
      \ to reach for bots.\n\n;Defensive\n: Since all the Link Turrets will operate\
      \ themselves, the defenders can use more firepower to ambush incoming attackers.\
      \ This is especially valuable for the 2nd objective, where the attackers are\
      \ mostly out of the ranges of all the turrets. Inside the factory the defenders\
      \ would do best to defend the doorways where there are no alternative passages\
      \ (ie where the attackers must go through). Exploring and obtaining the Shield\
      \ Packs and UDamage before the attackers do will give the team a major advantage.\n\
