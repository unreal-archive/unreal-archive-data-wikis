      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>With the generator wiped out, the ship is in darkness, and through the\
      \ darkened <a href=\"/Mothership_Core\" title=\"Mothership Core\">Mothership\
      \ Core</a> and <a href=\"/Mothership_Lab\" title=\"Mothership Lab\">Mothership\
      \ Lab</a> you must travel to try and gain access to <a href=\"/The_Source\"\
      \ title=\"The Source\">The Source</a>. But it won't be easy - the darkened corridors\
      \ and rooms of the ship are packed with experimental Skaarj and former detainees.\n\
      </p><p>You start once again between the two sets of doors. Go through and into\
      \ the curving corridor, where you will be attacked suddenly by a pair of <a\
      \ href=\"/Pupae\" title=\"Pupae\">Pupae</a>.\n</p><p>Kill the Pupae. Go out\
      \ into the corridor and round to the first junction. Activate your <a href=\"\
      /Searchlight\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Searchlight\">Searchlight</a> -\
      \ I'll assume for the rest of this walkthrough that you have it switched on,\
      \ because it won't run out in a hurry. Now, do you remember in MotherShip Core\
      \ the locked door to the Emergency Power Supply? That is your target for this\
      \ map. So, time to get moving.\n</p><p>The equipment cache that was behind a\
      \ force field at the end of the previous map has been revealed. Inside are two\
      \ <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flares</a>, two Health Packs, another Searchlight,\
      \ two cans of Tarydium Sludge, two cans of 12 Eightballs, and two boxes of 10\
      \ Flak Shells. Collect. You'll also see a lift at the back of this cache.\n\
      </p><p>Shortcut: I'm about to go on a detour for the sake of completeness. It\
      \ will gain you nothing but a couple of monsters to kill, but you may want to\
      \ explore the map. If you are just looking for the best route through this map,\
      \ then go down the lift in the cache, and rejoin the walkthrough later (go to\
      \ §).\n</p><p>Leave the lift and go along this upper MotherShip Core corridor.\
      \ At the first corner, you will have to fight a Pupa. There, you will be able\
      \ to hear <a href=\"/Mercenary\" title=\"Mercenary\">Mercenaries</a> talking\
      \ - don't worry too much. Continue along the corridor. At the second corner,\
      \ mind a Pupa who drops from the ceiling.\n</p><p>At the end of the corridor,\
      \ you will be back at the passageway to the raised crossroads. Go out on to\
      \ the crossroads, and you will receive a rather nasty surprise.\n</p><p>A glowing\
      \ green semi-transparent <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord\" title=\"Skaarj\
      \ Warrior\">SkaarjLord</a> sees you and dashes off down the exit to the Security\
      \ Post. Shortly it re-emerges, and comes out at you with claws outstretched.\
      \ Flak it quickly. Go out on to the crossroads. The forcefield bridge has gone,\
      \ but there was nothing to do along there anyway. The two passages back to the\
      \ cryopods area are locked - that's a shame because that would have been a quick\
      \ route.\n</p><p>That leaves three options - back to the lift at the start,\
      \ into the security post, or dropping off to the Loop below. DON'T drop off\
      \ to the Loop, I will take you down there by a better route later. If you go\
      \ into the Security Post across the platform over the core room and into the\
      \ passage beyond, all you'll find is a Pupa. So, return to the start of the\
      \ level via the corridor and go down the lift in the equipment cache.\n</p><p>§\
      \ At the bottom of the lift, you will find more gear in the form of a box of\
      \ 8 Rifle Rounds, an ASMD Core, two boxes of 50 Bullets, a Flare and a <a href=\"\
      /Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>.\
      \ Go forward into the next room - you'll come out in the very first room of\
      \ MotherShip Lab.\n</p><p>As you enter, a semi-invisible <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjBerserker</a> giving off a bright aura of blue\
      \ light sees you and sprints off. Follow him and dispose of him as quickly as\
      \ you can, because once he reaches the the junction room with the lift to the\
      \ detention area he'll turn round and lay into you. He'll take some pain, he's\
      \ tough. When he is dead, go to the aforementioned junction room.\n</p><p>Shortcut:\
      \ I'm about to take another exploration detour. Once again, if you don't want\
      \ to go, follow this shortcut. Basically, stay put (go to ¶).\n</p><p>Go to\
      \ the detention area lift and press the button. Surprisingly, it still works.\
      \ Enter the corridor - but prepare for another ethereal SkaarjBerserker who\
      \ charges down the corridor at you.\n</p><p>You can investigate the prison cells\
      \ if you want; but you'll find nothing in the corridor to the left, and all\
      \ you'll find in the other corridor are two Pupae and a dead <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjAssassin</a>. So, return to the main detention\
      \ area corridor. If you go up the ramp and into the portal junction room, you\
      \ will see that the portals are inactive, and the door to the lift down is locked.\
      \ The curving tunnel to the room with the forcefield window leads out of this\
      \ room, but although the forcefield is down you won't be able to jump up from\
      \ there anyway and all you'll find is a Pupa. This route is a no-go then. Return\
      \ to the main junction room at the bottom of the detention area lift.\n</p><p>¶\
      \ In the junction room, go through the door opposite the way you first came\
      \ into this area. You know the door I mean... the one you came back through\
      \ near the end of MotherShip Lab after going down that circular lift. The corridor\
      \ beyond leads you round into a room with a dancing electrical cable on the\
      \ ceiling; avoid the cable and go to the far end of the room. Mind the Pupae\
      \ lurking in the shadows. Follow the corridor at the far end round such that\
      \ you arrive at the bottom of the circular lift, which is still down with the\
      \ platforms extended. Go through the other doors in there, back to the staircase\
      \ that was where you started in MotherShip Core.\n</p><p>At the top of the stairs,\
      \ you arrive back at the small lift. Once it has come down, ride it back up\
      \ and you arrive in the network of corridors and rooms that I called the Loop\
      \ in the MotherShip Core walkthrough. The best route to take from there is to\
      \ the right, into the next room, where you are attacked by an ordinary <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj_Warrior#SkaarjWarrior\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a>.\n\
      </p><p>Do you remember that alcove at the bottom of of the next sloping corridor\
      \ with the gear and SkaarjBerserker in it? Well, it's accessible now, so go\
      \ down the corridor and kill the SkaarjBerserker. Kill the Pupa which attacks\
      \ from the right. Go into the alcove for the gear; a box of 10 Flak Shells,\
      \ two ASMD Cores, a Rifle Round, two cans of Tarydium Sludge and a <a href=\"\
      /Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super\
      \ Health Pack</a>. Then, leave the alcove and go straight across to the balcony\
      \ over the core room.\n</p><p>Follow the balcony round and take the walkways\
      \ round the side of the core room. You will shortly arrive in the corridor with\
      \ the security door - beware the dancing electrical cable on the ceiling - and\
      \ kill the green transparent <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjOfficer</a> with a <a href=\"/Ripper\" title=\"Ripper\"\
      >Razorjack</a> who attacks from the right. Kill him and collect his Razorjack.\n\
      </p><p>Now... the way to the Emergency Power Supply is clearly through the open\
      \ security doors and down the slope beyond. But I would urge you to take this\
      \ detour - go the other way up this corridor, past the sparkling electrical\
      \ cable and round the corner into the next stretch. There is a glowing green\
      \ transparent SkaarjBerserker there, so kill it.\n</p><p>Go along the corridor\
      \ until you arrive at the room with the ramps going down. Kill the glowing green\
      \ transparent <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\"\
      >SkaarjInfantry</a> with a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a>\
      \ on guard there and collect the Stinger that he drops, then also kill the three\
      \ Pupae who emerge from the wall opening at the back of the room down the first\
      \ set of ramps. When they are all dead, go into the wall opening yourself and\
      \ you will see that the electric barrier that was blocking off an alcove there\
      \ in MotherShip Core has gone. You can collect the gear in the alcove; two cans\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge, two ASMD Cores, two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, two\
      \ boxes of Razor Blades and an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a>.\n</p><p>If you want, you can go down\
      \ into the core room, but all you'll find are a Mercenary and a MercenaryElite\
      \ who've escaped from the detention area. So, go back up the ramps and return\
      \ to the security doors, either directly or if you're a masochist the long way\
      \ round (anticlockwise round the Loop) to fight an extra Mercenary and four\
      \ more Pupae.\n</p><p>Back at the security doors, go through and down the sloping\
      \ corridor beyond to the walkway at the bottom where you'll meet a glowing green\
      \ <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjGunner</a>\
      \ with an <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a>.\
      \ Kill him and collect the Eightball Gun that he drops. Go along the walkway\
      \ - mind the Pupae that drops down at the end - and go into the corridor at\
      \ the far end. Avoid the electrical cable there and proceed to the energy lift.\n\
      </p><p>Prepare yourself. Step on to the energy lift and it rises to the top.\
      \ Step off into the science area at the top. As you approach the Emergency Power\
      \ Supply door on the left, you are charged by an <a href=\"/Ice_Skaarj\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Ice Skaarj\">IceSkaarj</a> - it's the huge blue Skaarj\
      \ you saw in the detention area in MotherShip Lab, and it'll take a helluva\
      \ lot of punishment before it falls.\n</p><p>Kill the huge Skaarj. Watch out\
      \ as you fight for a pair of Pupae who may come out from an adjoining room.\
      \ When that area is clear, head for the big doors that the IceSkaarj was guarding.\
      \ They're the doors to the Emergency Power Supply, and they're unlocked now.\
      \ Go through.\n</p><p>You emerge in a long room. Along a metal walkway ahead\
      \ is the Emergency Power Supply unit, but it's currently inactive. Doubling\
      \ back to the left of the entrance is a locked door with a message [1].\n</p><p>There's\
      \ also a corridor out of this area. It was to the right as you entered. Go along\
      \ it, and you are in a room with a panel at the far end. Go along and read it\
      \ [2].\n</p><p>Return to the large room and climb the ramp at the entrance on\
      \ to the metal walkway. On the walkway, walk along to the far end. As you approach\
      \ the power supply unit, it rumbles into life.\n</p><p>Once the power supply\
      \ is active, look round and you will see that the message over the second set\
      \ of doors has gone. Go through to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \n\n\n==Walkthrough==\n''This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\n\
      With the generator wiped out, the ship is in darkness, and through the darkened\
      \ [[Mothership Core]] and [[Mothership Lab]] you must travel to try and gain\
      \ access to [[The Source]]. But it won't be easy - the darkened corridors and\
      \ rooms of the ship are packed with experimental Skaarj and former detainees.\n\
      \nYou start once again between the two sets of doors. Go through and into the\
      \ curving corridor, where you will be attacked suddenly by a pair of [[Pupae]].\n\
      \nKill the Pupae. Go out into the corridor and round to the first junction.\
      \ Activate your [[Searchlight]] - I'll assume for the rest of this walkthrough\
      \ that you have it switched on, because it won't run out in a hurry. Now, do\
      \ you remember in MotherShip Core the locked door to the Emergency Power Supply?\
      \ That is your target for this map. So, time to get moving.\n\nThe equipment\
      \ cache that was behind a force field at the end of the previous map has been\
      \ revealed. Inside are two [[Flare|Flares]], two Health Packs, another Searchlight,\
      \ two cans of Tarydium Sludge, two cans of 12 Eightballs, and two boxes of 10\
      \ Flak Shells. Collect. You'll also see a lift at the back of this cache.\n\n\
      Shortcut: I'm about to go on a detour for the sake of completeness. It will\
      \ gain you nothing but a couple of monsters to kill, but you may want to explore\
      \ the map. If you are just looking for the best route through this map, then\
      \ go down the lift in the cache, and rejoin the walkthrough later (go to §).\n\
      \nLeave the lift and go along this upper MotherShip Core corridor. At the first\
      \ corner, you will have to fight a Pupa. There, you will be able to hear [[Mercenary|Mercenaries]]\
      \ talking - don't worry too much. Continue along the corridor. At the second\
      \ corner, mind a Pupa who drops from the ceiling.\n\nAt the end of the corridor,\
      \ you will be back at the passageway to the raised crossroads. Go out on to\
      \ the crossroads, and you will receive a rather nasty surprise.\n\nA glowing\
      \ green semi-transparent [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord|SkaarjLord]] sees you\
      \ and dashes off down the exit to the Security Post. Shortly it re-emerges,\
      \ and comes out at you with claws outstretched. Flak it quickly. Go out on to\
      \ the crossroads. The forcefield bridge has gone, but there was nothing to do\
      \ along there anyway. The two passages back to the cryopods area are locked\
      \ - that's a shame because that would have been a quick route.\n\nThat leaves\
      \ three options - back to the lift at the start, into the security post, or\
      \ dropping off to the Loop below. DON'T drop off to the Loop, I will take you\
      \ down there by a better route later. If you go into the Security Post across\
      \ the platform over the core room and into the passage beyond, all you'll find\
      \ is a Pupa. So, return to the start of the level via the corridor and go down\
      \ the lift in the equipment cache.\n\n§ At the bottom of the lift, you will\
      \ find more gear in the form of a box of 8 Rifle Rounds, an ASMD Core, two boxes\
      \ of 50 Bullets, a Flare and a [[Shield Belt]]. Go forward into the next room\
      \ - you'll come out in the very first room of MotherShip Lab.\n\nAs you enter,\
      \ a semi-invisible [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker|SkaarjBerserker]] giving\
      \ off a bright aura of blue light sees you and sprints off. Follow him and dispose\
      \ of him as quickly as you can, because once he reaches the the junction room\
      \ with the lift to the detention area he'll turn round and lay into you. He'll\
      \ take some pain, he's tough. When he is dead, go to the aforementioned junction\
      \ room.\n\nShortcut: I'm about to take another exploration detour. Once again,\
      \ if you don't want to go, follow this shortcut. Basically, stay put (go to\
      \ ¶).\n\nGo to the detention area lift and press the button. Surprisingly, it\
      \ still works. Enter the corridor - but prepare for another ethereal SkaarjBerserker\
      \ who charges down the corridor at you.\n\nYou can investigate the prison cells\
      \ if you want; but you'll find nothing in the corridor to the left, and all\
      \ you'll find in the other corridor are two Pupae and a dead [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin|SkaarjAssassin]].\
      \ So, return to the main detention area corridor. If you go up the ramp and\
      \ into the portal junction room, you will see that the portals are inactive,\
      \ and the door to the lift down is locked. The curving tunnel to the room with\
      \ the forcefield window leads out of this room, but although the forcefield\
      \ is down you won't be able to jump up from there anyway and all you'll find\
      \ is a Pupa. This route is a no-go then. Return to the main junction room at\
      \ the bottom of the detention area lift.\n\n¶ In the junction room, go through\
      \ the door opposite the way you first came into this area. You know the door\
      \ I mean... the one you came back through near the end of MotherShip Lab after\
      \ going down that circular lift. The corridor beyond leads you round into a\
      \ room with a dancing electrical cable on the ceiling; avoid the cable and go\
      \ to the far end of the room. Mind the Pupae lurking in the shadows. Follow\
      \ the corridor at the far end round such that you arrive at the bottom of the\
      \ circular lift, which is still down with the platforms extended. Go through\
      \ the other doors in there, back to the staircase that was where you started\
      \ in MotherShip Core.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, you arrive back at the small\
      \ lift. Once it has come down, ride it back up and you arrive in the network\
      \ of corridors and rooms that I called the Loop in the MotherShip Core walkthrough.\
      \ The best route to take from there is to the right, into the next room, where\
      \ you are attacked by an ordinary [[Skaarj_Warrior#SkaarjWarrior|SkaarjWarrior]].\n\
      \nDo you remember that alcove at the bottom of of the next sloping corridor\
      \ with the gear and SkaarjBerserker in it? Well, it's accessible now, so go\
      \ down the corridor and kill the SkaarjBerserker. Kill the Pupa which attacks\
      \ from the right. Go into the alcove for the gear; a box of 10 Flak Shells,\
      \ two ASMD Cores, a Rifle Round, two cans of Tarydium Sludge and a [[Super Health\
      \ Pack]]. Then, leave the alcove and go straight across to the balcony over\
      \ the core room.\n\nFollow the balcony round and take the walkways round the\
      \ side of the core room. You will shortly arrive in the corridor with the security\
      \ door - beware the dancing electrical cable on the ceiling - and kill the green\
      \ transparent [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer|SkaarjOfficer]] with a [[Ripper|Razorjack]]\
      \ who attacks from the right. Kill him and collect his Razorjack.\n\nNow...\
      \ the way to the Emergency Power Supply is clearly through the open security\
      \ doors and down the slope beyond. But I would urge you to take this detour\
      \ - go the other way up this corridor, past the sparkling electrical cable and\
      \ round the corner into the next stretch. There is a glowing green transparent\
      \ SkaarjBerserker there, so kill it.\n\nGo along the corridor until you arrive\
      \ at the room with the ramps going down. Kill the glowing green transparent\
      \ [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry|SkaarjInfantry]] with a [[Stinger]] on guard\
      \ there and collect the Stinger that he drops, then also kill the three Pupae\
      \ who emerge from the wall opening at the back of the room down the first set\
      \ of ramps. When they are all dead, go into the wall opening yourself and you\
      \ will see that the electric barrier that was blocking off an alcove there in\
      \ MotherShip Core has gone. You can collect the gear in the alcove; two cans\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge, two ASMD Cores, two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, two\
      \ boxes of Razor Blades and an [[Assault Vest]].\n\nIf you want, you can go\
      \ down into the core room, but all you'll find are a Mercenary and a MercenaryElite\
      \ who've escaped from the detention area. So, go back up the ramps and return\
      \ to the security doors, either directly or if you're a masochist the long way\
      \ round (anticlockwise round the Loop) to fight an extra Mercenary and four\
      \ more Pupae.\n\nBack at the security doors, go through and down the sloping\
      \ corridor beyond to the walkway at the bottom where you'll meet a glowing green\
      \ [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner|SkaarjGunner]] with an [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball\
      \ Gun]]. Kill him and collect the Eightball Gun that he drops. Go along the\
      \ walkway - mind the Pupae that drops down at the end - and go into the corridor\
      \ at the far end. Avoid the electrical cable there and proceed to the energy\
      \ lift.\n\nPrepare yourself. Step on to the energy lift and it rises to the\
      \ top. Step off into the science area at the top. As you approach the Emergency\
      \ Power Supply door on the left, you are charged by an [[Ice_Skaarj|IceSkaarj]]\
      \ - it's the huge blue Skaarj you saw in the detention area in MotherShip Lab,\
      \ and it'll take a helluva lot of punishment before it falls.\n\nKill the huge\
      \ Skaarj. Watch out as you fight for a pair of Pupae who may come out from an\
      \ adjoining room. When that area is clear, head for the big doors that the IceSkaarj\
      \ was guarding. They're the doors to the Emergency Power Supply, and they're\
      \ unlocked now. Go through.\n\nYou emerge in a long room. Along a metal walkway\
      \ ahead is the Emergency Power Supply unit, but it's currently inactive. Doubling\
      \ back to the left of the entrance is a locked door with a message [1].\n\n\
      There's also a corridor out of this area. It was to the right as you entered.\
      \ Go along it, and you are in a room with a panel at the far end. Go along and\
      \ read it [2].\n\nReturn to the large room and climb the ramp at the entrance\
      \ on to the metal walkway. On the walkway, walk along to the far end. As you\
      \ approach the power supply unit, it rumbles into life.\n\nOnce the power supply\
      \ is active, look round and you will see that the message over the second set\
      \ of doors has gone. Go through to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n\
