      \ access tunnel towards the power station bordering the dam. Activating the\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Objectives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Infiltrate the Base</dt>\n<dd> This objective\
      \ comes (more or less) in two parts: cross the icy river and then get into the\
      \ base. There are a couple methods for attackers to get across the river and\
      \ start the assault. The most common way would be to use the floating chunks\
      \ of ice to hop across. Swimming can help attackers remain hidden, but it is\
      \ usually too slow to bother with. Another method is to jump onto one of the\
      \ trusses crossing the river above. This is slightly less conspicuous, but it\
      \ is still easy to be picked off by a sniper.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Once on solid\
      \ ground, the main objective is to force your way into the base. Walk up to\
      \ either of the doors to the base to start opening it and slip in once you can\
      \ fit through. Defenders should be mindful that they can inadvertently open\
      \ the doors too, which only helps the attackers. As such, defenders should drop\
      \ through the hole in the upper level to get outside rather than go to the main\
      \ level and use the doors.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt><i>Optional</i>: Raise the Bridge</dt>\n\
      <dd> There's a third way to get to the base entrance, but it involves getting\
      \ across the river first. There is a small room to the attackers' right as they\
      \ reach the shore, with a switch on the wall. Stand next to the switch to raise\
      \ a bridge from underwater, allowing for quicker assaults on the base. However,\
      \ be wary that while this allows the attackers a quicker way across it also\
      \ allows the defense to play more forward and aggressively as they can use the\
      \ bridge too.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Activate the Ion Core</dt>\n<dd> Once the base\
      \ has been infiltrated the two doors will open up completely. The attackers\
      \ now must activate two ion core switches in the center of the base. These are\
      \ essentially right under where the defenders spawn, often making this a difficult\
      \ objective to procure, because the attackers still spawn way across the bridge.\
      \ To get to the switches, attackers must traverse two narrow hallways (the right\
      \ being shorter than the left), making their job even more difficult due to\
      \ the effectiveness of spam. Once these are activated, the bay doors by the\
      \ ion core will open, allowing attackers to enter the <a href=\"/Ion_Plasma_Tank\"\
      \ title=\"Ion Plasma Tank\">Ion Plasma Tank</a> area.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Capture\
      \ the Tank</dt>\n<dd> Once the bay doors are open, attackers no longer need\
      \ to go through the narrow hallways, though they will still be spawning across\
      \ the bridge. Again, this can make things difficult as the trip is a long one.\
      \ All the attackers need to do, however, is get next to the tank and enter it.\
      \ Usually the next course of action is to shoot the pillar to the immediate\
      \ left of the tank's parking spot to clear the area of defenders.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Destroy Access Doors</dt>\n<dd> After the area is relatively defender-free,\
      \ drive forward a bit and use the tank to destroy the large red door to the\
      \ left. This activates new spawn points opposite the tank spawn point for the\
      \ attackers. Once the door is destroyed, take the tank through it and up the\
      \ tunnel.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Once the tank gets to the midway point of the\
      \ access tunnel, the announcer will advise the players that \"the access tunnel\
      \ is secured.\" This moves the spawn point of the attackers, including the tank,\
      \ forward to that location.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Open Security Gate</dt>\n<dd>\
      \ From the new spawn point, attackers must again travel upwards in the tunnel\
      \ to arrive at the next building, and again the area is set up to be a defensive\
      \ stronghold complete with minigun turrets and a large gate to the right. The\
      \ switch is placed at the back of the building in its own highly-defendable\
      \ room. There are initially two foot entrances to the sides under the minigun\
      \ turrets, but if the attackers can manage to drive the tank onto the platform\
      \ in front of the building, a third door will lower. This allows the tank to\
      \ shoot into the building and clear the switch room of defenders. Once the switch\
      \ is activated, the gate to the right will slowly open. The attackers spawn\
      \ is moved forward to in front of this building.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Shutdown\
      \ Primary Dam</dt>\n<dd> Proceed to the next building. There are two steps to\
      \ completing this objective. First, the dam controls must be destroyed. They\
      \ lie in the lower portion of the building and can take about 1500 damage. Defenders\
      \ spawn in the upper areas of the building and can either run out to the large\
      \ overhang or drop down into the control room.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy the\
      \ Depot Door</dt>\n<dd> Once the dam controls are destroyed, the shielding over\
      \ the large door fails and the door can be destroyed with a tank shot. Move\
      \ through to activate new spawns.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Shutdown Secondary Dam</dt>\n\
      <dd> Like the first dam, the controls must be destroyed here in a similar fashion.\
      \ Once these are destroyed the final gate will open and the final spawn points\
      \ are activated.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy the Blast Door</dt>\n<dd> If the\
      \ map doesn't end in a stalemate around the ion core objectives, this one is\
      \ the next likely place. The attackers, even with their precious ion tank, have\
      \ their work seriously cut out for them. The blast door can only be damaged\
      \ by the tank and takes two full shots to dispatch of. The problem here is that\
      \ it's set well within the building, making it hard to get a clean shot off.\
      \ All the while the defenders will be concentrating on taking that tank out,\
      \ which is easy because it's so slow. The attackers should take the longer left\
      \ route around the mountain to destroy the door because it eventually provides\
      \ a clear shot if the tank can make it.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Escape the Base</dt>\n\
      <dd> Once the blast door is disposed of, attackers need to simply drive it out.\
      \ This sounds a lot easier than it is as defenders will spawn right in your\
      \ path and have instant access to link plasma and rockets, both great at damaging\
      \ the tank. Take the right route as it is shorter and drive through the broken\
      \ blast doors to complete the level.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ the tank). Not only does it heal the tank but its plasma is good for destroying\
      \ the dam controls. To actually manage to complete the last two objectives,\
      \ it is imperative that nearly everyone on the team link up to the tank to keep\
      \ its heal rate up as high as possible. This is can be difficult due to the\
      \ limited ammo on the last spawn, however.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Having a good\
      \ tank driver can make this map a breeze. He should generally be shooting nonstop\
      \ into the key areas and into the spawn points. For instance, on the dam control\
      \ objectives, shooting up near the overhang can take out many newly-spawned\
      \ players, while it's also possible to line up shots into the control rooms\
      \ themselves, taking out all the defenders inside.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> There\
      \ are many \"exploits\" (or \"options\" depending on how you look at it) available\
      \ to the attackers if they know where to look. For example, it's possible to\
      \ walk on the base by the river, enter the security gate building from the second\
      \ floor, shoot the dam controls from outside, and even get up to the second-floor\
      \ spawn points in the second dam control building. It is not certain whether\

      \ Glacier is linear in design and thus rife with choke points, and these should\
      \ be used to the defenders' advantage. Taking out the tank quickly can make\
      \ it easier to defend the objectives, but they mustn't ignore the other players,\
      \ especially since the tank will just respawn and come right back.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> On the last two objectives, the only real goal is to take out that\
      \ tank as quickly as possible. This can be made easier if you take out the attackers\
      \ linking to it first.</dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Single-Player_tips\"\

      \ daring acts of the mostly covert Corporation Wars, [[Izanagi Corporation|Izanagi]]\
      \ Corporation's research facility on Lamdon 3 was raided and destroyed by a\
      \ strike force from the [[Axon Research Corporation]], despite the protection\
      \ offered by the elite [[New Earth Government|NEG]] [[Thunder Crash|Thundercrash]]\
      \ force. This scenario recreates that mission. Axon was able to not only destroy\
      \ the facility, but also retrieve the advanced plasma ion tank under development\
      \ there. You must infiltrate the facility, steal the [[Ion Plasma Tank|ion plasma\
      \ tank]], and destroy the entire facility.\n| mapimage    = AS-Glacier.gif\n\

      \ = Assault\n}}\n\n==Map Description==\nThis map takes place at an [[Izanagi]]\
      \ research station on Lamdon 3. The attackers must cross a frozen lake to infiltrate\
      \ the research station, activate the ion core that powers the station, steal\
      \ the ion tank, and proceed up an access tunnel towards the power station bordering\
      \ the dam. Activating the power station will open the gateway to allow the attackers\
      \ to cross the dam, overload the two hydroelectric stations there, and blow\
      \ open an outer door that will allow the tank to escape the station before it\
      \ goes up in a ball of fire.\n\nThe map can be considered an updated and reimagined\
      \ [[AS-Guardia]].\n\n==Objectives==\n;Infiltrate the Base\n: This objective\
      \ comes (more or less) in two parts: cross the icy river and then get into the\
      \ base. There are a couple methods for attackers to get across the river and\
      \ start the assault. The most common way would be to use the floating chunks\
      \ of ice to hop across. Swimming can help attackers remain hidden, but it is\
      \ usually too slow to bother with. Another method is to jump onto one of the\
      \ trusses crossing the river above. This is slightly less conspicuous, but it\
      \ is still easy to be picked off by a sniper.\n\n: Once on solid ground, the\
      \ main objective is to force your way into the base. Walk up to either of the\
      \ doors to the base to start opening it and slip in once you can fit through.\
      \ Defenders should be mindful that they can inadvertently open the doors too,\
      \ which only helps the attackers. As such, defenders should drop through the\
      \ hole in the upper level to get outside rather than go to the main level and\
      \ use the doors.\n\n;''Optional''<nowiki>:</nowiki> Raise the Bridge\n: There's\
      \ a third way to get to the base entrance, but it involves getting across the\
      \ river first. There is a small room to the attackers' right as they reach the\
      \ shore, with a switch on the wall. Stand next to the switch to raise a bridge\
      \ from underwater, allowing for quicker assaults on the base. However, be wary\
      \ that while this allows the attackers a quicker way across it also allows the\
      \ defense to play more forward and aggressively as they can use the bridge too.\n\
      \n;Activate the Ion Core\n: Once the base has been infiltrated the two doors\
      \ will open up completely. The attackers now must activate two ion core switches\
      \ in the center of the base. These are essentially right under where the defenders\
      \ spawn, often making this a difficult objective to procure, because the attackers\
      \ still spawn way across the bridge. To get to the switches, attackers must\
      \ traverse two narrow hallways (the right being shorter than the left), making\
      \ their job even more difficult due to the effectiveness of spam. Once these\
      \ are activated, the bay doors by the ion core will open, allowing attackers\
      \ to enter the [[Ion Plasma Tank]] area.\n\n;Capture the Tank\n: Once the bay\
      \ doors are open, attackers no longer need to go through the narrow hallways,\
      \ though they will still be spawning across the bridge. Again, this can make\
      \ things difficult as the trip is a long one. All the attackers need to do,\
      \ however, is get next to the tank and enter it. Usually the next course of\
      \ action is to shoot the pillar to the immediate left of the tank's parking\
      \ spot to clear the area of defenders.\n\n;Destroy Access Doors\n: After the\
      \ area is relatively defender-free, drive forward a bit and use the tank to\
      \ destroy the large red door to the left. This activates new spawn points opposite\
      \ the tank spawn point for the attackers. Once the door is destroyed, take the\
      \ tank through it and up the tunnel.\n\n: Once the tank gets to the midway point\
      \ of the access tunnel, the announcer will advise the players that \"the access\
      \ tunnel is secured.\" This moves the spawn point of the attackers, including\
      \ the tank, forward to that location.\n\n;Open Security Gate\n: From the new\
      \ spawn point, attackers must again travel upwards in the tunnel to arrive at\
      \ the next building, and again the area is set up to be a defensive stronghold\
      \ complete with minigun turrets and a large gate to the right. The switch is\
      \ placed at the back of the building in its own highly-defendable room. There\
      \ are initially two foot entrances to the sides under the minigun turrets, but\
      \ if the attackers can manage to drive the tank onto the platform in front of\
      \ the building, a third door will lower. This allows the tank to shoot into\
      \ the building and clear the switch room of defenders. Once the switch is activated,\
      \ the gate to the right will slowly open. The attackers spawn is moved forward\
      \ to in front of this building.\n\n;Shutdown Primary Dam\n: Proceed to the next\
      \ building. There are two steps to completing this objective. First, the dam\
      \ controls must be destroyed. They lie in the lower portion of the building\
      \ and can take about 1500 damage. Defenders spawn in the upper areas of the\
      \ building and can either run out to the large overhang or drop down into the\
      \ control room.\n\n;Destroy the Depot Door\n: Once the dam controls are destroyed,\
      \ the shielding over the large door fails and the door can be destroyed with\
      \ a tank shot. Move through to activate new spawns.\n\n;Shutdown Secondary Dam\n\
      : Like the first dam, the controls must be destroyed here in a similar fashion.\
      \ Once these are destroyed the final gate will open and the final spawn points\
      \ are activated.\n\n;Destroy the Blast Door\n: If the map doesn't end in a stalemate\
      \ around the ion core objectives, this one is the next likely place. The attackers,\
      \ even with their precious ion tank, have their work seriously cut out for them.\
      \ The blast door can only be damaged by the tank and takes two full shots to\
      \ dispatch of. The problem here is that it's set well within the building, making\
      \ it hard to get a clean shot off. All the while the defenders will be concentrating\
      \ on taking that tank out, which is easy because it's so slow. The attackers\
      \ should take the longer left route around the mountain to destroy the door\
      \ because it eventually provides a clear shot if the tank can make it.\n\n;Escape\
      \ the Base\n: Once the blast door is disposed of, attackers need to simply drive\
      \ it out. This sounds a lot easier than it is as defenders will spawn right\
      \ in your path and have instant access to link plasma and rockets, both great\
      \ at damaging the tank. Take the right route as it is shorter and drive through\
      \ the broken blast doors to complete the level.\n\n== Weapons & Pickups ==\n\
      {{sectstub}}\n=== Weapons ===\n=== Pickups ===\nYou'll generally find pickups\
      \ \"hidden\" inside the large crates that are scattered everywhere. The keg\
      \ is in one by the left base door for the first few objectives, the amp lies\
      \ to the side of tunnel exit on the security gate objective, and the 100 armor\
      \ is in one near the first dam controls. There are 50 armors scattered around\
      \ various spawn points both for attackers and defenders.\n=== Vehicles and turrets\
      \ ===\n* 1x [[Ion Plasma Tank]].\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n;Offensive\n: On offense\
      \ the [[Link Gun]] is one of your best assets (beside the tank). Not only does\
      \ it heal the tank but its plasma is good for destroying the dam controls. To\
      \ actually manage to complete the last two objectives, it is imperative that\
      \ nearly everyone on the team link up to the tank to keep its heal rate up as\
      \ high as possible. This is can be difficult due to the limited ammo on the\
      \ last spawn, however.\n\n: Having a good tank driver can make this map a breeze.\
      \ He should generally be shooting nonstop into the key areas and into the spawn\
      \ points. For instance, on the dam control objectives, shooting up near the\
      \ overhang can take out many newly-spawned players, while it's also possible\
      \ to line up shots into the control rooms themselves, taking out all the defenders\
      \ inside.\n\n: There are many \"exploits\" (or \"options\" depending on how\
      \ you look at it) available to the attackers if they know where to look. For\
      \ example, it's possible to walk on the base by the river, enter the security\
      \ gate building from the second floor, shoot the dam controls from outside,\
      \ and even get up to the second-floor spawn points in the second dam control\
      \ building. It is not certain whether or not such actions are condoned.\n\n\
      ;Defensive\n: Glacier is linear in design and thus rife with choke points, and\
      \ these should be used to the defenders' advantage. Taking out the tank quickly\
      \ can make it easier to defend the objectives, but they mustn't ignore the other\
      \ players, especially since the tank will just respawn and come right back.\n\
      \n: On the last two objectives, the only real goal is to take out that tank\
      \ as quickly as possible. This can be made easier if you take out the attackers\
      \ linking to it first.\n\n===Single-Player tips===\n{{sectstub}}\n{{Prevnext|AS-Convoy|AS-Junkyard|UT2004\
      \ AS Ladder}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to the official Unreal [[timeline]],\
      \ the whole raid took place in 2260.\n* Given the description of the map, Malcolm's\
      \ team, [[Thunder Crash]], was already hired by Izanagi prior to the events\
      \ of [[Unreal Tournament 3]]'s [[UT3 Single Player|events]], where Malcolm himself\
      \ leads an Izanagi team throughout the campaign.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Corporation\
