      <p>In this scenario the attackers must steal a prototype jumpship. First a few\
      \ objectives must be completed using Space Fighters, after which the teams respawn\
      \ inside the jumpship. Here both team must fight each other to complete/defend\
      \ the objectives, without the use of Turrets or pickups such as Health- and\
      \ Shield Packs. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span><span\

      \ href=\"/edit/AS-BP2-Jumpship?section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Objectives\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Destroy\
      \ Hydraulic Valves</dt>\n<dd> The first objective is to destroy the 4 Hydraulic\
      \ Valves using <a href=\"/Human_Space_Fighter\" title=\"Human Space Fighter\"\
      >Human Space Fighters</a>. The Valves are located on the 4 corners of the bottom\
      \ part of the ship (the construction dock). Each Hydraulic Valve is protected\
      \ by an <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"Turrets\">Energy\
      \ Turret</a> on the top of the  dock. Since the construction dock is shaped\
      \ like a T profile, the top ledge will provide some coverage from the Energy\
      \ Turrets. This, however, requires the attackers to fly very close to the dock,\
      \ making them an easier target for the defender's <a href=\"/Skaarj_Space_Fighter\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Space Fighter\">Skaarj Space Fighters</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Enter\
      \ Jumpship</dt>\n<dd> The next objective is quite simple: Fly the Human Space\
      \ Fighter into the Docking Bay located on the front of the main ship. There\
      \ are no additional turrets to protect this objective, but 2 of the 4 previously\
      \ mentioned Energy Turrets guard most of the space underneath the main ship.\
      \ Attackers who wish to avoid this may take a route over the top of the main\
      \ ship, where there are no turrets.  </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending team\
      \ can only use their Skaarj Space Fighters in their defense. For the first objective\
      \ the defenders would do best to try to prevent the attacking team from getting\
      \ too close to the construction dock, where they can avoid the Energy Turret's\
      \ fire. The second objective requires the attackers to travel a small distance\
      \ to the front of the ship. There are no big objects to cover the attackers\
      \ on this route, making them vulnerable. If all else fails the defending team\
      \ can also wait for the attackers near the landing bay and kamikaze by flying\
      \ into the attackers. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy Thermal Control Regulator</dt>\n\
      <dd> The rest of the mission will take place inside the ship. First the attacking\
      \ team must destroy a panel in a room near the docking bays. When exiting the\
      \ bay, a short corridor will take the attackers to a large room with cooling\
      \ pipes. The panel is in the middle of the room, on the front of a large piece\
      \ of machinery (with horizontal cooling pipes on both sides). Attackers can\
      \ also use these pipes to climb on top of the machine and surprise the defenders.\
      \ Finally the attackers can also walk over to the defending team's weapon locker\
      \ to get better weapons and even out the odds.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> There are\
      \ no pickups available for either side. The defending team's advantage lies\
      \ in the weapon loadout (which includes a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"\
      Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a> and <a href=\"/Bio-Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Bio-Rifle\">Bio-Rifle</a> and the more convenient spawnpoints. Defending\
      \ bots usually clog up the area in front up the panel to defend it. Although\
      \ this is tactically the best point to battle the attackers from, it's also\
      \ risky to get let the attacking team come so close to the objective. Be careful\
      \ when trying to get to the attacker's spawnpoints: Most of the route is protected\
      \ by <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"Turrets\"> Ceiling\
      \ Sentinels</a></dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Activate the Navigation Computer</dt>\n<dd>\
      \ After the panel has been destroyed the door facing the panel will open. This\
      \ door leads to a very short corridor with another door on the other side. Behind\
      \ those doors is a room with a panel in the middle. The attacking team must\
      \ reach that panel to complete this objective. Since the corridor is so short\
      \ and the room with the panel isn't very large, it can be reached with 2 simple\
      \ dodge-jumps. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending team will have to take preventive\
      \ measures in order to try and stall the attackers on this objective. Since\
      \ the attackers can reach the panel within a couple of seconds, only a lucky\
      \ shot or pre-planned trap (using the Bio Rifle) will stop an attacker from\
      \ immediately achieving the objective.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Activate Jump Engines</dt>\n\
      <dd> There are 2 more doors in this newly acquired room, which lead to both\
      \ ends of the Jump Engine room. The corridors leading from these doors eventually\
      \ split. On one side of this split there is a door, and on the other side the\
      \ corridor continues. The door provides the fastest route to the Jump Engines,\
      \ but it's also the better defended route. The other route in the corridor is\
      \ a back route, which takes longer but also lets the attackers bypass most of\
      \ the defending team. Both Jump Engines are connected to each other with a walkway.\
      \ The defending team will usually be standing on or next to this walkway. The\
      \ teleporter in the middle of this walkway leads to the defending team's spawnroom.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The defending teams spawns in the bridge of the ship, which is conveniently\
      \ connected to the Jump Engine room via a teleporter, with the other end being\
      \ in between the 2 Jump Engines. Like before: There are no major advantages\
      \ for the defending team, other than the location of the spawpoints. In fact:\
      \ If a member of the attacking team still has a Flak Cannon, than it puts the\
      \ attackers at an advantage. Tactical positioning is the key to a successful\
      \ defense here. Clogging up one of the entrances of the room like the bots do\
      \ will result in failure.  </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Program Jump Coordinates</dt>\n\
      <dd> A new objective and another set of doors has been opened. 2 short corridors\
      \ and 2 turns will lead the attacking team to the Router room. There are 4 elevators\
      \ leading to the upper level (where the last 2 objectives are): 1 in each corner\
      \ of the room. A series of pipes block a direct route to the 2 closest elevators,\
      \ so the attackers must go to the far side of the room first. The elevators\
      \ there will take the attackers to the front of the upper room (where most of\
      \ the defenders will be waiting). The other 2 elevators will allow the attacker\
      \ to take a backroute to the panel. The panel for this objective is in the back\
      \ of the room, in between the 2 big pieces of machinery. As usual the defending\
      \ team will be clogging up the area in front of the objective. As mentioned\
      \ before: a back road can be taken where the attackers can get on the machine\
      \ behind the panel and surprise the defending team.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Once\
      \ again the defending team doesn't have any pickups to help them. Attackers\
      \ can come from all sides (though bots won't jump over the machine behind the\
      \ panel). There is a Bio-Rifle in a weapon lockers though, which can be used\
      \ in setting up traps for the attacking team (like in the elevator shafts, for\
      \ example)</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy Computer Routers</dt>\n<dd> The last objective\
      \ is in the same room as the previous one. This time a set of 2 Routers must\
      \ be destroyed. The Routers are very exposed and can be shot at from most of\
      \ the room. As if that isn't enough, they are also weak, making it even easier\
      \ to destroy them. 5 Flak shells destroys a Router, and destroying both Routers\
      \ finishes the round.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The best thing that the defending\
      \ team can do is trying to prevent the attackers from even reaching the room,\
      \ since the Routers are over-exposed. As mentioned before, shooting blobs form\
      \ the Bio-Rifle down the elevator shaft is a effective tactic. The best place\
      \ to battle the attacking team is on the lower level of the Router room. The\
      \ rest of the route to the attacker's spawnpoints is protected by Ceiling Sentinels,\
      \ making is unsafe for the defending team.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      <dl><dt>Offensive</dt>\n<dd> One of the few advantages the defending team has\
      \ is a better weapon loadout. The weapon lockers are often located on or near\
      \ the main route to the objective, meaning that the attacking team could get\
      \ these weapons too, giving them a better chance. Since there is no ammunition\
      \ around, a long survival could result in the depletion of one's ammo. A tactical\
      \ attacker/defender will consider planning his/her death or even suicide in\
      \ order to get a full weapon loadout again (including plenty of ammo)</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Defensive</dt>\n<dd> With the defending team having little defensive\
      \ means, tactical positioning is the key to success in this mission. The Bio-Rifle\
      \ allows them to set up traps occasionally. Other than that the defenders will\
      \ have to explore the ship's layout and discover the best points to defend the\
      \ objectives from, or to plan a surprise attack from. The more convenient spawnpoints\
      \ allows the defenders to face the attackers on their route to the objective,\
      \ instead of having to wait near the objective for the attackers to come.</dd></dl>\n\

    text: "{{Infobox Map\n| title       = Jumpship\n| description = During the height\
      \ of the Corporation Wars, [[Liandri]] scientists created a prototype Warship\
      \ capable of making its own jumps without the need for a jumpgate.  Shortly\
      \ before its maiden voyage, [[Izanagi]] spies learned of the prototype Jumpship\
      \ and launched an operation to steal it.  This scenario recreates the historic\
      \ battle in which Izanagi forces infiltrated the prototype Liandri Jumpship,\
      \ activated its engines, and made a successful jump to Izanagi space.\n| mapimage\

      \ (MegaPack)\n| gametype    = Assault\n}}\n\n==Map Description==\n\nIn this\
      \ scenario the attackers must steal a prototype jumpship. First a few objectives\
      \ must be completed using Space Fighters, after which the teams respawn inside\
      \ the jumpship. Here both team must fight each other to complete/defend the\
      \ objectives, without the use of Turrets or pickups such as Health- and Shield\
      \ Packs. \n\n==Objectives==\n;Destroy Hydraulic Valves\n: The first objective\
      \ is to destroy the 4 Hydraulic Valves using [[Human Space Fighter]]s. The Valves\
      \ are located on the 4 corners of the bottom part of the ship (the construction\
      \ dock). Each Hydraulic Valve is protected by an [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Energy\
      \ Turret]] on the top of the  dock. Since the construction dock is shaped like\
      \ a T profile, the top ledge will provide some coverage from the Energy Turrets.\
      \ This, however, requires the attackers to fly very close to the dock, making\
      \ them an easier target for the defender's [[Skaarj Space Fighter]]s.\n\n;Enter\
      \ Jumpship\n: The next objective is quite simple: Fly the Human Space Fighter\
      \ into the Docking Bay located on the front of the main ship. There are no additional\
      \ turrets to protect this objective, but 2 of the 4 previously mentioned Energy\
      \ Turrets guard most of the space underneath the main ship. Attackers who wish\
      \ to avoid this may take a route over the top of the main ship, where there\
      \ are no turrets.  \n\n: The defending team can only use their Skaarj Space\
      \ Fighters in their defense. For the first objective the defenders would do\
      \ best to try to prevent the attacking team from getting too close to the construction\
      \ dock, where they can avoid the Energy Turret's fire. The second objective\
      \ requires the attackers to travel a small distance to the front of the ship.\
      \ There are no big objects to cover the attackers on this route, making them\
      \ vulnerable. If all else fails the defending team can also wait for the attackers\
      \ near the landing bay and kamikaze by flying into the attackers. \n\n;Destroy\
      \ Thermal Control Regulator\n: The rest of the mission will take place inside\
      \ the ship. First the attacking team must destroy a panel in a room near the\
      \ docking bays. When exiting the bay, a short corridor will take the attackers\
      \ to a large room with cooling pipes. The panel is in the middle of the room,\
      \ on the front of a large piece of machinery (with horizontal cooling pipes\
      \ on both sides). Attackers can also use these pipes to climb on top of the\
      \ machine and surprise the defenders. Finally the attackers can also walk over\
      \ to the defending team's weapon locker to get better weapons and even out the\
      \ odds.\n\n: There are no pickups available for either side. The defending team's\
      \ advantage lies in the weapon loadout (which includes a [[Flak Cannon]] and\
      \ [[Bio-Rifle]] and the more convenient spawnpoints. Defending bots usually\
      \ clog up the area in front up the panel to defend it. Although this is tactically\
      \ the best point to battle the attackers from, it's also risky to get let the\
      \ attacking team come so close to the objective. Be careful when trying to get\
      \ to the attacker's spawnpoints: Most of the route is protected by [[Turrets#Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2004 | Ceiling Sentinel]]s\n \n;Activate the Navigation Computer\n\
      : After the panel has been destroyed the door facing the panel will open. This\
      \ door leads to a very short corridor with another door on the other side. Behind\
      \ those doors is a room with a panel in the middle. The attacking team must\
      \ reach that panel to complete this objective. Since the corridor is so short\
      \ and the room with the panel isn't very large, it can be reached with 2 simple\
      \ dodge-jumps. \n\n: The defending team will have to take preventive measures\
      \ in order to try and stall the attackers on this objective. Since the attackers\
      \ can reach the panel within a couple of seconds, only a lucky shot or pre-planned\
      \ trap (using the Bio Rifle) will stop an attacker from immediately achieving\
      \ the objective.\n\n;Activate Jump Engines\n: There are 2 more doors in this\
      \ newly acquired room, which lead to both ends of the Jump Engine room. The\
      \ corridors leading from these doors eventually split. On one side of this split\
      \ there is a door, and on the other side the corridor continues. The door provides\
      \ the fastest route to the Jump Engines, but it's also the better defended route.\
      \ The other route in the corridor is a back route, which takes longer but also\
      \ lets the attackers bypass most of the defending team. Both Jump Engines are\
      \ connected to each other with a walkway. The defending team will usually be\
      \ standing on or next to this walkway. The teleporter in the middle of this\
      \ walkway leads to the defending team's spawnroom.\n\n: The defending teams\
      \ spawns in the bridge of the ship, which is conveniently connected to the Jump\
      \ Engine room via a teleporter, with the other end being in between the 2 Jump\
      \ Engines. Like before: There are no major advantages for the defending team,\
      \ other than the location of the spawpoints. In fact: If a member of the attacking\
      \ team still has a Flak Cannon, than it puts the attackers at an advantage.\
      \ Tactical positioning is the key to a successful defense here. Clogging up\
      \ one of the entrances of the room like the bots do will result in failure.\
      \  \n\n;Program Jump Coordinates\n: A new objective and another set of doors\
      \ has been opened. 2 short corridors and 2 turns will lead the attacking team\
      \ to the Router room. There are 4 elevators leading to the upper level (where\
      \ the last 2 objectives are): 1 in each corner of the room. A series of pipes\
      \ block a direct route to the 2 closest elevators, so the attackers must go\
      \ to the far side of the room first. The elevators there will take the attackers\
      \ to the front of the upper room (where most of the defenders will be waiting).\
      \ The other 2 elevators will allow the attacker to take a backroute to the panel.\
      \ The panel for this objective is in the back of the room, in between the 2\
      \ big pieces of machinery. As usual the defending team will be clogging up the\
      \ area in front of the objective. As mentioned before: a back road can be taken\
      \ where the attackers can get on the machine behind the panel and surprise the\
      \ defending team.\n\n: Once again the defending team doesn't have any pickups\
      \ to help them. Attackers can come from all sides (though bots won't jump over\
      \ the machine behind the panel). There is a Bio-Rifle in a weapon lockers though,\
      \ which can be used in setting up traps for the attacking team (like in the\
      \ elevator shafts, for example)\n\n;Destroy Computer Routers\n: The last objective\
      \ is in the same room as the previous one. This time a set of 2 Routers must\
      \ be destroyed. The Routers are very exposed and can be shot at from most of\
      \ the room. As if that isn't enough, they are also weak, making it even easier\
      \ to destroy them. 5 Flak shells destroys a Router, and destroying both Routers\
      \ finishes the round.\n\n: The best thing that the defending team can do is\
      \ trying to prevent the attackers from even reaching the room, since the Routers\
      \ are over-exposed. As mentioned before, shooting blobs form the Bio-Rifle down\
      \ the elevator shaft is a effective tactic. The best place to battle the attacking\
      \ team is on the lower level of the Router room. The rest of the route to the\
      \ attacker's spawnpoints is protected by Ceiling Sentinels, making is unsafe\
      \ for the defending team.\n\n== Weapons & Pickups ==\n\n=== Weapons ===\n* 13x\

      \ Ceiling Sentinels\n* 2x Floor Sentinels\n* 4x Turrets\n\n== Tips & tricks\
      \ ==\n;Offensive\n: One of the few advantages the defending team has is a better\
      \ weapon loadout. The weapon lockers are often located on or near the main route\
      \ to the objective, meaning that the attacking team could get these weapons\
      \ too, giving them a better chance. Since there is no ammunition around, a long\
      \ survival could result in the depletion of one's ammo. A tactical attacker/defender\
      \ will consider planning his/her death or even suicide in order to get a full\
      \ weapon loadout again (including plenty of ammo)\n\n;Defensive\n: With the\
      \ defending team having little defensive means, tactical positioning is the\
      \ key to success in this mission. The Bio-Rifle allows them to set up traps\
      \ occasionally. Other than that the defenders will have to explore the ship's\
      \ layout and discover the best points to defend the objectives from, or to plan\
      \ a surprise attack from. The more convenient spawnpoints allows the defenders\
      \ to face the attackers on their route to the objective, instead of having to\
      \ wait near the objective for the attackers to come.\n\n==Trivia==\n* AS-Jumpship\
