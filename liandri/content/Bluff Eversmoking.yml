      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Arriving from the barren <a href=\"/Velora_Pass\" title=\"Velora Pass\"\
      >Velora Pass</a> into a beautiful mountain lake monastery, the night-time atmosphere\
      \ of this planet is at its peak. There is an inexorable sense of <i>something</i>\
      \ - something that tells you that you are approaching your goal.\n</p><p>You\
      \ start in the corridor from the Velora Pass, with a door and two ornamental\
      \ pools ahead, and a lever on the right. Press the lever to open the doors,\
      \ then go out into the open space beyond.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>NOTE:</b> The water\
      \ of the ornamental pools actually has a healing power. Step into it to heal\
      \ yourself, at 10 points per second.</li></ul>\n<p><br />\nYou arrive in an\
      \ outdoor area with tall cliffs and a crucifix. Here, a Nali prays over some\
      \ dead humans from the ISV-Kran. The Nali will beckon for you to follow him;\
      \ let him run off a little way then ignore him temporarily until you're done\
      \ here. Investigate the corpses for logs [1,2].\n</p><p>One of the corpses possesses\
      \ an <a href=\"/Enforcer\" title=\"Enforcer\">Automag</a>; collect it. Then,\
      \ open barrels in this area to retrieve a box of 50 Bullets, a can of 12 Eightballs,\
      \ and a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a>.\n</p><p>Follow the\
      \ Nali now. He will lead you between two pillars on to an area where he will\
      \ operare a lever to open a large wooden door. Follow him through the door and\
      \ on to the path beyond. Follow him up the slope there between stone walls towards\
      \ another large wooden door; as you reach some windy balconies over a lake a\
      \ long way below, the Nali will veer off on to the balcony on the right - follow\
      \ him.\n</p><p>As you watch, the Nali presses a lever (which opens the large\
      \ wooden door at the top of the ramp). A <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScout</a> who was gazing out off the other\
      \ end of the balcony will make a charge for the Nali, so make sure that the\
      \ Skaarj (not the Nali) is suitably blown up. Collect the <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\"\
      \ title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a> from near the lever the\
      \ Nali operated, then go across the ramp to the other balcony, where you can\
      \ collect another Nali Healing Fruit and a barrel contains a box of 8 Rifle\
      \ Rounds.\n</p><p>Return to the slope and ascend to the door the Nali opened.\
      \ If it has closed, operate the lever to open it. Step through on to the windswept\
      \ causeway beyond.\n</p><p>Beyond the door, the sloping rock causeway leads\
      \ up to a Nali monastery on top of a tall cliff; below, a long way down, the\
      \ cliff is surrounded by water. Ascend the causeway; near the top, a rock footpath\
      \ heads down round the side of the cliff to the left. Remember it, you'll be\
      \ using it later.\nAhead are the main doors to the inner area of the monastery,\
      \ but they are locked. To the left is an arch in the monastery wall you will\
      \ use later, and to the right you can follow the top of the cliff (I'll call\
      \ it the Bluff) round the end of the monastery tower. Take this route to the\
      \ right and you will be in a small open space with the monastery wall on the\
      \ left. Here a Nali prays by a crucifix with a crucified Nali pinned to it,\
      \ while a SkaarjScout stands on guard. Kill the Skaarj before he can harm the\
      \ praying Nali.\n</p><p>Put the crucified Nali out of his misery, then collect\
      \ of the two Nali Healing Fruit near the base of the crucifix. Shoot open barrels\
      \ here for two boxes of Razor Blades. Return round to the plateau at the front\
      \ of the monastery. In doing so, you will see a crucifix on top of the outer\
      \ cliff of the canyon in the distance. Walk over to near the arch on the other\
      \ side of the monastery, then use the <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper\
      \ Rifle\">Rifle</a>'s zoom mode to zoom in on the crucifix.\n</p><p>You will\
      \ see a Nali on the cross. Dispense of him with your Rifle - shortly, there\
      \ will be a thunderclap and lightning will strike to spawn a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> on\
      \ the plateau. Collect the pack. When you're done, go through that arch you\
      \ haven't investigated yet. You will arrive in an area where two Nali pray under\
      \ the watch of two <a href=\"/Krall\" title=\"Krall\">Krall</a>. It'll be tricky,\
      \ but you can save both Nali. Do your best.\n</p><p>There is another arch in\
      \ the next wall. Go through into a small open area with empty barrels, and through\
      \ the next arch after that into a kind of covered crossroads where there is\
      \ a Krall on patrol whom you should kill. Go to the right and you will arrive\
      \ at a pool guarded by two Krall. You don't want to enter the pool yet, so go\
      \ back to the crossroads. One exit is just a wooden viewing balcony, so take\
      \ the other and veer off to the right into a small area with a hutch at the\
      \ back.\nThe hutch contains several Nali Rabbits. You can press a switch on\
      \ the hutch to open it, but they don't jump out. So, move on and go through\
      \ the arch into the next area.\n</p><p>The next area contains Nali <a href=\"\
      /Cow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cow\">Cows</a> in a pen. An exit to the\
      \ right leads you over a barred lift shaft into a small cemetary. Here, a ghost\
      \ of a Nali is praying by some gravestones. First, open barrels to the left\
      \ for two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards. There are also three Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit on the far side of the cemetary if you need them.\n</p><p>Read the gravestones\
      \ [3-9].\n</p><p>The large tomb at the far end also bears a message [10].\n\
      </p><p>Sounds tempting, but how do you get in? One of these messages was the\
      \ odd one out... the one about the rising sun. So, go over to the obelisk that\
      \ bore that message. Stand facing it, pointing in the direction by which you\
      \ entered the cemetary. Push on that face of the obelisk, and it slides open\
      \ to reveal a button beneath. Press the button. Shortly, the lid of the Vault\
      \ of the Dead slides open. Go round the back and climb the steps there to enter\
      \ the tomb.\n</p><p>The wooden floor of the tomb turns out to be lift which\
      \ descends as you enter. Look out for an alcove on the back wall of the shaft\
      \ as you descend that contains a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\"\
      >Flak Cannon</a> and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Go down to the bottom of the\
      \ shaft, and emerge into the Vault of the Dead.\n</p><p>In this vault, the ghost\
      \ of a Nali Priest summons you. Follow him and he opens the various tombs in\
      \ the vault. Visit the tombs one by one, starting with the ones at the furthest\
      \ end of the vault from where you dropped in. Each tomb can be accessed by climbing\
      \ nearby steps, and you can get out of each tomb by standing on the floors of\
      \ the tombs which are lifts that lift you back out. The first pair of tombs\
      \ at the back of the vault reveal a <a href=\"/Bio_Rifle\" title=\"Bio Rifle\"\
      >GES Biorifle</a> and an <a href=\"/Invisibility\" title=\"Invisibility\">Invisibility</a>\
      \ powerup. Coming back through the vault, the next tomb contains a Stinger and\
      \ two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards. Back at the start of the vault, the final\
      \ tomb in an offshoot from the main vault contains an <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\"\
      \ title=\"Shock Rifle\">ASMD</a> and two ASMD Cores.\n</p><p>In this offshoot\
      \ room is a small pool. Enter this pool and it turns into a series of tanks\
      \ and shafts that lead you, past a Nali corpse, up to the pool on top of the\
      \ bluff that you passed earlier. Climb out and return to the covered crossroads.\
      \ Go out on to the wooden viewing balcony, and look to the left; below is the\
      \ rock footpath down the side of the bluff that you noticed earlier, and above\
      \ that to the left at bluff level is a small rock patch outside the monastery\
      \ walls where there is a Rifle. Collect the rifle and follow the spit of land\
      \ back out to the front end of the monastery. Leave the monastery building and\
      \ go out to the plateau in front of the monastery.\n</p><p>You've exhausted\
      \ almost all possible routes of entry to the inner monastery now. There's just\
      \ one that might be the way... go on to the approach causeway and from there\
      \ locate the footpath that curves down the side of the bluff. Follow it, and\
      \ soon you will reach a point where you can look out over the lake to see the\
      \ monastery bell tower.\n</p><p>Shortcut: I am about to take a detour to help\
      \ fill the player in on what is going on in this map. If you've done this detour\
      \ in a previous play of the map, then doing it again will gain you very little.\
      \ If so, then skip this part - just stay put, and rejoin the walkthrough where\
      \ the player is back in this position (go to §).\n</p><p>Jump off the walkway\
      \ and fall down into the water of the lake below, then swim towards the bell\
      \ tower. Here, the waters are infested with some hugely resistant <a href=\"\
      /Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a> that take two Flak Shells each\
      \ to kill, so they are best avoided where possible to prevent your wasting ammo.\
      \ Anyway, climb out on to the rock around the base of the bell tower and climb\
      \ the wooden ramp to the door. The tower is locked, with a Skaarj panel nearby\
      \ [11].\n</p><p>The bell tower's a no-go zone then... but before leaving, take\
      \ time to look around. You will see some electric rails above your head going\
      \ round the bluff and up to an entrance in the outer cliff of the canyon. If\
      \ you look near the bell tower, you will see a jetty leading out from inside\
      \ the bell tower to a car on the rails docked on the jetty. You'll be using\
      \ this later, but can't get to it yet.\n</p><p>Look around from the wooden platform\
      \ outside the tower. At water level near where you dropped into the lake, a\
      \ pipe leads back into the rock. Swim over to the pipe and climb inside - mind\
      \ the <a href=\"/Tentacle\" title=\"Tentacle\">Tentacle</a> that lurks within.\
      \ Follow the pipe until it comes out near the bottom of a vertical shaft. You\
      \ can't go up the shaft, so plunge into the water below and go into the horizontal\
      \ tunnel beneath the surface.\n</p><p>Shortly you will come out in a large underground\
      \ water cave. Climb out on to the wooden platforms in the cave and kill the\
      \ three Krall on guard there. Although there are items you can collect in this\
      \ area, we'll deal with that later. For now you're just passing through. So,\
      \ go across the platform and enter the corridor in the cave wall. Inside the\
      \ corridor, an entrance on the left is blocked by electric beams. So, go to\
      \ the far end of the corridor and climb on to the lift there.\nAfter a short\
      \ ride upwards, you will be back in the cemetary on top of the bluff by means\
      \ of the previously barred lift shaft. Use your knowledge of the monastery layout\
      \ to get back to the plateau in front of the monastery, then go back down the\
      \ footpath round the side of the cliff to the point where you jumped off earlier.\n\
      </p><p>§ Continue down the sloping footpath and enter the foyer at the bottom.\
      \ Two doorways lead to corridors into the rock, take the one on the right. Going\
      \ via barrels with two Clips in an alcove on the way, go to the end of the corridor\
      \ where a Krall attacks from the top of the flight of steps down into the next\
      \ room beyond. Kill the Krall.\n</p><p>Go down the steps to enter the room.\
      \ This room is a hall with has several pillars and corner alcoves. Go down and\
      \ round to the right behind the steps to open barrels for a box of 50 Bullets.\
      \ If you then go round to the left of the stairs and into the other corner at\
      \ this end of the room, barrels here also contain a box of 50 Bullets.\n</p><p>In\
      \ this corner, shine a light into the shadow cast by the steps, so that you\
      \ are viewing the back end of the flight of steps itself. You will see an oddly\
      \ textured section of the wall; shoot it and it opens to reveal an <a href=\"\
      /Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a>\
      \ in a secret compartment. Now, cross diagonally over to the far corner of the\
      \ room and enter the raised alcove that you could see as you went down the steps.\
      \ There are two log books here [12,13].\n</p><p>If you go along the end wall\
      \ here you will pass a corridor to the right before reaching an opening at the\
      \ far end. This opening leads down to a room with some wooden plankways over\
      \ water; there is a KrallElite dozing here that you should kill.\n</p><p>When\
      \ the KrallElite is dead, go into the water and have a roam. In one corner beneath\
      \ the walkway is a can of 12 Eightballs, while a Nali Healing Fruit is perched\
      \ on top of a loose stone in the pool. There's also a drainage tunnel leading\
      \ out of the pool here but it takes you to places that don't work for this route\
      \ so ignore it.\n</p><p>Climb back up the wooden ramp out of the pool and, from\
      \ the main walkway, jump across into another water tunnel at a slightly raised\
      \ level. Kill the crucified Nali at the end then take the tunnel along to the\
      \ left where you can collect two cans of Tarydium Sludge from behind a grid\
      \ overlooking the lake. Leave the tunnel back out on to the wooden walkways,\
      \ then go back to the main underground hall. Go along the end wall and take\
      \ the corridor to the left; the corridor takes you through to a prison area\
      \ where one Krall is on guard whilst the other Krall here play dice on the floor.\
      \ Kill all the Krall (I recommend the GES Biorifle) then read the log books\
      \ on the table at the far end [14-16].\n</p><p>Take a look around the cell block.\
      \ On one side are two floors of locked prison cells, whilst on the other side\
      \ are steps to the upper level, a pool, and a lever.\n</p><p>Press the lever\
      \ - the cell doors swing open, allowing you to investigate the contents. Look\
      \ at the cells on the lower level; they are all unrewarding except for one which\
      \ contains a Nali who summons you. Follow him, and he leads you to the top level\
      \ and points in to one of the upper cells. The cell he points to has a dead\
      \ Nali with a diary and a log carved on the wall. Read them both [17,18].\n\
      </p><p>The other cells will reveal nothing but a tunnel out to the clif of the\
      \ bluff which has been newly barred off. This was presumably the Terran girl's\
      \ escape route. So, follow Kruun's example and leave the cell, entering the\
      \ water under the stairs. Kill the crucified Nali there then take the underwater\
      \ tunnel leading out of the pool at the back corner under the stairs. Follow\
      \ the tunnel and take the sloping shaft that leads off to the left, then surface\
      \ at the end into a small underground chamber.\n</p><p>This chamber contains\
      \ a number of things of interest. A tunnel at the back will reveal only Kruun's\
      \ corpse, so stay in the main room and raid the corners for three Nali Fruit\
      \ <a href=\"/Seeds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seeds\">Seeds</a> and containers\
      \ revealing a <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a>. Read\
      \ the inscription on one wall [19].\n</p><p>There are also several diaries in\
      \ this chamber [20-23]:\n</p><p>At last, a way into the inner monastery! Take\
      \ a dive back into the water from which you entered this chamber. You will see\
      \ the tunnel you came in by but also a vertical shaft down at the bottom of\
      \ which is an underwater tank with a Nali cross on the floor. Swim down into\
      \ the underwater tank, which opens out into a taller tank with a vertical shaft\
      \ in the ceiling. Swim up the shaft and surface, and at last you will be inside\
      \ the monastery.\n</p><p>Climb out of the fountain you emerged from and collect\
      \ the two Nali Healing Fruit, then go and attend to a Nali who summons you from\
      \ the next room. He will point to crates that contain a <a href=\"/Ripper\"\
      \ title=\"Ripper\">Razorjack</a>, a box of Razor Blades, and a can of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ From this room, you can either go up a flight of steps, or pass through a\
      \ doorway to open air on the far side. you might want to go out through this\
      \ doorway briefly to get your bearings, so go a little way into the outdoor\
      \ area, but beware a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner\" title=\"Skaarj\
      \ Trooper\">SkaarjGunner</a> with a <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"\
      Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a> on patrol further along such that\
      \ he sometimes comes into view and sees you.\n</p><p>Go back indoors and climb\
      \ the steps (If you want, you can jump down to the torch on the right to reveal\
      \ an <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a>\
      \ in a hidden floor compartment). At the top, you will pass through a doorway\
      \ on to a balcony above the ground floor of the monastery chapel. Here, two\
      \ Nali praying at the front will summon you from the ground floor. Follow them\
      \ and they open hidden compartments beneath the balconies, one of which contains\
      \ a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield\
      \ Belt</a>, and the other contains four ASMD Cores.\n</p><p>Leave the chapel\
      \ by following the corridor that leads off at the front end of the chapel beneath\
      \ the balconies. Follow the corridor and go out through the main chapel doors,\
      \ and you emerge in the outdoor area you were in just now. Ahead are the locked\
      \ monastery gates. To the right is the area that was being patrolled by the\
      \ SkaarjGunner. To the left, the monastery tower is accessible with a doorway.\
      \ Go to the tower and read the sign above the door (there's a Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ just beyond the chapel stairs in that direction if you need it) [24].\n</p><p>Enter\
      \ the tower and press a lever within. This calls a lift which, when you press\
      \ the lever again, will take you up to the top floor of the tower. At the top,\
      \ you will see a winch and two levers. Press the lever nearest the winch and\
      \ the winch operates, opening the main gates. Use the other lever to lower the\
      \ lift so that you can go back down again, then get off at the bottom.\n</p><p>The\
      \ main gates are of course open now but don't go through them yet. Go across\
      \ the area to the area the SkaarjGunner was patrolling; you will first arrive\
      \ in a small covered area where vases contain two Rifle Rounds. When you've\
      \ collected them, go along to the right.\n</p><p>The next area contains equipment\
      \ crates from the ISV-Kran and steps going down into an underground area. Go\
      \ first behind the crates at the far left to collect two clusters of 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards, then go down the steps and enter the corridor beyond. The corridor\
      \ leads you round to a balcony above a large underground room. A SkaarjGunner\
      \ with a Dispersion Pistol will see you from below; kill it with a quick weapon\
      \ like the ASMD, but stay on the balcony (if you fall off, there's a lift back\
      \ up). Then, take a look around the room from your position on the balcony.\n\
      </p><p>At the back corner of the room, there's an offshoot area protected by\
      \ a pair of electric beams similar to the ones blocking the corridor turning\
      \ in the underground water cave. You need to get past these beams to deactivate\
      \ them... if you look, you will see that a white balcony-level beam that separates\
      \ the offshoot from the main room continues right along to the balcony and protrudes\
      \ slightly from the wall at this end. Creep along this raised beam. At the far\
      \ end, jump across to the light fitting on the wall below. From there, shoot\
      \ the darkened wall panel between the two pillars ahead to reveal a Super Health\
      \ Pack. Collect it, and then jump down into the offshoot area. As you enter\
      \ the offshoot area you will receive a message [25].\n</p><p>There's a control\
      \ panel at the back of this area. Activate it, and the lasers disengage with\
      \ a new message [26]:\n</p><p>Leave the offshoot through the deactivated laser\
      \ field and cross the main room, going through a doorway on the other side into\
      \ a room full of hydraulic equipment where you can collect gear from the corners\
      \ including two cans of Tarydium Sludge, two ASMD Cores and an Assault Vest.\
      \ There's an information panel at the back [27].\n</p><p>You should be getting\
      \ to grips with what you have to be doing now. So, return to the main room and\
      \ use the lever at the end to operate the lift back to the balcony. Return to\
      \ the surface and go out through the main monastery gates on to the plateau\
      \ at the front of the bluff.\n</p><p>You need to get to the big underground\
      \ water cave that you saw if you took the detour earlier. This is the quickest\
      \ route I can suggest... Go to the main bluff access causeway and look down\
      \ off the cliff to the right; you'll see some wooden platforms at water level\
      \ a long way below. Don't jump down directly on to the platforms as you'll die.\
      \ Instead, follow the footpath down the side of the bluff for a bit and jump\
      \ off so that you land in the water of the lake (beware the highly resistent\
      \ Devilfish in the water), then swim to the wooden platforms and climb out.\n\
      </p><p>The wooden walkway you climb out on to goes up a slight ramp before arriving\
      \ on a slightly raised secrion where a <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\">Brute</a>\
      \ guards a Nali. Kill the Brute. From this wooden platform, you can follow a\
      \ large cave tunnel through the rock (barrels on the way contain two cans of\
      \ Tarydium Sludge and two boxes of 8 Rifle Rounds) that comes out eventually\
      \ in the large underground water cave. You are on the wrong side of the water,\
      \ so jump in and swim across, climbing out on a wooden platform on the far side.\
      \ If you haven't been here yet because you took the shortcut, kill the three\
      \ Krall in this area.\n</p><p>The place you want to be is through the corridor\
      \ that leads into the rock, but first go up the wooden ramp in this cave to\
      \ a raised platform where barrels contain 12 Eightballs. Then, you can drop\
      \ down on to a rock below the ramp to collect an Eightball Gun. Return to the\
      \ wooden platform and enter the corridor. Ahead lies the lift back to the surface,\
      \ but that's not where you want to go. Now that the Hydrolasers are deactivated,\
      \ go through the previously blocked entrance on the left.\n</p><p>The entrance\
      \ leads you to a large lift with a switch above. Step on to the raised central\
      \ section of the lift and the switch operates, and the lift slowly spirals down\
      \ the shaft coming to a rest in a pool at the bottom at the start of a long\
      \ winding underground tunnel. First things first, go down the side of the lift\
      \ and go underwater to collect of the four Nali Healing Fruit on offer there.\
      \ Climb out and enter the mouth of the corridor and collect a Rifle from a corpse\
      \ plus two extra boxes of 8 Rifle Rounds from crates nearby.\n</p><p>This long\
      \ winding tunnel is part of the Skaarj hydroelectric generator, and is thus\
      \ patrolled periodically by four SkaarjGunners with Eightball Guns. You have\
      \ to kill them all, so use stealth, the Invisibility item (if necessary), and\
      \ the Rifle to decapitate, paying visits to the Nali Healing Fruit in the pool\
      \ as required, until you are safely at the far end of the corridor.\nAt the\
      \ far end, steps spiral up round a pillar. Go round behind the pillar for two\
      \ ASMD Cores and crates containing 40 Tarydium Shards, then climb the steps\
      \ to the balcony at the top. Follow the balcony round to enter a large control\
      \ room guarded by a SkaarjGunner with a Dispersion Pistol. Kill the Skaarj then\
      \ look at the panels in the room.\n</p><p>One of the panels has a message [28].\n\
      </p><p>The second panel sends an activation signal and has another message [29].\n\
      </p><p>Go to the back of the room. By the central column here, crates contain\
      \ two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 10 Flak Shells. When you've\
      \ collected what you need, look at the back wall and you will see a conduit\
      \ leading out through the control room wall. Go along the conduit then ride\
      \ the lift at the far end that goes upwards and takes you out through a grille\
      \ that opens on to the rock around the base of the bell tower.\n</p><p>Climb\
      \ the rock up to the wooden ramps to the now open bell tower door, where the\
      \ panel has changed [30].\n</p><p>Enter the bell tower and look around. Way\
      \ up above is the bell tower loft. A short way up is a balcony with access to\
      \ the bell tower electric car jetty. In the middle, a lever-operated lift. Beneath\
      \ the grille lift, an interesting-looking hole. So, press the lever to activate\
      \ the lift but don't step on to it.\n</p><p>Below where the lift was the hole\
      \ goes down past a balcony and then on to a metal grille platform above the\
      \ control room. Jump down on to the balcony and kill the two Tentacles there\
      \ then collect of the three Nali Healing Fruit and two cans of 12 Eightballs\
      \ on the balcony. If you look down, you will see an Assault Vest on the metal\
      \ grille platform, so drop down further and grab that too.\nOn the metal grille\
      \ platform, a SkaarjGunner with a Dispersion Pistol will come running out of\
      \ a wall conduit at platform level. Kill the Skaarj then go along the conduit\
      \ yourself, collecting the <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol_Powerup\" title=\"Dispersion\
      \ Pistol Powerup\">Dispersion Pistol Powerup</a> on the way. Ride the lift at\
      \ the far end to the top, and you will come out of a grille on the other side\
      \ of the bell tower rock. Go to the right of the tower and traverse the slope\
      \ back to the side of the bell tower rock that has the entrance, then enter\
      \ the tower again.\n</p><p>Activate the lever inside to bring the lift back\
      \ down, then activate it once more and ride the lift up to the top. You will\
      \ be in the bell tower loft, so have a look around. A lever at the back controls\
      \ the lift, and there are two more switches either side. At the front, there\
      \ is a strange device with two glowing panels [31,32].\n</p><p>Before activating\
      \ the breakers, go to the back of the bell tower loft and look at a corpse by\
      \ the lift control lever.\n</p><p>It's a Terran female. Looks like Kira didn't\
      \ make it. Read her log [33].\n</p><p>When you're done, you can activate the\
      \ Static Discharge Nodes. Press the two switches on either side of the tower\
      \ loft and watch as a blue glow forms between the two Nodes. The panel on the\
      \ left will have changed [34].\n</p><p>Time to go for a ride. Use the lever\
      \ to activate the lift, then get off at the raised balcony near the bottom as\
      \ it descends. Take the doorway out on to the jetty and step aboard the shipping\
      \ car, which then starts to move - enjoy the ride.\n</p><p>After a full circle\
      \ around the bluff, you will find that the cart goes up the sloping rail to\
      \ the entrance in the canyon's outer cliff, stopping at the top. Step off and\
      \ follow the winding corridor within. At the end just before a lift, shoot barrels\
      \ open for a Flashlight. Then, step aboard the lift and press the lever to activate\
      \ it. When the lift reaches the bottom of the descending shaft, the level changes.\n\

      \ Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty\
      \ settings.''\n\nArriving from the barren [[Velora Pass]] into a beautiful mountain\
      \ lake monastery, the night-time atmosphere of this planet is at its peak. There\
      \ is an inexorable sense of ''something'' - something that tells you that you\
      \ are approaching your goal.\n\nYou start in the corridor from the Velora Pass,\
      \ with a door and two ornamental pools ahead, and a lever on the right. Press\
      \ the lever to open the doors, then go out into the open space beyond.\n\n*'''NOTE:'''\
      \ The water of the ornamental pools actually has a healing power. Step into\
      \ it to heal yourself, at 10 points per second.\n\n\nYou arrive in an outdoor\
      \ area with tall cliffs and a crucifix. Here, a Nali prays over some dead humans\
      \ from the ISV-Kran. The Nali will beckon for you to follow him; let him run\
      \ off a little way then ignore him temporarily until you're done here. Investigate\
      \ the corpses for logs [1,2].\n\nOne of the corpses possesses an [[Enforcer|Automag]];\
      \ collect it. Then, open barrels in this area to retrieve a box of 50 Bullets,\
      \ a can of 12 Eightballs, and a [[Stinger]].\n\nFollow the Nali now. He will\
      \ lead you between two pillars on to an area where he will operare a lever to\
      \ open a large wooden door. Follow him through the door and on to the path beyond.\
      \ Follow him up the slope there between stone walls towards another large wooden\
      \ door; as you reach some windy balconies over a lake a long way below, the\
      \ Nali will veer off on to the balcony on the right - follow him.\n\nAs you\
      \ watch, the Nali presses a lever (which opens the large wooden door at the\
      \ top of the ramp). A [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScout]] who was gazing\
      \ out off the other end of the balcony will make a charge for the Nali, so make\
      \ sure that the Skaarj (not the Nali) is suitably blown up. Collect the [[Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit]] from near the lever the Nali operated, then go across the\
      \ ramp to the other balcony, where you can collect another Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ and a barrel contains a box of 8 Rifle Rounds.\n\nReturn to the slope and\
      \ ascend to the door the Nali opened. If it has closed, operate the lever to\
      \ open it. Step through on to the windswept causeway beyond.\n\nBeyond the door,\
      \ the sloping rock causeway leads up to a Nali monastery on top of a tall cliff;\
      \ below, a long way down, the cliff is surrounded by water. Ascend the causeway;\
      \ near the top, a rock footpath heads down round the side of the cliff to the\
      \ left. Remember it, you'll be using it later.\nAhead are the main doors to\
      \ the inner area of the monastery, but they are locked. To the left is an arch\
      \ in the monastery wall you will use later, and to the right you can follow\
      \ the top of the cliff (I'll call it the Bluff) round the end of the monastery\
      \ tower. Take this route to the right and you will be in a small open space\
      \ with the monastery wall on the left. Here a Nali prays by a crucifix with\
      \ a crucified Nali pinned to it, while a SkaarjScout stands on guard. Kill the\
      \ Skaarj before he can harm the praying Nali.\n\nPut the crucified Nali out\
      \ of his misery, then collect of the two Nali Healing Fruit near the base of\
      \ the crucifix. Shoot open barrels here for two boxes of Razor Blades. Return\
      \ round to the plateau at the front of the monastery. In doing so, you will\
      \ see a crucifix on top of the outer cliff of the canyon in the distance. Walk\
      \ over to near the arch on the other side of the monastery, then use the [[Sniper\
      \ Rifle|Rifle]]'s zoom mode to zoom in on the crucifix.\n\nYou will see a Nali\
      \ on the cross. Dispense of him with your Rifle - shortly, there will be a thunderclap\
      \ and lightning will strike to spawn a [[Super Health Pack]] on the plateau.\
      \ Collect the pack. When you're done, go through that arch you haven't investigated\
      \ yet. You will arrive in an area where two Nali pray under the watch of two\
      \ [[Krall]]. It'll be tricky, but you can save both Nali. Do your best.\n\n\
      There is another arch in the next wall. Go through into a small open area with\
      \ empty barrels, and through the next arch after that into a kind of covered\
      \ crossroads where there is a Krall on patrol whom you should kill. Go to the\
      \ right and you will arrive at a pool guarded by two Krall. You don't want to\
      \ enter the pool yet, so go back to the crossroads. One exit is just a wooden\
      \ viewing balcony, so take the other and veer off to the right into a small\
      \ area with a hutch at the back.\nThe hutch contains several Nali Rabbits. You\
      \ can press a switch on the hutch to open it, but they don't jump out. So, move\
      \ on and go through the arch into the next area.\n\nThe next area contains Nali\
      \ [[Cow|Cows]] in a pen. An exit to the right leads you over a barred lift shaft\
      \ into a small cemetary. Here, a ghost of a Nali is praying by some gravestones.\
      \ First, open barrels to the left for two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards. There\
      \ are also three Nali Healing Fruit on the far side of the cemetary if you need\
      \ them.\n\nRead the gravestones [3-9].\n\nThe large tomb at the far end also\
      \ bears a message [10].\n\nSounds tempting, but how do you get in? One of these\
      \ messages was the odd one out... the one about the rising sun. So, go over\
      \ to the obelisk that bore that message. Stand facing it, pointing in the direction\
      \ by which you entered the cemetary. Push on that face of the obelisk, and it\
      \ slides open to reveal a button beneath. Press the button. Shortly, the lid\
      \ of the Vault of the Dead slides open. Go round the back and climb the steps\
      \ there to enter the tomb.\n\nThe wooden floor of the tomb turns out to be lift\
      \ which descends as you enter. Look out for an alcove on the back wall of the\
      \ shaft as you descend that contains a [[Flak Cannon]] and two boxes of 10 Flak\
      \ Shells. Go down to the bottom of the shaft, and emerge into the Vault of the\
      \ Dead.\n\nIn this vault, the ghost of a Nali Priest summons you. Follow him\
      \ and he opens the various tombs in the vault. Visit the tombs one by one, starting\
      \ with the ones at the furthest end of the vault from where you dropped in.\
      \ Each tomb can be accessed by climbing nearby steps, and you can get out of\
      \ each tomb by standing on the floors of the tombs which are lifts that lift\
      \ you back out. The first pair of tombs at the back of the vault reveal a [[Bio\
      \ Rifle|GES Biorifle]] and an [[Invisibility]] powerup. Coming back through\
      \ the vault, the next tomb contains a Stinger and two clusters of 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards. Back at the start of the vault, the final tomb in an offshoot from\
      \ the main vault contains an [[Shock Rifle|ASMD]] and two ASMD Cores.\n\nIn\
      \ this offshoot room is a small pool. Enter this pool and it turns into a series\
      \ of tanks and shafts that lead you, past a Nali corpse, up to the pool on top\
      \ of the bluff that you passed earlier. Climb out and return to the covered\
      \ crossroads. Go out on to the wooden viewing balcony, and look to the left;\
      \ below is the rock footpath down the side of the bluff that you noticed earlier,\
      \ and above that to the left at bluff level is a small rock patch outside the\
      \ monastery walls where there is a Rifle. Collect the rifle and follow the spit\
      \ of land back out to the front end of the monastery. Leave the monastery building\
      \ and go out to the plateau in front of the monastery.\n\nYou've exhausted almost\
      \ all possible routes of entry to the inner monastery now. There's just one\
      \ that might be the way... go on to the approach causeway and from there locate\
      \ the footpath that curves down the side of the bluff. Follow it, and soon you\
      \ will reach a point where you can look out over the lake to see the monastery\
      \ bell tower.\n\nShortcut: I am about to take a detour to help fill the player\
      \ in on what is going on in this map. If you've done this detour in a previous\
      \ play of the map, then doing it again will gain you very little. If so, then\
      \ skip this part - just stay put, and rejoin the walkthrough where the player\
      \ is back in this position (go to §).\n\nJump off the walkway and fall down\
      \ into the water of the lake below, then swim towards the bell tower. Here,\
      \ the waters are infested with some hugely resistant [[Devilfish]] that take\
      \ two Flak Shells each to kill, so they are best avoided where possible to prevent\
      \ your wasting ammo. Anyway, climb out on to the rock around the base of the\
      \ bell tower and climb the wooden ramp to the door. The tower is locked, with\
      \ a Skaarj panel nearby [11].\n\nThe bell tower's a no-go zone then... but before\
      \ leaving, take time to look around. You will see some electric rails above\
      \ your head going round the bluff and up to an entrance in the outer cliff of\
      \ the canyon. If you look near the bell tower, you will see a jetty leading\
      \ out from inside the bell tower to a car on the rails docked on the jetty.\
      \ You'll be using this later, but can't get to it yet.\n\nLook around from the\
      \ wooden platform outside the tower. At water level near where you dropped into\
      \ the lake, a pipe leads back into the rock. Swim over to the pipe and climb\
      \ inside - mind the [[Tentacle]] that lurks within. Follow the pipe until it\
      \ comes out near the bottom of a vertical shaft. You can't go up the shaft,\
      \ so plunge into the water below and go into the horizontal tunnel beneath the\
      \ surface.\n\nShortly you will come out in a large underground water cave. Climb\
      \ out on to the wooden platforms in the cave and kill the three Krall on guard\
      \ there. Although there are items you can collect in this area, we'll deal with\
      \ that later. For now you're just passing through. So, go across the platform\
      \ and enter the corridor in the cave wall. Inside the corridor, an entrance\
      \ on the left is blocked by electric beams. So, go to the far end of the corridor\
      \ and climb on to the lift there.\nAfter a short ride upwards, you will be back\
      \ in the cemetary on top of the bluff by means of the previously barred lift\
      \ shaft. Use your knowledge of the monastery layout to get back to the plateau\
      \ in front of the monastery, then go back down the footpath round the side of\
      \ the cliff to the point where you jumped off earlier.\n\n§ Continue down the\
      \ sloping footpath and enter the foyer at the bottom. Two doorways lead to corridors\
      \ into the rock, take the one on the right. Going via barrels with two Clips\
      \ in an alcove on the way, go to the end of the corridor where a Krall attacks\
      \ from the top of the flight of steps down into the next room beyond. Kill the\
      \ Krall.\n\nGo down the steps to enter the room. This room is a hall with has\
      \ several pillars and corner alcoves. Go down and round to the right behind\
      \ the steps to open barrels for a box of 50 Bullets. If you then go round to\
      \ the left of the stairs and into the other corner at this end of the room,\
      \ barrels here also contain a box of 50 Bullets.\n\nIn this corner, shine a\
      \ light into the shadow cast by the steps, so that you are viewing the back\
      \ end of the flight of steps itself. You will see an oddly textured section\
      \ of the wall; shoot it and it opens to reveal an [[Assault Vest]] in a secret\
      \ compartment. Now, cross diagonally over to the far corner of the room and\
      \ enter the raised alcove that you could see as you went down the steps. There\
      \ are two log books here [12,13].\n\nIf you go along the end wall here you will\
      \ pass a corridor to the right before reaching an opening at the far end. This\
      \ opening leads down to a room with some wooden plankways over water; there\
      \ is a KrallElite dozing here that you should kill.\n\nWhen the KrallElite is\
      \ dead, go into the water and have a roam. In one corner beneath the walkway\
      \ is a can of 12 Eightballs, while a Nali Healing Fruit is perched on top of\
      \ a loose stone in the pool. There's also a drainage tunnel leading out of the\
      \ pool here but it takes you to places that don't work for this route so ignore\
      \ it.\n\nClimb back up the wooden ramp out of the pool and, from the main walkway,\
      \ jump across into another water tunnel at a slightly raised level. Kill the\
      \ crucified Nali at the end then take the tunnel along to the left where you\
      \ can collect two cans of Tarydium Sludge from behind a grid overlooking the\
      \ lake. Leave the tunnel back out on to the wooden walkways, then go back to\
      \ the main underground hall. Go along the end wall and take the corridor to\
      \ the left; the corridor takes you through to a prison area where one Krall\
      \ is on guard whilst the other Krall here play dice on the floor. Kill all the\
      \ Krall (I recommend the GES Biorifle) then read the log books on the table\
      \ at the far end [14-16].\n\nTake a look around the cell block. On one side\
      \ are two floors of locked prison cells, whilst on the other side are steps\
      \ to the upper level, a pool, and a lever.\n\nPress the lever - the cell doors\
      \ swing open, allowing you to investigate the contents. Look at the cells on\
      \ the lower level; they are all unrewarding except for one which contains a\
      \ Nali who summons you. Follow him, and he leads you to the top level and points\
      \ in to one of the upper cells. The cell he points to has a dead Nali with a\
      \ diary and a log carved on the wall. Read them both [17,18].\n\nThe other cells\
      \ will reveal nothing but a tunnel out to the clif of the bluff which has been\
      \ newly barred off. This was presumably the Terran girl's escape route. So,\
      \ follow Kruun's example and leave the cell, entering the water under the stairs.\
      \ Kill the crucified Nali there then take the underwater tunnel leading out\
      \ of the pool at the back corner under the stairs. Follow the tunnel and take\
      \ the sloping shaft that leads off to the left, then surface at the end into\
      \ a small underground chamber.\n\nThis chamber contains a number of things of\
      \ interest. A tunnel at the back will reveal only Kruun's corpse, so stay in\
      \ the main room and raid the corners for three Nali Fruit [[Seeds]] and containers\
      \ revealing a [[Flashlight]]. Read the inscription on one wall [19].\n\nThere\
      \ are also several diaries in this chamber [20-23]:\n\nAt last, a way into the\
      \ inner monastery! Take a dive back into the water from which you entered this\
      \ chamber. You will see the tunnel you came in by but also a vertical shaft\
      \ down at the bottom of which is an underwater tank with a Nali cross on the\
      \ floor. Swim down into the underwater tank, which opens out into a taller tank\
      \ with a vertical shaft in the ceiling. Swim up the shaft and surface, and at\
      \ last you will be inside the monastery.\n\nClimb out of the fountain you emerged\
      \ from and collect the two Nali Healing Fruit, then go and attend to a Nali\
      \ who summons you from the next room. He will point to crates that contain a\
      \ [[Ripper|Razorjack]], a box of Razor Blades, and a can of 12 Eightballs. From\
      \ this room, you can either go up a flight of steps, or pass through a doorway\
      \ to open air on the far side. you might want to go out through this doorway\
      \ briefly to get your bearings, so go a little way into the outdoor area, but\
      \ beware a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner|SkaarjGunner]] with a [[Dispersion\
      \ Pistol]] on patrol further along such that he sometimes comes into view and\
      \ sees you.\n\nGo back indoors and climb the steps (If you want, you can jump\
      \ down to the torch on the right to reveal an [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Gun]]\
      \ in a hidden floor compartment). At the top, you will pass through a doorway\
      \ on to a balcony above the ground floor of the monastery chapel. Here, two\
      \ Nali praying at the front will summon you from the ground floor. Follow them\
      \ and they open hidden compartments beneath the balconies, one of which contains\
      \ a [[Shield Belt]], and the other contains four ASMD Cores.\n\nLeave the chapel\
      \ by following the corridor that leads off at the front end of the chapel beneath\
      \ the balconies. Follow the corridor and go out through the main chapel doors,\
      \ and you emerge in the outdoor area you were in just now. Ahead are the locked\
      \ monastery gates. To the right is the area that was being patrolled by the\
      \ SkaarjGunner. To the left, the monastery tower is accessible with a doorway.\
      \ Go to the tower and read the sign above the door (there's a Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ just beyond the chapel stairs in that direction if you need it) [24].\n\n\
      Enter the tower and press a lever within. This calls a lift which, when you\
      \ press the lever again, will take you up to the top floor of the tower. At\
      \ the top, you will see a winch and two levers. Press the lever nearest the\
      \ winch and the winch operates, opening the main gates. Use the other lever\
      \ to lower the lift so that you can go back down again, then get off at the\
      \ bottom.\n\nThe main gates are of course open now but don't go through them\
      \ yet. Go across the area to the area the SkaarjGunner was patrolling; you will\
      \ first arrive in a small covered area where vases contain two Rifle Rounds.\
      \ When you've collected them, go along to the right.\n\nThe next area contains\
      \ equipment crates from the ISV-Kran and steps going down into an underground\
      \ area. Go first behind the crates at the far left to collect two clusters of\
      \ 40 Tarydium Shards, then go down the steps and enter the corridor beyond.\
      \ The corridor leads you round to a balcony above a large underground room.\
      \ A SkaarjGunner with a Dispersion Pistol will see you from below; kill it with\
      \ a quick weapon like the ASMD, but stay on the balcony (if you fall off, there's\
      \ a lift back up). Then, take a look around the room from your position on the\
      \ balcony.\n\nAt the back corner of the room, there's an offshoot area protected\
      \ by a pair of electric beams similar to the ones blocking the corridor turning\
      \ in the underground water cave. You need to get past these beams to deactivate\
      \ them... if you look, you will see that a white balcony-level beam that separates\
      \ the offshoot from the main room continues right along to the balcony and protrudes\
      \ slightly from the wall at this end. Creep along this raised beam. At the far\
      \ end, jump across to the light fitting on the wall below. From there, shoot\
      \ the darkened wall panel between the two pillars ahead to reveal a Super Health\
      \ Pack. Collect it, and then jump down into the offshoot area. As you enter\
      \ the offshoot area you will receive a message [25].\n\nThere's a control panel\
      \ at the back of this area. Activate it, and the lasers disengage with a new\
      \ message [26]:\n\nLeave the offshoot through the deactivated laser field and\
      \ cross the main room, going through a doorway on the other side into a room\
      \ full of hydraulic equipment where you can collect gear from the corners including\
      \ two cans of Tarydium Sludge, two ASMD Cores and an Assault Vest. There's an\
      \ information panel at the back [27].\n\nYou should be getting to grips with\
      \ what you have to be doing now. So, return to the main room and use the lever\
      \ at the end to operate the lift back to the balcony. Return to the surface\
      \ and go out through the main monastery gates on to the plateau at the front\
      \ of the bluff.\n\nYou need to get to the big underground water cave that you\
      \ saw if you took the detour earlier. This is the quickest route I can suggest...\
      \ Go to the main bluff access causeway and look down off the cliff to the right;\
      \ you'll see some wooden platforms at water level a long way below. Don't jump\
      \ down directly on to the platforms as you'll die. Instead, follow the footpath\
      \ down the side of the bluff for a bit and jump off so that you land in the\
      \ water of the lake (beware the highly resistent Devilfish in the water), then\
      \ swim to the wooden platforms and climb out.\n\nThe wooden walkway you climb\
      \ out on to goes up a slight ramp before arriving on a slightly raised secrion\
      \ where a [[Brute]] guards a Nali. Kill the Brute. From this wooden platform,\
      \ you can follow a large cave tunnel through the rock (barrels on the way contain\
      \ two cans of Tarydium Sludge and two boxes of 8 Rifle Rounds) that comes out\
      \ eventually in the large underground water cave. You are on the wrong side\
      \ of the water, so jump in and swim across, climbing out on a wooden platform\
      \ on the far side. If you haven't been here yet because you took the shortcut,\
      \ kill the three Krall in this area.\n\nThe place you want to be is through\
      \ the corridor that leads into the rock, but first go up the wooden ramp in\
      \ this cave to a raised platform where barrels contain 12 Eightballs. Then,\
      \ you can drop down on to a rock below the ramp to collect an Eightball Gun.\
      \ Return to the wooden platform and enter the corridor. Ahead lies the lift\
      \ back to the surface, but that's not where you want to go. Now that the Hydrolasers\
      \ are deactivated, go through the previously blocked entrance on the left.\n\
      \nThe entrance leads you to a large lift with a switch above. Step on to the\
      \ raised central section of the lift and the switch operates, and the lift slowly\
      \ spirals down the shaft coming to a rest in a pool at the bottom at the start\
      \ of a long winding underground tunnel. First things first, go down the side\
      \ of the lift and go underwater to collect of the four Nali Healing Fruit on\
      \ offer there. Climb out and enter the mouth of the corridor and collect a Rifle\
      \ from a corpse plus two extra boxes of 8 Rifle Rounds from crates nearby.\n\
      \nThis long winding tunnel is part of the Skaarj hydroelectric generator, and\
      \ is thus patrolled periodically by four SkaarjGunners with Eightball Guns.\
      \ You have to kill them all, so use stealth, the Invisibility item (if necessary),\
      \ and the Rifle to decapitate, paying visits to the Nali Healing Fruit in the\
      \ pool as required, until you are safely at the far end of the corridor.\nAt\
      \ the far end, steps spiral up round a pillar. Go round behind the pillar for\
      \ two ASMD Cores and crates containing 40 Tarydium Shards, then climb the steps\
      \ to the balcony at the top. Follow the balcony round to enter a large control\
      \ room guarded by a SkaarjGunner with a Dispersion Pistol. Kill the Skaarj then\
      \ look at the panels in the room.\n\nOne of the panels has a message [28].\n\
      \nThe second panel sends an activation signal and has another message [29].\n\
      \nGo to the back of the room. By the central column here, crates contain two\
      \ clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 10 Flak Shells. When you've collected\
      \ what you need, look at the back wall and you will see a conduit leading out\
      \ through the control room wall. Go along the conduit then ride the lift at\
      \ the far end that goes upwards and takes you out through a grille that opens\
      \ on to the rock around the base of the bell tower.\n\nClimb the rock up to\
      \ the wooden ramps to the now open bell tower door, where the panel has changed\
      \ [30].\n\nEnter the bell tower and look around. Way up above is the bell tower\
      \ loft. A short way up is a balcony with access to the bell tower electric car\
      \ jetty. In the middle, a lever-operated lift. Beneath the grille lift, an interesting-looking\
      \ hole. So, press the lever to activate the lift but don't step on to it.\n\n\
      Below where the lift was the hole goes down past a balcony and then on to a\
      \ metal grille platform above the control room. Jump down on to the balcony\
      \ and kill the two Tentacles there then collect of the three Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ and two cans of 12 Eightballs on the balcony. If you look down, you will see\
      \ an Assault Vest on the metal grille platform, so drop down further and grab\
      \ that too.\nOn the metal grille platform, a SkaarjGunner with a Dispersion\
      \ Pistol will come running out of a wall conduit at platform level. Kill the\
      \ Skaarj then go along the conduit yourself, collecting the [[Dispersion Pistol\
      \ Powerup]] on the way. Ride the lift at the far end to the top, and you will\
      \ come out of a grille on the other side of the bell tower rock. Go to the right\
      \ of the tower and traverse the slope back to the side of the bell tower rock\
      \ that has the entrance, then enter the tower again.\n\nActivate the lever inside\
      \ to bring the lift back down, then activate it once more and ride the lift\
      \ up to the top. You will be in the bell tower loft, so have a look around.\
      \ A lever at the back controls the lift, and there are two more switches either\
      \ side. At the front, there is a strange device with two glowing panels [31,32].\n\
      \nBefore activating the breakers, go to the back of the bell tower loft and\
      \ look at a corpse by the lift control lever.\n\nIt's a Terran female. Looks\
      \ like Kira didn't make it. Read her log [33].\n\nWhen you're done, you can\
      \ activate the Static Discharge Nodes. Press the two switches on either side\
      \ of the tower loft and watch as a blue glow forms between the two Nodes. The\
      \ panel on the left will have changed [34].\n\nTime to go for a ride. Use the\
      \ lever to activate the lift, then get off at the raised balcony near the bottom\
      \ as it descends. Take the doorway out on to the jetty and step aboard the shipping\
      \ car, which then starts to move - enjoy the ride.\n\nAfter a full circle around\
      \ the bluff, you will find that the cart goes up the sloping rail to the entrance\
      \ in the canyon's outer cliff, stopping at the top. Step off and follow the\
      \ winding corridor within. At the end just before a lift, shoot barrels open\
      \ for a Flashlight. Then, step aboard the lift and press the lever to activate\
      \ it. When the lift reaches the bottom of the descending shaft, the level changes.\n\
