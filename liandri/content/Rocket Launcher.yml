      You got 10 rockets\". It is believed that the most precise name for it would\
      \ simply be \"<b>Rocket Pack</b>\". As the Rocket Launcher of Return to Na Pali\

      \ it takes even 10 Rocket Packs to fill the Rocket Launcher with ammo. As the\

    text: "The '''Rocket Launcher''' (often abbreviated as '''RL''') is a weapon that\

      The Eightball Launcher uses '''cans of 12 Eightballs''' for ammunition. When\
      \ you get close to a can, its lid opens and five bars land on the base. After\
      \ that, the lid floats down and rests on the ring of bars. As one can provides\
      \ 12 Eightballs, it's a valuable pickup. It's a common item in the single player\
      \ campaigns. There are usually cans of Eightballs before and after a boss fight,\
      \ especially against a [[Titan]]. In the multiplayer map [[DmMorbias]], Eightball\
      \ cans are the only ammunition available. \n{{clear}}\n\n==Unreal: RTNP==\n\

      \ They appear to be light-weight as the total ammo capacity of the Rocket Launcher\
      \ is 100, so it takes even 10 Rocket Packs to fill the Rocket Launcher with\

      \ in medium range as it has a very big splash damage radius but is somewhat\
      \ slow and easy to avoid at long ranges. The Shark is a favourite weapon of\
      \ the Heavy human class in Unreal II.\n\n[[Image:Shark-u2.jpg|right|thumb|The\

      \ enemy like a heavy-armored troop, if you're pretty sure you can hit him with\
      \ the first trigger, then use it so you can pump out ammo as quickly as possible.\
      \ Locking on becomes more useful at longer ranges, especially as multiple weaker\
      \ enemies advance on you. In Unreal II your character wears a heavy suit of\
      \ power armor, so rocket jumping is not possible.\n\n=== Ammunition ===\n[[Image:SharkAmmo.png|right|200px|thumb|Rocket\
      \ Packs of Unreal II]]\nThe ammo for the Shark, Rocket Launcher of [[Unreal\
      \ II]], is called a ''Rocket Pack'' as well. They only contain 5 rockets, up\
      \ to 40 maximum. Rocket Packs are very rare in the game and the main supply\
      \ for rockets are Sharks, either dropped by enemies or as pickups. So the Rocket\
      \ Packs are very useful, as rockets deal loads of damage and quite quickly use\
      \ up ammo. You need 8 Rocket Packs to get the full backpack of rockets. The\
      \ Rocket Pack looks like a holder for three rockets (two are behind the first\
      \ three and not shown), each of which have 4 warheads.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Unreal\

      \n;Primary Fire\n: Slow moving but deadly rockets are aimed at opponents. Trigger\
      \ can be held down to load up to six rockets at a time, which can be fired at\
      \ once. Multiple rockets are fire in a flat, horizontal spread unless the secondary\
      \ fire button is pressed while they are loading. This will cause them to fire\
      \ in a tight spiral formation.\n\n;Secondary Fire\n: Grenades are lobbed from\
      \ the barrel. Secondary trigger can be held as well for up to six grenades.\
      \ If the primary fire button is pressed while the grenades are loading, they\
      \ will be fired in a tight cluster instead of spread out.\n\n;Tactics\n: Keeping\
      \ this weapon pointed at an opponent will cause it to lock on, and while the\
      \ gun is locked the next rocket fired will be a homing rocket. Because the Rocket\
      \ Launcher can load up multiple rockets, it fires when you release the fire\
      \ button. If you prefer, it can be configured to fire a rocket as soon as you\
      \ press the fire button down, at the expense of the multiple rocket load-up\
      \ feature. This is set in the Input Options menu.\n\n=== Ammunition ===\n[[Image:RocketPUT.png|right|75px|thumb|A\

      \ uses ''Rocket Packs'' almost the same way cans of Eightballs are used in Unreal.\
      \ Rocket Packs, however, no longer animate and are slimmer. They are a little\
      \ more valuable, as rockets of Unreal Tournament deal somewhat more damage than\

      The Rocket Launcher's rockets fly straight, do a lot of damage in a direct hit,\
      \ and have a fair-sized splash damage radius.  (Because of the splash damage,\
      \ Rocket Launchers are less than ideal for close-range fighting and are notorious\
      \ for causing suicides in this situation.)\n\nSince Rocket Launchers are the\
      \ most powerful standard weapon except a sniper and they have a reasonably fast\
      \ reload rate and a large splash damage radius (hence the RL is called a \"\
      spammy\" weapon), they are a favorite of new players.  Because it's much more\
      \ rarely used by advanced players, the Rocket Launcher is often found opposite\
      \ the Flak Cannon in [[Capture the Flag]], [[Double Domination]], and [[Bombing\
      \ Run]] maps, and in either wide-open or very tight places in [[Deathmatch]]\
      \ or [[Domination]].  The theory behind the latter locations is that a weapon\
      \ is most balanced if it is placed in a location where it is least useful; since\
      \ the RL is usually considered a mid-range weapon, these locations make sense.\n\
      \n===Use in [[Onslaught]]===\n*Rockets have a lot of momentum, so they will\
      \ temporarily stop or slow down [[Scorpion]]s and usually change their direction\
      \ slightly, disorienting the driver.  Three rockets kills a scorpion.\n*Since\
      \ Rocket Launchers are the second-most-powerful weapon against vehicles (factoring\
      \ in their rate of fire) they are the most useful weapon to combat [[Goliath]]\
      \ tanks and other large, slow vehicles (not including the [[Hellbender]] unless\
      \ it's coming straight at you) after [[AVRiL]]s.  However, [[Manta]]s and [[Raptor]]s\
      \ are usually too agile to be hit by rockets.\n*Because rockets fly very straight\
      \ and cannot be shot down, they are ideal for shooting Power Nodes from a distance.\
      \  A useful tactic if you're bad at aiming is to line up using the [[Lightning\
      \ Gun]] or [[Sniper Rifle]] and then switch to the RL without moving.\n\n===Use\
      \ in [[Deathmatch]] and other [[Gametype]]s===\n*Loading up on rockets before\
      \ bursting in to an area where you know there are enemy players allows you to\
      \ unleash a powerful attack on multiple enemies before they know what's going\
      \ on.\n*Players in the damage radius of a Rocket are lifted off the floor, preventing\
      \ them from jumping or dodging.  Good players can predict the landing spot and\
      \ send another rocket there to greet the enemy.  This ability can also be used\
      \ to boost players themselves, although the [[Impact Hammer]] (in UT) and [[Shield\
      \ Gun]] (in UT2003/4) usually take this role. Rocket Jumps don't work in Unreal\
      \ II because of the heavy armor worn.\n*Hitting the ground near a player's feet\
      \ is easier than hitting a player because it's a larger target and doesn't move.\
      \  Often the splash damage is plenty to hurt the enemy.  Jumping in the air\
      \ gives an easier angle from which to aim at a player's feet.\n\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n\
