      \n'''Avalon''' is the first map of [[Unreal 2: The Awakening]] single player.\
      \ It is a set of tutorial levels. The file names of these maps are TutA.un2\
      \ and TutB.un2. There will be only one real opponent to fight in this set of\
      \ levels. The B section of the tutorial can be skipped. Before starting the\
      \ game, you are allowed to choose the difficulty setting. It will affect the\
      \ weapon fire and defence of your opponents, but nothing else. When the level\
      \ is loaded, a cutscene is shown.\n\n==Cutscene==\n[[Image:Intro1.png|right|thumb|200px|The\
      \ first cutscene view]]\nThe first cutscene displays the Odyssey IV planet and\
      \ [[TCA Atlantis]] floating in space near the panet. The ship flies past the\
      \ camera, and the following logo is displayed:\n\n{{quote|Unreal 2: The Awakening|The\
      \ first words of the single player campaign}}\n\nSoon after the logo fades out,\
      \ the docking bay doors of TCA Atlantis opens and a dropship flies out of the\
      \ main ship. The main engines start, and the dropship flies down to the earth-like\
      \ surface of Odyssey IV (the [[Terran Colonial Authority]] headquarters appear\
      \ to be in a place that looks very familiar to [[Earth]]'s Turkey). The cutscene\
      \ ends, a new map is loaded, and another cutscene starts.\n\nThis cutscene now\
      \ allows you to pause the game. The action now takes place on the surface of\
      \ Odyssey IV. The camera is first centered on one of the oceans of the planet.\
      \ The dropship seen earlier appears from the sky and flies towards the mainland.\
      \ The camera follows the ship, and the following information appears on the\
      \ screen:\n\n{{quote|Oddysey IV, Terran Colonial HQ|Place description}}\n\n\
      [[Image:Intro2.png|right|thumb|200px|The dialog between [[Sector Commander Hawkins]]\
      \ and [[John Dalton]]]]\nThe camera now centers on one of the towers of the\
      \ building the dropship was flying to. [[Sector Commander Hawkins]] can be seen\
      \ working on the other side of the window. Seconds later, [[John Dalton]] walks\
      \ in the room. A dialog starts.\n{{quote|Dalton: Commander Hawkins! Sir!<br/>\n\
      Hawkins: Good to see you, Dalton. I'll get right to the point. Your request\
      \ for reinstatement in the [[marines]] has been denied... again. I know you're\
      \ disappointed, but we can try again in six months.<br/>\nDalton: Can't I buck\
      \ it up the line?<br/>\nHawkins: I've spoken with General [[Drexler]] personally...\
      \ It was no-go.<br/>\nDalton: Damn.<br/>\nHawkins: When you return to your ship,\
      \ you'll have a new pilot. He's a [[Hex-Core]] alien named [[Ne'Ban]]. We got\
      \ him in an officer exchange program. He's some kind of muckety-muck on his\
      \ home planet and the brass want him kept away out of harm's way. You've got\
      \ the quietest patrol, so you're it.<br/>\nDalton: I'm getting mighty tired\
      \ of babysitting the ass-end of nowhere!<br/>\nHawkins: The [[Terran Colonial\
      \ Authority|Colonial Authority]] isn't so bad, John. We don't see as much action\
      \ as the Marines, but our tradition of service is just as strong.<br/>\nDalton:\
      \ Save it for the recruits, Sir! I know the score.<br/>\nHawkins: Stow it, Dalton.\
      \ We've got a new refresher course set up in the basement. Either give it a\
      \ run or get back to your ship. Dismissed.|The first dialogue}}\n\nThe dialogue\
      \ ends here, and you get the control of John Dalton. From here, you get the\
      \ ability to save the game.\n\n==Terran Colonial Authority HQ==\n\n[[Image:AvalonPre1.png|right|thumb|200px|The\
      \ campaign starts here]]\nSector Commander Hawkins asks you a question:\n\n\
      {{quoteSource|Do you want to take the training run or get back to your ship?|Sector\
      \ Commander Hawkins|Sector Commander Hawkins}}\n\nYou now have two options of\
      \ sentences to say: ''1 - Tutorial'' or ''2 - Return to ship''. It is suggested\
      \ that you answer to take the tutorial or you will skip a training level. You\
      \ answer:\n{{QuoteSource|(1) I could use a refresher.<br/>\n(2) I should be\
      \ getting back.|John Dalton|John Dalton}}\nCommander Hawkins say:\n{{quoteSource|(1)\
      \ All right. Dismissed. <br/>\n(2) Safe journey, John.|Sector Commander Hawkins|Sector\
      \ Commander Hawkins}}\n\nEither way, you will get the following message two\
      \ times:\n{{quote|F4 - New Objective|HUD}}\nIf you open your objective log,\
      \ you will see that you have these objectives:\n{{quote|[Incomplete] Go to the\
      \ elevator<br/>\n(1) [Incomplete] Run through the TCA training program<br/>\n\
      (2) [Incomplete] Return to the ship|Objective log}}\n\nClose the log and look\
      \ around. You are in the tower of the TCA headquarters, with 3 more creatures\
      \ in the room. One of them is Sector Commander Hawkins you just talked to. If\
      \ you talk to him again, he just drops the same line you would get if you answered\
      \ to go to the ship to his first question. Another human here is a [[Marines|Heavy\
      \ marine]]. If you talk to him, he will salute you and say:\n{{quote|Glad you\
      \ could drop by, Marshal.|Marine}}\nThe last creature here is a technician [[Kai]].\
      \ If you try to talk to it, you will only hear some hissing, probably in Kai\
      \ language. You can take a look at the middle screen in the control room. It\
      \ is displaying the Planetary Cannon that protects Odyssey IV from enemy attacks.\n\
      \n[[Image:AvalonPre2.png|right|thumb|200px|The view of Avalon from the control\
      \ tower]]\nYou have no other way to take than through the door you saw yourself\
      \ coming in in the first place. Walk through and down the stairs, where you\
      \ will meet two more marines, this time light, patroling the area. You can look\
      \ around the area. You will see that you are on an open platform with a good\
      \ view of the surface. If you went to the back of the platform, you would see\
      \ the Planetary Cannon you saw a few moments ago on the screen, as well as your\
      \ own dropship. You might consider throughly looking at the landscape while\
      \ you're here so you would be prepared when you get back to Avalon after your\
      \ journeys. After you're done admiring the view, go down the stairs and try\
      \ not to fall off as it means a certain death. You will soon reach another light\
      \ marine equipped with a [[Combat Assault Rifle]] and the elevator. Walk in\
      \ and you will get the following message:\n{{quote|F4 - Objective Complete|HUD}}\n\
      Now press the button inside the elevator to activate it. You are taken down,\
      \ and seconds later another level loads. If you chose to take the tutorial,\
      \ read on. If not, go to the [[Sanctuary|second level]].\n\n==Terran Colonial\
      \ Authority HQ, Tutorial==\n[[Image:U2Tutorial1.png|right|thumb|200px|The training\
      \ center's control room]]\nYou start the level in the elevator. It is still\
      \ going down. A few seconds later, it stops and the door opens. Walk through\
      \ to a corridor with doors to the left. There is nothing interesting up ahead\
      \ than a few crates that you can mantle on, and a few windows to see the area\
      \ you are going to. Go through the door, and [[Raff]] will greet you:\n{{quoteSource|How\
      \ ya doin', Marshal? I heard you'd be here. Let me reboot the system.|Raff|Raff}}\n\
      Raff will enter something to the terminal on his desk and start the tutorial.\n\
      {{quoteSource|Name's Raff. I'll take you through the program. All set, go on\
      \ in.|Raff|Raff}}\nWhile talking, Raff will open the door behind the desk for\
      \ you. Walk in. In the cage in the otherwise empty room a hologram of Raff will\
      \ appear.\n{{quoteSource|Hello again, and welcome to the Avalon training center.\
      \ The course is lined with holo-projectors, so I'll be with you all the way.\
      \ Now ait a second, while I take a scan.|Raff|Raff}}\nA scanner at the top will\
      \ be activated and will do a scan of your inventory. You will be surprised with\
      \ one of those in a level later on. After the scan is done, Raff will continue\
      \ talking.\n{{quoteSource|Sensors indicate you're wearing XA/F power armor.\
      \ Let me dig up those specs. Ah, here they are.|Raff|Raff}}\n[[Image:U2Tutorial2.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Raff]]\
      \ with XA/F armor on]]\nNow Raff's hologram will change to something that looks\
      \ like you, but acts like Raff. He will continue speaking.\n{{quoteSource|Not\
      \ bad. The XA/F series isn't the toughest battle armor available, but it's pretty\
      \ damn versatile. Underwater capable. Rechargeable shields. Plasma Heads-Up-Display.\
      \ Score one for the good old Terran Colonial Authority. Let's take a look at\
      \ your HUD. Health and shield indicators are in the upper left. Ammo indicators\
      \ are upper right. The top counts down your current clip. Underneath is the\
      \ amount you have in reserve. Available weapons show up down the right. Your\
      \ suit also scans for important objects, like switches and panels - even people.\
      \ Come over and look at me to activate the use reticle, then hit your \"use\"\
      \ control.|Raff|Raff}}\nDo as Raff said you to do. A small message will appear,\
      \ telling you your current use key. Raff will continue talking.\n{{quoteSource|Using\
      \ someone will get their attention so you can talk to them. Sometimes your suit\
      \ will give you numbered options of things to say. Go ahead, pick a number.|Raff|Raff}}\n\
      You will get a list of options to say, just like when talking to [[Sector Commander\
      \ Hawkins]]: ''1 - Uh, can you hear me?'', ''2 - Let's get a move on.'' and\
      \ ''3 - Why am I talking to a hologram?'' Pick any number, it doesn't matter\
      \ which. You will say:\n{{quoteSource|(1) Uh, can you hear me?<br/>\n(2) How\
      \ 'bout we pick up the pace, and get to the weapons?<br/>\n(3) Why am I talking\
      \ to a hologram?|John Dalton|John Dalton}}\nYou will get an answer:\n{{quoteSource|(1)\
      \ Loud and clear. Let's move on.<br/>\n(2) Soon! Let's move on.<br/>\n(3) Who\
      \ knows? My mother talks to her cat. Let's keep moving.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext up\
      \ is agility training. Go use the button next to the exit.|Raff|Raff}}\nRaff's\
      \ hologram will disappear. You can see three doors in this room - one set of\
      \ doors leads back to the control room, the second one is the ones you need\
      \ to open, and you will use the third ones to get back after you passed the\
      \ training. Use the small blue keypad on the wall to open the door and go in.\
      \ You will receive a radio transmission.\n[[Image:U2Tutorial3.png|right|thumb|200px|The\
      \ agility obstacle course]]\n{{quoteSource|While you're on the obstacle course,\
      \ you'll hear me through your suit's radio. It's a good unit with excellent\
      \ range that even extends off-planet, if the signal's strong enough. Stand by\
      \ while I configure the course for your suit. Let's start with something simple.\
      \ Jump over these blocks.|Raff|Raff}}\nYou will get another message displaying\
      \ your jump key. Jump over the blocks.\n{{quoteSource|Not bad. But not every\
      \ jump is so easy. If you jump straight up, and don't stop, you'll drag yourself\
      \ onto that ledge. It's called mantling. Give it a try.|Raff|Raff}}\nSimply\
      \ stand next to the block and jump up. You will hear Raff again.\n{{quoteSource|All\
      \ right, now crouch down and crawl under these blocks. Don't worry. I won't\
      \ let 'em drop any further.|Raff|Raff}}\nAnother message displays your crouch\
      \ button. But before crouching, look around. You'll see that there's an open\
      \ area to the right of where you are standing. Go there and notice that one\
      \ box is near a set of windows you could use to go in a fenced area. Jump on\
      \ the crate, then mantle jump on the windows, walk in the fenced area and look\
      \ inside a crate. You will see a some kind of a head in an open box, jump into\
      \ it and take the head. You now unlocked a secret weapon course! Jump back through\
      \ the fence or the window and continue. Crouch through the obstacle.\n{{quoteSource|Great.\
      \ Go through that door. Time for the good stuff: weapons.|Raff|Raff}}\nUse a\
      \ blue keypad again and the big doors will open. Raff apears at another cage,\
      \ but this time the cage open and Raff's hologram steps out. He says:\n{{quoteSource|Let's\
      \ start with every rookie's first gun: the [[Dispersion Pistol]]. Go ahead,\
      \ grab it.|Raff|Raff}}\n[[Image:U2Tutorial4.png|right|thumb|200px|The [[Dispersion\
      \ Pistol]] and the [[Krall]]]]\nNow a panel containing a [[Dispersion Pistol]]\
      \ opens, allowing you to take your first gun. As soon as you take it, the wall\
      \ in front of you moves, revealing two 2D models of [[Krall]], enemies seen\
      \ in [[Unreal]]. Raff explains:\n{{quoteSource|Not a very realistic target.\
      \ Sorry, it's been an epic wait for the tech upgrade. Take a couple practise\
      \ shots.|Raff|Raff}}\nIn this statement you might find a link with the release\
      \ time of Unreal 2: it was a long time between the announce of Unreal 2 to the\
      \ actual release, and the creators are [[Epic Games]].\n\nYou might want to\
      \ jump over the low fence and look around the empty area there. If you get close\
      \ to the Krall, some kind of a force stops you from moving further. This collision\
      \ hull is quite strange - if you keep going forward while looking upwards, you'll\
      \ eventually reach the top, and then fall down. Notice that there are four more\
      \ walls, all of which have these collision hulls.\n\nShoot at a Krall with your\
      \ primary fire. A green light above their heads will light up, and Raff will\
      \ say:\n{{quoteSource|The dispersion pistol doesn't pack a whole lot of punch,\
      \ but it's always there for you because it never runs out of ammo. Give the\
      \ alternative fire a try. It builds up a charge and then releases a bigger blast.|Raff|Raff}}\n\
      Use the alternative fire. Raff now says:\n[[Image:U2Tutorial5.png|right|thumb|200px|The\
      \ [[Combat Assault Rifle]] and the [[Brute]]s]]\n{{quoteSource|He never knew\
      \ what hit him. Enough of the popgun, let's take a look at a real weapon. The\
      \ [[Combat Assault Rifle]] is a Marshal's best friend. Load it up with ammo\
      \ and mow down this dangerous desperado.|Raff|Raff}}\nThe same scene occurs,\
      \ only now you get the [[Combat Assault Rifle]]. Near the fence you can snag\
      \ an Assault Rifle clip which respawns - the only respawning piece of ammo you\
      \ will see in the single player mission. Shoot at the model of a [[Brute]] with\
      \ the primary fire. You will see that your Dispersion Pistol doesn't work here.\
      \ Raff now says:\n{{quoteSource|The CAR's primary fire mode is fully automatic,\
      \ and it goes through rounds of uranium shards like candy. While you're firing,\
      \ watch the upper right of your HUD to see the ammo drain from the current clip.\
      \ Always try to find a quiet moment to reload before combat. Otherwise you may\
      \ find yourself caught having to reload in the middle of a firefight. The CAR's\
      \ alt-fire is a concentrated bolt of five shards that breaks upon impact, and\
      \ will even bounce off walls. See if you can ricochet a bolt against the wall\
      \ and hit the target.|Raff|Raff}}\nDo as Raff said, and he will say:\n[[Image:U2Tutorial6.png|right|thumb|200px|The\
      \ [[Grenade Launcher]] and the [[Pack Hunter]]s, close up]]\n{{quoteSource|You\
      \ catch on quick. This next weapon isn't standard issue, but what the hell,\
      \ sometimes ya just gotta have fun. No weapon is more versatile and dangerous\
      \ than the [[Grenade Launcher]]. It holds up to six different types of ammo,\
      \ and each has radically different uses. The standard is your basic fragmentation\
      \ grenade. Use a few to blast away these little guys.|Raff|Raff}}\nTake out\
      \ the Grenade Launcher and shoot the [[Predator]]s, which were originally created\
      \ by Legend for [[Unreal - Return to Na Pali]]. Raff continues his speech:\n\
      {{quoteSource|Notice that tapping your primary fire makes the grenades explode\
      \ on contact. If you're aiming on the run, hit something near your enemy and\
      \ he'll feel it. Holding down the trigger on the primary fire engages the timing\
      \ mechanism, so you can bounce the grenades around some before they explode.\
      \ Use your alt-fire to switch between grenade types. The crosshair on your HUD\
      \ will tell you which one is chambered. I've given you some incendiary grenades,\
      \ so load 'em up and prepare for a show.|Raff|Raff}}\nShoot with the Incendiary\
      \ grenades. Using the timed grenades makes it a lot harder task, so use the\
      \ tap fire. Raff now tells you:\n[[Image:U2TutorialSecret.png|right|thumb|200px|The\
      \ secret training area]]\n{{quoteSource|You're a natural, Dalton. Hey, I need\
      \ to test some features I just loaded. How 'bout you and I go one-on-one?|Raff|Raff}}\n\
      Raff opens the doors and walks inside. But wait - you saw 4 target doors! And\
      \ only 3 were opened. What lies beyond the last door? If you picked up the head\
      \ from a box earlier, you will see that the last doors opened, but Raff didn't\
      \ notice that. There is a pair of [[Nali]] standing there. When shot, they will\
      \ say something like \"Habouji!\" or \"Oboudah!\". Each nali has it's own 2\
      \ sounds, but the sounds appear to be odd, and one sound was not in Unreal.\n\
      \nWhen you're done, follow Raff and your weapons will be taken. You are now\
      \ about to start a deathmatch! Take the items you see in front of you, including\
      \ a Combat Assault Rifle, Dispersion Pistol, Grenade Launcher, a pack of Incendiary\
      \ grenades, four Assault Rifle clips and a pack of Fragmentation grenades, and\
      \ go through the doors, while Raff tells you more about it:\n{{quoteSource|Here's\
      \ how it works. I play as a holo, and my weapons are holographic too, but they'll\
      \ register on your armor as real hits. If you die, you go to full health and\
      \ shields, but I score a point. If I die, you get a point. Whoever gets to five\
      \ first, wins. If you get a kill, be sure to run over my \"holo-corpse\", so\
      \ your power armor absorbs any remaining energy and applies it to your shields.\
      \ If you wanna bail at any time, just push the button next to the exit and go\
      \ on through. One last word of advice - load up on ammo before you go in.|Raff|Raff}}\n\
      Take your Combat Assault Rifle and get ready for an [[Unreal Tournament]]-styled\
      \ [[Deathmatch]] action, with Unreal 2 addition of armor pickups. The fight\
      \ shouldn't be too hard. Raff can even kill himself with Incendiary grenades.\
      \ The arena itself is simple, including some pickups for all the weapons you\
      \ have and some health and energy pickups. Crates and columns enable you to\
      \ hide, but it's not too useful overall. The arena here could be compared to\
      \ [[UT2004]]'s [[DM-TrainingDay]]. Once you get five frags, Raff will congratulate\
      \ you and will offer another match. You can try it if you wish. If you want\
      \ to move on, decline.\n{{quoteSource|Maybe next time.|John Dalton|John Dalton}}\n\
      Raff will reply:\n[[Image:U2Tutorial7.png|right|thumb|200px|The recharge area]]\n\
      {{quoteSource|Good enough. Come on through the exit. Recharge your health and\
      \ shields. Just step inside each station and they'll work automatically.|Raff|Raff}}\n\
      Your weapons will be removed and you can go out. You will see a blue Shield\
      \ station and a yellow Health station, which you should step on to recharge.\
      \ You will also see another fenced area here, with a few crates that look close\
      \ enough to jump through. It's not true, as you can't mantle on the fence nor\
      \ the wire.\nAfter you've recharged (the shield station is quite short on power,\
      \ so it might not give you all of your shield back), go through the exit to\
      \ the first room and back to the control room. Raff greets you there:\n{{quoteSource|Whew!\
      \ That was great. Can't remember when I've had such a blast. Ya know, if I put\
      \ two flags in there, I could sell tickets, maybe get someone to sponsor a tournament.\
      \ Those guys over at Liandri have more money than brains... hmmm. Good luck,\
      \ Marshal. Go keep the frontier safe.|Raff|Raff}}\nRaff refers to the [[Liandri\
      \ Grand Tournament]], the main object of all the [[Unreal Tournament]] series.\
      \ No [[Capture the Flag]] maps on Avalon have ever been officially created though.\n\
      \nWith these words the level ends. You automatically return to your ship. A\
      \ cutscene follows.\n\n==Cutscene 2==\n[[Image:Intro3.png|right|thumb|200px|The\
      \ outro of Avalon (preface) level]]\nIn this cutscene, the track PD_AVALO.ogg\
      \ is played. A dropship rises off the planet's surface, and flies to [[TCA Atlantis]].\
      \ When it reaches the docking bay, John Dalton turns off the main engine and\
      \ enters the spaceship. TCA Antlantis flies away from Odyssey IV.\n{{clear}}\n\
