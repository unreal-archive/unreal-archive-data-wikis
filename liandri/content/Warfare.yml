      \ is similar to <a href=\"/Onslaught\" title=\"Onslaught\">Onslaught</a> - control\
      \ a chain of power nodes that link to the enemy core, and destroy it. However,\
      \ Warfare expands upon this idea so that there is more of a strategic element\
      \ involved in Warfare, and less of a rushdown. This article will mostly focus\
      \ on the new elements of Warfare (The Orb and extra node types); for information\
      \ on how to Construct Nodes/Attack enemy Powercores, scoring, etc, one should\
      \ look at the <a href=\"/Onslaught\" title=\"Onslaught\">Onslaught</a> section.\n\
      </p><p>Upon starting the game, each team will spawn in their base, and the <a\
      \ href=\"/Warfare#The_Orb\" title=\"Warfare\">Orb</a> will spawn. The Orb is\
      \ a crucial component of Warfare, and carefully using the Orb will be key to\
      \ winning Warfare matches. Some maps have multiple Orb spawnpoints depending\
      \ on which nodes are captured, while others only have one, inside each base.\
      \ You will be able to see where your Orb is at all times on the minimap.\n</p><p>Several\
      \ maps will also have ancillary nodes that, while not needed to win the match,\
      \ provide advantages to a team. These are <a href=\"/Warfare#Countdown_Nodes\"\

      \ game will briefly display the carrier's name underneath the minimap for all\
      \ players to see. Additionally, the orb carrier will have a bright yellow/gold\
      \ light extending up into the sky, making their location obvious to most other\
      \ players. The light is similar to a normal <a href=\"/Onslaught#Power_Node\"\
      \ title=\"Onslaught\">Power Node</a> except that it moves along with the Orb\
      \ carrier, always reflecting their current location. In addition, the carrier's\
      \ exact location is visible to any nearby enemies on the minimap. They will\
      \ also be warned with an \"Enemy Orb carrier incoming\" voice announcement.\
      \ Hence, the life of an orb carrier is extremely dangerous; however, if you\
      \ can stay alive, the benefits are great and the orb carrier can change the\
      \ tide for a losing team or secure a decisive victory for a winning one.\n</p>\n\
      <ul><li> If an orb carrier touches a node, assuming that his team can actually\
      \ capture the node, the node will be instantly captured and built, whether it\
      \ is neutral or owned by the enemy team. In addition, until the Orb vanishes\
      \ from inside the node, the node cannot be retaken by the enemy Orb. The only\
      \ exceptions to this rule are nodes you cannot normally capture anyway, and\
      \ nodes that have just been taken by the Orb.</li>\n<li> If an orb carrier approaches\
      \ a captured node, he will protect that node. The node will be automatically\
      \ healed by the power of the orb, and will not be able to be damaged as long\
      \ as the Orb carrier is alive, or until he moves a certain distance away from\
      \ the node, shown on your minimap by a dashed circular border. A bright, team-colored\
      \ stream of energy will directly connect the orb carrier to the node. It is\
      \ also impossible for the node to be captured by an enemy orb while it is protected.</li>\n\
      <li> If a player is killed while holding the orb, the orb drops, and if it was\
      \ being used defensively, defensive mechanisms cease. A countdown (18 seconds)\
      \ then begins; this countdown can be seen by all players on your team regardless\
      \ of distance as long as they are looking in the general direction of the orb,\
      \ becoming more opaque as they approach, and enemy players within a certain\
      \ distance of the Orb and general line-of-sight of it. If a player on the orb-owning\
      \ team picks up the Orb by touching it, the countdown is canceled and they then\
      \ have control of the orb. Alternatively, if they fail to retrieve it, the Orb\
      \ will be destroyed and respawn.</li>\n<li> A player may quickly destroy a dropped\
      \ enemy orb by walking up to it and pressing Use. However, due to the sudden\
      \ discharge, the player will lose 100 health. It is possible to suicide by doing\
      \ this, but a message will pop up proclaiming you decided to be a hero. Damage\
      \ from this can be soaked by armor, meaning if you have a full <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a> this will not\
      \ harm your health, at the cost of the Shield Belt. If you reach a fallen enemy\
      \ orb, it is generally a bad idea to force it to respawn unless that node is\
      \ getting rushed, because otherwise you put it right back where your opponents\
      \ are spawning.</li>\n<li> As with Flags, the Orb Carrier cannot use Teleporters\
      \ or Vehicles or else they will drop the Orb. It is possible as always for them\
      \ to grapple onto vehicles and/or use their hoverboards; getting shot will make\
      \ them fall and drop the Orb.</li></ul>\n<p><br />\nThe Orb provides for a way\
      \ for a team to manage to turn the tide of the match quickly with teamwork,\
      \ as opposed to Onslaught's general stalemate once a team's Prime Node is down.\
      \ Indeed, with a good run, a team who was winning the match can quickly find\
      \ their assault not only halted, but the tide of battle completely reversed.\n\

      \ necessary to capture to win the game, but capturing these nodes can provide\
      \ some benefits. In addition to the usual benefits of a captured node (additional\
      \ vehicles, respawns, etc) these nodes can inflict damage directly to the core,\
      \ even if your team doesn't have a direct link to it established. These nodes\
      \ are called Countdown Nodes.\n</p><p>Upon capturing a Countdown Node, the game\
      \ will audibly announce that a team has taken control of it, and a timer (usually\
      \ 60 seconds) appears at the location of the node on the minimap, along with\
      \ a final warning with 10 seconds to go. If the node fails to be destroyed within\
      \ that time, the team has succeeded in holding the countdown node, and the enemy\
      \ core will be damaged, usually for about 20% of its health. After the node\
      \ is held and the countdown successful, the node will return to a neutral state,\
      \ removing all spawns and friendly vehicles that spawned with them and are not\
      \ being used.\n</p><p>Examples of this type of node can be found on WAR-Floodgate\
      \ and WAR-Powersurge.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Vehicle_Nodes\"\

      \ Nodes are a subset of Countdown Nodes, but distinct enough to be separated.\
      \ Unlike Countdown Nodes, Vehicle Nodes will not directly damage the core; however,\

      \ the <a href=\"/Leviathan#Unreal_Tournament_3\" title=\"Leviathan\">Leviathan</a>.\n\
      </p><p>The 60-second countdown, Minimap indicators and post-hold returning to\
      \ neutrality are all otherwise identical to Countdown Nodes. Note there is NOT\
      \ a 10-second warning with Vehicle Nodes, generally.\n</p><p>Examples of this\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Some maps have nodes which, when controlled, allow\
      \ quicker access to certain parts of the map faster, or in ways less exposed\
      \ to attacks. These nodes generally do not provide advantages in terms of firepower,\
      \ but they can sometimes be used to get to an objective that <i>does</i> allow\
      \ you to do so.\n</p><p>Examples of this type of node can be found in <a href=\"\
      /WAR-TankCrossing\" title=\"WAR-TankCrossing\">WAR-TankCrossing</a> and <a href=\"\
      /WAR-OnyxCoast\" title=\"WAR-OnyxCoast\">WAR-OnyxCoast</a>.\n</p><p>In most\
      \ cases, these are tied to an objective. In <a href=\"/WAR-TankCrossing\" title=\"\
      WAR-TankCrossing\">WAR-TankCrossing</a>, for example, controlling the Bridge\
      \ Node will allow you to get your <a href=\"/Goliath\" title=\"Goliath\">Goliath</a>\
      \ across, to a pressure pad which exposes the enemy core, which can then be\
      \ shot by the Goliath. In <a href=\"/WAR-OnyxCoast\" title=\"WAR-OnyxCoast\"\
      >WAR-OnyxCoast</a>, the team who controls the Leviathan can only drive it across\

      \ node to be damaged in some way, making it more difficult for them to hold\
      \ or build the node. Unlike Countdown Nodes, there is no timer for them to work\
      \ - they do so continuously, albeit slowly.\n</p><p>Examples of this type of\
      \ node can be found on <a href=\"/WAR-Avalanche\" title=\"WAR-Avalanche\">WAR-Avalanche</a>,\
      \ where holding the side nodes cause a Necris Tentacle to be deployed. Both\
      \ nodes are necessary to deploy the tentacle. A node chain is not necessary\
      \ for the damage, and chaining to the node does not speed it up.\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ the enemy core, you might not be able to <i>attack</i> the enemy core.\n</p><p>Examples\

    text: "'''Warfare''' is a game mode in [[Unreal Tournament 3]]. It is generally\
      \ an evolution of [[UT2004]]'s [[Onslaught]].[[Image:avalanche.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The\
      \ red team base and the red team power core in one of the Warfare maps, [[WAR-Avalanche]].]]\n\
      \n==Information==\n[[Image:Node.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The red team's prime node\
      \ in [[WAR-Torlan]].]]\nThe main objective in Warfare is similar to [[Onslaught]]\
      \ - control a chain of power nodes that link to the enemy core, and destroy\
      \ it. However, Warfare expands upon this idea so that there is more of a strategic\
      \ element involved in Warfare, and less of a rushdown. This article will mostly\
      \ focus on the new elements of Warfare (The Orb and extra node types); for information\
      \ on how to Construct Nodes/Attack enemy Powercores, scoring, etc, one should\
      \ look at the [[Onslaught]] section.\n\nUpon starting the game, each team will\
      \ spawn in their base, and the [[Warfare#The Orb|Orb]] will spawn. The Orb is\
      \ a crucial component of Warfare, and carefully using the Orb will be key to\
      \ winning Warfare matches. Some maps have multiple Orb spawnpoints depending\
      \ on which nodes are captured, while others only have one, inside each base.\
      \ You will be able to see where your Orb is at all times on the minimap.\n\n\
      Several maps will also have ancillary nodes that, while not needed to win the\
      \ match, provide advantages to a team. These are [[Warfare#Countdown Nodes|Countdown\
      \ Nodes]], [[Warfare#Vehicle Nodes|Vehicle Nodes]], [[Warfare#Bridge Nodes|Bridge\
      \ Nodes]], [[Warfare#Damage Nodes|Damage Nodes]] and [[Warfare#Core Exposing\
      \ Nodes|Core Exposing Nodes]] respectively.\n\n== The Orb ==\n[[Image:Orb.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The\
      \ orb]]\nUpon picking up the orb, the game will briefly display the carrier's\
      \ name underneath the minimap for all players to see. Additionally, the orb\
      \ carrier will have a bright yellow/gold light extending up into the sky, making\
      \ their location obvious to most other players. The light is similar to a normal\
      \ [[Onslaught#Power Node|Power Node]] except that it moves along with the Orb\
      \ carrier, always reflecting their current location. In addition, the carrier's\
      \ exact location is visible to any nearby enemies on the minimap. They will\
      \ also be warned with an \"Enemy Orb carrier incoming\" voice announcement.\
      \ Hence, the life of an orb carrier is extremely dangerous; however, if you\
      \ can stay alive, the benefits are great and the orb carrier can change the\
      \ tide for a losing team or secure a decisive victory for a winning one.\n*\
      \ If an orb carrier touches a node, assuming that his team can actually capture\
      \ the node, the node will be instantly captured and built, whether it is neutral\
      \ or owned by the enemy team. In addition, until the Orb vanishes from inside\
      \ the node, the node cannot be retaken by the enemy Orb. The only exceptions\
      \ to this rule are nodes you cannot normally capture anyway, and nodes that\
      \ have just been taken by the Orb.\n* If an orb carrier approaches a captured\
      \ node, he will protect that node. The node will be automatically healed by\
      \ the power of the orb, and will not be able to be damaged as long as the Orb\
      \ carrier is alive, or until he moves a certain distance away from the node,\
      \ shown on your minimap by a dashed circular border. A bright, team-colored\
      \ stream of energy will directly connect the orb carrier to the node. It is\
      \ also impossible for the node to be captured by an enemy orb while it is protected.\n\
      * If a player is killed while holding the orb, the orb drops, and if it was\
      \ being used defensively, defensive mechanisms cease. A countdown (18 seconds)\
      \ then begins; this countdown can be seen by all players on your team regardless\
      \ of distance as long as they are looking in the general direction of the orb,\
      \ becoming more opaque as they approach, and enemy players within a certain\
      \ distance of the Orb and general line-of-sight of it. If a player on the orb-owning\
      \ team picks up the Orb by touching it, the countdown is canceled and they then\
      \ have control of the orb. Alternatively, if they fail to retrieve it, the Orb\
      \ will be destroyed and respawn.\n* A player may quickly destroy a dropped enemy\
      \ orb by walking up to it and pressing Use. However, due to the sudden discharge,\
      \ the player will lose 100 health. It is possible to suicide by doing this,\
      \ but a message will pop up proclaiming you decided to be a hero. Damage from\
      \ this can be soaked by armor, meaning if you have a full [[Shield Belt]] this\
      \ will not harm your health, at the cost of the Shield Belt. If you reach a\
      \ fallen enemy orb, it is generally a bad idea to force it to respawn unless\
      \ that node is getting rushed, because otherwise you put it right back where\
      \ your opponents are spawning.\n* As with Flags, the Orb Carrier cannot use\
      \ Teleporters or Vehicles or else they will drop the Orb. It is possible as\
      \ always for them to grapple onto vehicles and/or use their hoverboards; getting\
      \ shot will make them fall and drop the Orb.\n\n\nThe Orb provides for a way\
      \ for a team to manage to turn the tide of the match quickly with teamwork,\
      \ as opposed to Onslaught's general stalemate once a team's Prime Node is down.\
      \ Indeed, with a good run, a team who was winning the match can quickly find\
      \ their assault not only halted, but the tide of battle completely reversed.\n\
      \n== Countdown Nodes ==\nSome nodes aren't necessary to capture to win the game,\
      \ but capturing these nodes can provide some benefits. In addition to the usual\
      \ benefits of a captured node (additional vehicles, respawns, etc) these nodes\
      \ can inflict damage directly to the core, even if your team doesn't have a\
      \ direct link to it established. These nodes are called Countdown Nodes.\n\n\
      Upon capturing a Countdown Node, the game will audibly announce that a team\
      \ has taken control of it, and a timer (usually 60 seconds) appears at the location\
      \ of the node on the minimap, along with a final warning with 10 seconds to\
      \ go. If the node fails to be destroyed within that time, the team has succeeded\
      \ in holding the countdown node, and the enemy core will be damaged, usually\
      \ for about 20% of its health. After the node is held and the countdown successful,\
      \ the node will return to a neutral state, removing all spawns and friendly\
      \ vehicles that spawned with them and are not being used.\n\nExamples of this\
      \ type of node can be found on WAR-Floodgate and WAR-Powersurge.\n\n=== Vehicle\
      \ Nodes ===\nVehicle Nodes are a subset of Countdown Nodes, but distinct enough\
      \ to be separated. Unlike Countdown Nodes, Vehicle Nodes will not directly damage\
      \ the core; however, they will give the team who holds them a vehicle of tremendous\
      \ power, generally the [[Leviathan#Unreal Tournament 3|Leviathan]].\n\nThe 60-second\
      \ countdown, Minimap indicators and post-hold returning to neutrality are all\
      \ otherwise identical to Countdown Nodes. Note there is NOT a 10-second warning\
      \ with Vehicle Nodes, generally.\n\nExamples of this type of node can be found\
      \ on WAR-Serenity.\n\n== Bridge Nodes ==\nSome maps have nodes which, when controlled,\
      \ allow quicker access to certain parts of the map faster, or in ways less exposed\
      \ to attacks. These nodes generally do not provide advantages in terms of firepower,\
      \ but they can sometimes be used to get to an objective that ''does'' allow\
      \ you to do so.\n\nExamples of this type of node can be found in [[WAR-TankCrossing]]\
      \ and [[WAR-OnyxCoast]].\n\nIn most cases, these are tied to an objective. In\
      \ [[WAR-TankCrossing]], for example, controlling the Bridge Node will allow\
      \ you to get your [[Goliath]] across, to a pressure pad which exposes the enemy\
      \ core, which can then be shot by the Goliath. In [[WAR-OnyxCoast]], the team\
      \ who controls the Leviathan can only drive it across the bridge if they can\
      \ successfully hold the Bridge Node.\n\n== Damage Nodes ==\n\nDamage Nodes are\
      \ nodes that, when held, cause an enemy's node to be damaged in some way, making\
      \ it more difficult for them to hold or build the node. Unlike Countdown Nodes,\
      \ there is no timer for them to work - they do so continuously, albeit slowly.\n\
      \nExamples of this type of node can be found on [[WAR-Avalanche]], where holding\
      \ the side nodes cause a Necris Tentacle to be deployed. Both nodes are necessary\
      \ to deploy the tentacle. A node chain is not necessary for the damage, and\
      \ chaining to the node does not speed it up.\n\n== Core Exposing Nodes ==\n\n\
      These nodes will expose the enemy core, making it easier to attack, usually\
      \ from a distance. It should be noted, however, that while they will ''expose''\
      \ the enemy core, you might not be able to ''attack'' the enemy core.\n\nExamples\
      \ of this type of node can be found in [[WAR-MarketDistrict]].\n\n== Support\
      \ Nodes ==\n\nThere are also generic Support Nodes, which require no core linking\
      \ to capture, that also don't have a special effect. These nodes may supply\
      \ you with stronger vehicle(s), more weapons and ammo, and serve as an additional\
      \ possible spawn point. Examples include most versions of [[WAR-Torlan]] and\
      \ the [[WAR-Dusk]] standard link setup. In the latter case, if a team controls\
      \ both of the Support Nodes surrounding the mine shaft, the shaft door will\
      \ open, revealing a [[Cicada]], which is particularly useful for attacking nodes\
      \ in that map.\n\n== See Also ==\n[[:Category:Warfare maps|Warfare maps]]\n\n\
