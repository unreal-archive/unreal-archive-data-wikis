      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>You start in the corridor leading from the exit of the previous level.\
      \ The corridor leads round to the right, so follow it. Going round a corner\
      \ to te left, you emerge in an outdoor area on a walkway above a pool of hazardous\
      \ sludge.\n</p><p>Follow this walkway. You will approach a raised section of\
      \ walkway blocking your path. You will also see a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> high\
      \ up above a buttress to the right, but you can't reach it from here. To lower\
      \ the raised section, press the lever attached to the right support pillar for\
      \ a gantry above the walkway. The obstruction lowers, completing the walkway\
      \ and revealing a large <a href=\"/Behemoth\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Behemoth\">Behemoth</a>. Flak bomb it until it dies, then continue along the\
      \ walkway, following in as it corners round to the right. You will soom go through\
      \ a door and enter a corridor within the facility.\n</p><p>Follow the corridor.\
      \ You will see glass windows to either side behind which are useful items. As\
      \ you continue down the corridor, the last pair of windows smash open and a\
      \ <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\">Brute</a> comes out. Kill it. Visit the\
      \ alcoves revealed by the breakage of the last two windows for a box of 10 Flak\
      \ Shells and a <a href=\"/Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health\
      \ Pack\">Health Pack</a>. Then, return down the corridor and smash the other\
      \ four windows to obtain a Health Pack, another box of 10 Flak Shells, a box\
      \ of 8 Rifle Rounds and an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a>.\n</p><p>Back at the starting end of the corridor,\
      \ look up at the roof in the direction of the entrance. You will see a hole\
      \ in the ceiling and a button on the wall beneath it. You may wish to use your\
      \ <a href=\"/Searchlight\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Searchlight\">Searchlight</a>\
      \ to illuminate the wall if you don't immediately see the button.\n</p><p>Shoot\
      \ the button. A panel opens in the corridor wall to the right. Entering the\
      \ revealed passage, you can climb the steps within to obtain a pair of <a href=\"\
      /Jump_Boots\" title=\"Jump Boots\">Jump Boots</a> at the top. Now that you have\
      \ the boots, you can obtain the Super Health Pack you saw earlier. Return down\
      \ the steps and go outside. Stand on the main straight of the walkway facing\
      \ the buttress. Using your Jump Boots, do a run jump from that position. You\
      \ will land on the intermediate level of the buttress. Do another jump, and\
      \ you land on top where you can collect the Super Health Pack.\n</p><p>Collect\
      \ the pack then follow a hole in the wall from your position. Turning left,\
      \ you will follow a short passage before dropping back down into the corridor\
      \ through the hole in the ceiling by the button. Follow the corridor into the\
      \ facility. Go the full distance this time. Turning right out at the end, you\
      \ will arrive in a room above a waste tank below where sludge flows up an unbreakable\
      \ glass pipe to the right.\n</p><p>Go on into the room. A ramp at the back leads\
      \ up onto a low balcony. Go beneath the ramp and into the recess there for two\
      \ Clips. Then, step back into the room and climb the ramp onto the balcony.\
      \ Follow the balcony round to the right. It turns a corner round the outside\
      \ of the room, leading you past a doorway, towards a panel. Near the panel,\
      \ a <a href=\"/Toxin_Suit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Toxin Suit\">Toxin\
      \ Suit</a> is stored behind a glass window but you can't break it. So, return\
      \ along the balcony and go through the door instead.\n</p><p>You are lead on\
      \ an anticlockwise curve round a corridor. At the half way point, you will pass\
      \ a lift shaft and a large red button on the left.\n</p><p>Leave the lift for\
      \ the moment and follow the corridor on round. You will shortly emerge on a\
      \ low balcony in another tank room that is symmetrical with the previous one.\
      \ Watch out here though for a <a href=\"/Pupa\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Pupa\">Pupa</a> that attacks from the side. Kill the Pupa then go along the\
      \ balcony towards the panel to the right and open a wooden crate there for a\
      \ box of 10 Flak Shells. You will see a second Toxin Suit behind another unbreakable\
      \ glass window here too.\n</p><p>Drop to the floor of the room and kill the\
      \ Pupa that attacks from under the balcony. Then, go under the balcony ramp\
      \ for a box of 8 Rifle Rounds. You're done here, so return to the room and climb\
      \ back onto the balcony. There, go back through the door and return to the lift\
      \ you saw earlier.\n</p><p>Press the large red button. The lift will descend.\
      \ Step aboard and ride it up to the top; you will be in a small foyer guarded\
      \ by a particularly nasty SkaarjAssassin. Kill the <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"\
      Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> - you may end up going up and down the lift several times\
      \ in the process. In the foyer: there are two boxes of 10 Flak Shells available\
      \ to either side of a corridor that goes straight out of this area. Collect\
      \ the ammo, then follow this corridor through to the next area.\n</p><p>This\
      \ next area turns out to be a balcony room raised above the two tank rooms,\
      \ which are to either side. The balcony is guarded by a SkaarjWarrior that you\
      \ should kill. Then, at this end of the area, go to the balcony edges to either\
      \ side to retrieve two ASMD Cores. Go to the back of this area and destroy two\
      \ sludge barrels there. In the shadows there is a door which opens as you approach,\
      \ revealing a T-junction with corridors leading off to either side beneath a\
      \ madly flickering light.\n</p><p>Enter the junction and kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ and Pupae that attack from the sides. Then, take a left along the corridor\
      \ from the junction, entering the next area which is a kind of control room.\n\
      </p><p>Read the large slanted panel on the left in this control room for some\
      \ information [1].\n</p><p>A corridor leads out of the control room to the left.\
      \ Follow it, killing another Pupa lurking at the end. You will find a large\
      \ control wheel at the end of the corridor; activate it. Return through the\
      \ control room to the T-junction and go straight across. You will enter another\
      \ control room - this whole part of the plant is symmetrical. Read the panels\
      \ here [2].\n</p><p>Proceed through the corridor to the right here and you will\
      \ find the other pump control area. This one is guarded by three Pupae - kill\
      \ them, then activate the second pump wheel. The ground rocks and you hear an\
      \ explosion. Warning lights and alarms activate above you. Looks like all hell\
      \ has let loose...\n</p><p>Return through the control room and approach the\
      \ T-junction. Upon arrival, you will be charged by a Behemoth. Kill the Behemoth\
      \ then return from the junction to the balcony area above the tank rooms. Drop\
      \ off the balcony edge to the right such that you land on the raised area of\
      \ the first tank room.\n</p><p>The glass pipe to the sludge tank has been smashed\
      \ by the explosion, and you're going to take a swim. First, though, heed the\
      \ warnings of the panels and collect the Toxin Suit from the alcove to the side\
      \ - the glass winow has been removed. Now, drop to the floor of the room and\
      \ approach the pipe, then dive into the sludge.\n</p><p>You land in a short\
      \ submerged section of curving pipe. Follow it down and you emerge in the sludge\
      \ tank proper. In the tank, you can go in either direction to your sides - go\
      \ first to the left. Following the tank round a corner, you will reach a dead\
      \ end where you can collect a Super Health Pack from the floor. Switch to your\
      \ <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a>, <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a>,\
      \ <a href=\"/ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a> or another\
      \ good underwater weapon, then head back through the tank. Kill a <a href=\"\
      /Slith\" title=\"Slith\">Slith</a> that attacks you as you return to the main\
      \ part of the tank. Remember that the Toxin Suit will protect you from the Slith's\
      \ saliva attack but not from its claws - and that taking damage will compromise\
      \ your Toxin Suit.\n</p><p>When the Slith is dead, proceed through the tank,\
      \ collecting a Clip from the recess opposite the pipe by which you entered.\
      \ At the end of the tank, you will pass through a sludge tunnel, shortly emerging\
      \ in the other part of the tank beneath the other room.\n</p><p>This part of\
      \ the tank stretches on ahead. If you have taken damage and your suit has been\
      \ weakened, you might want to go through the pipe on the right which leads out\
      \ into the second tank room so that you can collect the second Toxin Suit you\
      \ saw earlier. When you're done, proceed through the second part of the sludge\
      \ tank. Turning round to the left at the corner ahead and following the tank\
      \ to the end, you can surface and climb out of the gunge into a corridor.\n\
      </p><p>Follow this corridor loop round in either direction from where you surfaced.\
      \ At the other end, you will reach a doorway and a short corridor that lead\
      \ to an outdoor area where a LesserBrute snipes from a raised balcony to the\
      \ left. Kill the LesserBrute. This outdoor area has a central passageway that\
      \ leads to another door ahead, and there are ramps to either side that lead\
      \ up on to the raised balconies. Climb the ramps onto the raised balcony to\
      \ the right to find a UMS drop box that reveals a <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher#Unreal:_RTNP\"\
      \ title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a>.\n</p><p>Go to the back end\
      \ of this balcony. There's a hole there down to a sludge tank. Toxin Suit permitting,\
      \ drop down into the ankle-level sludge. You are in one of four such small tanks\
      \ connected by a ring of dry tunnels. Go clockwise round the ring - the first\
      \ two tunnels contain a 25kg can of Tarydium Sludge each. The tanks themselves\
      \ contain damaged lifts. The third tank will contain a UMS drop box that reveals\
      \ a <a href=\"/Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"Grenade Launcher\">Grenade Launcher</a>.\
      \ The fourth tank contains an undamaged lift - step on it and ride to the top\
      \ to emerge on the opposite balcony above.\n</p><p>Step off the balcony and\
      \ approach the other entrance from this outdoor area. There, you can collect\
      \ a GES <a href=\"/Biorifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Biorifle\">Biorifle</a>\
      \ and two further 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge. Proceed into the corridor from\
      \ the entrance here to collect an ASMD, but watch out as you do so because doors\
      \ open ahead to reveal a SkaarjWarrior right in your face.\n</p><p>Kill the\
      \ Skaarj and follow the corridor beyond. Curving round to the right, you emerge\
      \ in an outdoor area where a SkaarjLord ambushes you from the left. Back off\
      \ and kill the Skaarj, then return to the outdoor area and look around.\n</p><p>You\
      \ are on a walkway raised above the ground level below. Supports placed periodically\
      \ on either side hold the walkway in place. Go to the point ahead where the\
      \ walkway corners to the left, on the way visiting one of the supports on the\
      \ left for a <a href=\"/Can_of_12_Eightballs\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Can of 12 Eightballs\">can of 12 Eightballs</a>, and open a UMS drop box at\
      \ the corner for a pack of 10 Grenades. Then, drop off the walkway onto the\
      \ ground area below.\n</p><p>Explore the ground area. It is an L-shaped piece\
      \ of grass with metal causeways around the edges. If you visit the corners at\
      \ the far ends of the area, you can collect a total of four ASMD Cores. You\
      \ will also find a UMS drop box that contains another pack of 10 Grenades. When\
      \ you're done collecting gear, go to the turning point of the L-shaped area.\
      \ You will see a corridor entrance; go inside and you will find that it leads\
      \ to a lift.\n</p><p>Enter the corridor but don't go up the lift yet - you can\
      \ hear Pupae hissing at the top. So, lob a couple of Grenades up the lift shaft\
      \ to dispose of them. Then, step aboard the lift and ride it to the low corridor\
      \ at the top. Collect the Health Pack there then follow the corridor round to\
      \ the right. A wall will open and you can descend one of the supports back on\
      \ to the raised walkway.\n</p><p>Follow the walkway now towards the door at\
      \ the far end. Visit an intermediate support on the right for a Health Pack.\
      \ When you reach the far end, visit the supports to either side for two boxes\
      \ of 10 Flak Shells. Open the door at this end of the walkway. Kill a SkaarjAssassin\
      \ that ambushes you from beyond. Entering, follow the corridor inside round\
      \ to the right and kill the two Pupae that crawl out from a recess on the right.\
      \ Then, go to the end of the corridor and through the doors there to arrive\
      \ in a large room.\n</p><p>This room is some kind of hangar. There are some\
      \ large garage-type doors on the left and a large crane mounted on roof beams.\
      \ First things first, you will probably hear something coming through doors\
      \ behind you, so go back out into the corridor and dispose of the incoming SkaarjWarrior.\n\
      </p><p>Return to the hangar. You are on a slightly raised balcony. Step forwards\
      \ on to some boxes for two ASMD Cores. Then, go to the far end of the room.\
      \ On the way check the huge door - it is locked. At the far end of the room\
      \ go beneath the balcony for an Assault Vest. There are steps back up to the\
      \ balcony here, so go up them and collect the replacement Toxin Suit from on\
      \ top. Follow the balcony to the left, going via a Health Pack on a box nearby\
      \ if you need to, and approach the large lever at the end with a picture of\
      \ the crane above it. The lever does not activate - you get this message [3].\n\
      </p><p>Drop back down to the floor of the hangar and look to the right of the\
      \ balcony steps. A ramp slopes down to a corridor full of sludge. Ahead at the\
      \ far end you will see a room with a control wheel.\n</p><p>First, submerge\
      \ and go down into the tank beneath the room with the control wheel. You are\
      \ in a tank with barred entrances through to another tank - the bars are locked,\
      \ but you can take this opportunity to safely dispose of a Slith beyond. Return\
      \ to the corridor and surface, climbing out into the room with the control wheel.\
      \ Look to either side - you can collect two ASMD Cores from near two sets of\
      \ small sealed doors. Activate the control wheel and the sealed doors open;\
      \ go through the ones to the right and collect the Health Pack beyond, but watch\
      \ out for a Slith in the room to the left.\n</p><p>The doors have sealed again\
      \ behind you, so go on into the room. There, you will find a red button on the\
      \ left wall beneath a panel with a picture of the crane on it. Press the button.\
      \ Now, if you continue on round to the left, you can collect a Health Pack but\
      \ you are just back at the other sealed doors and they won't open. So, return\
      \ to the area by the control button and drop through a hole in the floor there\
      \ into a sludge tank below.\n</p><p>This tank is the one you saw barred off\
      \ just now. Approach one of the sets of bars and it opens, allowing you to pass\
      \ through. Return through the sludge to the ramp up to the hangar. Climb back\
      \ out into the hangar, but beware two Pupae which drop off the balcony from\
      \ behind.\n</p><p>Use the steps to climb back onto the balcony. The crane controls\
      \ should be active now, so go along the balcony and press the lever. The crane\
      \ swings into action, swivelling around the room and smashing into the huge\
      \ garage-type door.\n</p><p>With explosions, part of the door smashes open.\
      \ Drop to the floor and go through the gap into the room beyond - beware a Pupa\
      \ that attacks from ahead. Go into the room and round the next corner - you'll\
      \ have to kill a SkaarjAssassin and another Pupa, so be ready. Further into\
      \ the room is a door on the left which is locked. Continue round the room. Shortly\
      \ you'll reach steps onto the raised area to the right. If you're short of Eightballs,\
      \ go up onto that balcony and follow it right round to its end, where you can\
      \ open wooden crates for a can of 12.\n</p><p>Continue round to the end of the\
      \ room. Turning left, you'll emerge in a large room with a huge raised storage\
      \ tank in the middle. There's a balcony above you. Look up and around until\
      \ you see a Behemoth on patrol. Kill it while you have the element of surprise.\n\
      </p><p>Go to the far end of this large room. Ahead to the left is a doorway\
      \ into a corridor. As you reach the end of the huge tank on the right, two Pupae\
      \ attack from beyond some control panels. Kill them. Then, go to the right past\
      \ the control panels. You'll find a lift in the corner onto the balcony the\
      \ Behemoth was patrolling. Ride it up and look at the tank from above - it is\
      \ sealed shut. Follow the balcony right round the room. At the corners you'll\
      \ find two Health Packs, and at the far end wooden crates reveal an <a href=\"\
      /Eightball_Gun\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eightball Gun\">Eightball Gun</a>\
      \ and two cans of 12 Eightballs.\n</p><p>Drop back down at this end of the room.\
      \ Go through the corridor entrance you saw before. Following the corridor clockwise,\
      \ a SkaarjAssassin attacks out of an alcove to the right which also contains\
      \ a Toxin Suit. Kill it but don't collect the Toxin Suit yet.\n</p><p>Go on\
      \ round the corridor. In the next straight stretch, a Pupa attacks from behind\
      \ conduits to the left. Kill the Pupa, then go between the two verticals and\
      \ round behind for two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge.\n</p><p>Go along the corridor.\
      \ At the end, press a large red button on the right to call a lift ahead. As\
      \ the lift descends, kill the SkaarjWarrior that comes down with it. Step aboard\
      \ and ride the lift up - if necessary, call it again. At the top, turn off to\
      \ the right and enter the control room there with a view of the huge storage\
      \ tank.\n</p><p>Collect the two boxes of Flak Shells you find to either side\
      \ in the control room, then press the lever ahead. Look through one of the viewing\
      \ windows ahead, and you will see the large storage tank open.\n</p><p>Return\
      \ to the lift and press the large red button there to descend. Step off and\
      \ follow the corridor back round to the tank room, collecting that Toxin Suit\
      \ on the way. Go across the end of the tank room past the panels, and ride the\
      \ lift onto the balcony again. Select a good underwater weapon (CAR, ASMD, <a\
      \ href=\"/Minigun\" title=\"Minigun\">Minigun</a>, Stinger etc.) and jump across\
      \ to the tank. Plunge in - immediately you will have to deal with a Slith -\
      \ don't let it destroy your Toxin Suit, or you're scuppered.\n</p><p>Look at\
      \ either end in the tank. At one end is a can of 12 Eightballs - collect the\
      \ ammo. At the other end is a pipe - enter it. It leads you downwards, and you\
      \ emerge at the other end in a large tank of sludge beneath the main room above.\
      \ Kill a Slith lurking here with your ASMD. Go first to the right. At the end,\
      \ you'll reach an extension of the tank to the left. Eliminate a Slith that\
      \ comes from the far end, then go down to the end yourself to get an Energy\
      \ Amplifier plus two Clips on top of a support. Return to the main tank and\
      \ go through it to the other end. Collect an ASMD Core from the centre of the\
      \ floor on the way. At the end, head off to the right down an extension of the\
      \ tank there. Collect an ASMD Core from the floor by a low entrance to the left\
      \ and destroy a Slith that sights you from down the tunnel there. Go through\
      \ the tunnel beyond the entrance and collect another ASMD Core from the floor\
      \ at the far end.\n</p><p>Stay facing in that direction and surface. You will\
      \ come out at the end of a shallow pool of sludge. Head immediately across it\
      \ and climb the ramp at the far end of it onto a raised walkway, because a SkaarjAssassin\
      \ has seen you and launched an attack - and you don't want to be caught in the\
      \ Sludge without a suit.\n</p><p>If you still have your suit when the Skaarj\
      \ is dead, there's a Health Pack in the shallow pool between balcony supports\
      \ to one side. When you've collected the pack, climb out again and follow the\
      \ balcony round to the left. You'll reach a door and a button. Press the button\
      \ to open the door, which leads back out to the room beyond the hangar should\
      \ you wish to backtrack at all. You however probably don't, so go back out onto\
      \ the balcony.\n</p><p>Pressing the button has also opened alcoves further round\
      \ the balcony. The alcoves contain wooden crates - shoot them open to reveal\
      \ an ASMD Core and a useful <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>. Collect, then go on round the balcony past the\
      \ ramp out of the sludge. You'll enter a short curving corridor. Follow the\
      \ curving corridor round to the right. You'll enter the next room and there\
      \ will be the sound of an explosion from somewhere as a SkaarjAssassin drops\
      \ down from a hole in the ceiling. Kill the Skaarj and enter the room a bit\
      \ further. Ventilation grilles at ground level burst open and two Pupae will\
      \ attack - kill them both.\n</p><p>Go across the room. You'll cross a metal\
      \ panel in the floor as you approach a lift at the back. Reaching the lift,\
      \ it descends and you can step aboard to ride it to a raised balcony at the\
      \ back. Open a wooden crate on the lift for a Health Pack.\n</p><p>At the top\
      \ of the lift you are on the balcony. Go to the right to find wooden crates\
      \ that reveal two ASMD Cores, then turn round and go to the other end of the\
      \ balcony to enter a corridor there. Following the corridor round an anticlockwise\
      \ curve, you'll reach a small control room. Press a lever here - you'll also\
      \ get the following message [4].\n</p><p>Once you have pressed the lever, return\
      \ along the corridor. Expect to be met outside by a SkaarjWarrior. Kill the\
      \ Skaarj, then look down at the main floor of the room. You'll see that the\
      \ floor panel has been removed. Drop to the floor and look down the hole.\n\
      </p><p>The hole is a shaft down to a lift at the bottom. Drop down and land\
      \ on the lift, which spins you rapidly back up into the room above, then up\
      \ through a hole in the ceiling, shortly arriving in a corridor T-junction.\
      \ There are three ways you can go from here. The corridor heads off in either\
      \ direction. The third goes to an outdoor area - take this route now, but expect\
      \ to be attacked from the right by a SkaarjAssassin.\n</p><p>This outdoor area\
      \ is some kind of dock, with a small control building in the centre. There's\
      \ a Skaarj skimmer shuttle here, but it is inoperative. Head along to the left;\
      \ you'll find an UMS drop box that reveals a <a href=\"/Rocket_Pack#Unreal:_RTNP\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rocket Pack\">pack of 10 Rockets</a>. You'll\
      \ also be able to look down on to the L-shaped outdoor area from earlier - don't\
      \ fall in! Here, you can cross one of the support gantries over the gap for\
      \ a box of 10 Flak Shells.\n</p><p>Continue clockwise round the outdoor area.\
      \ Jumping over at the next corner, you can go for another UMS drop box that\
      \ reveals two 50 bullet CAR Clips and a Combat Assault Rifle. A support gantry\
      \ in this vicinity carries a Health Pack. Go on round and cross the last support\
      \ gantry for a box of 10 Flak Shells, thereby arriving near the entrance to\
      \ the control building. Kill a Pupa lurking inside, then open wooden crates\
      \ to reveal an ASMD Core, a box of 10 Flak Shells and another Pupa. Nothing\
      \ else that you can do out here after that, so return to the corridor entrance\
      \ and the T-junction.\n</p><p>From here, the corridor leads off to the left\
      \ and right. There are also viewing holes ahead down to the room with the balcony\
      \ below. One of them contains a Health Pack. Both holes have below them ASMD\
      \ Cores placed on roof beams if you need them, but if you'll get them you'll\
      \ have to coma back up via the spinning lift.\n</p><p>Take either of the corridors\
      \ from the T-junction - one of them has a Pupa behind a crate, the other has\
      \ two, but both lead to the same place. You'll be taken round a curve to a room\
      \ at the back with a transport cart at the centre.\n</p><p>A SkaarjAssassin\
      \ guards this room - kill it. Before stepping on the cart, two ASMD Cores raised\
      \ on boxes in this room can be collected by jumping via a pipe at the back.\
      \ Shoot the wooden crate on the cart open for a box of 10 Flak Shells, then\
      \ step aboard and collect the ammo. The cart will take you down a sloping tunnel,\
      \ before emerging in a room at the bottom where you will be attacked from the\
      \ left by a Pupa and from above or behind by a SkaarjAssassin.\n</p><p>Look\
      \ around the room. To the left is a door which is locked. To the right, a doorway\
      \ leads into a corridor. Boxes here have on top of them a Super Health pack\
      \ and, over the other side of the room, a box of 10 Flak Shells, but you can't\
      \ reach them from here, so head off through the open door to your right and\
      \ enter the corridor.\n</p><p>As you follow the corridor, you will pass a switch\
      \ bank on the left. Press a lever there and go on round the corridor - you have\
      \ called a lift at the far end on which there is a LesserBrute. Kill the LesserBrute\
      \ then ride the lift as it goes back up. You emerge on a balcony above the room.\
      \ A crane ahead is controlled by a lever on the left. Ignore that for now and\
      \ go to the edge and look down. You can just see the edge of the boxes carrying\
      \ the Super Health Pack. With a little bit of nifty control, you can drop down\
      \ on to the boxes and grab the pack.\n</p><p>Go back round the corridor and\
      \ activate the lift again, returning to the balcony. Press the lever on the\
      \ left this time, and watch as the crane swivels across from a balcony on the\
      \ far side of the room. When the crane reaches your balcony, jump up onto its\
      \ lower ring and ride it as it swivels back across the room to a similar balcony\
      \ on the far side.\n</p><p>There's a switch on this balcony and also two wooden\
      \ crates. Destroy the crates for a Health Pack and an Assault Vest, then press\
      \ the switch. The locked door on the floor below opens to reveal a corridor.\
      \ There's a Skaarj in the corridor - snipe it, then drop down to the floor via\
      \ the box of 10 Flak Shells on the box below.\n</p><p>Enter the corridor and\
      \ follow it round. As you reach the end, the ground turns into a lift which\
      \ takes you slowly down. Stepping off to the right at the bottom, you will be\
      \ in a large dark tunnel lit only by emergency beacons. Go along this tunnel,\
      \ collecting a box of 10 Flak Shells on the way, until you descend another lift\
      \ at the end. You will be taken down further into a similar tunnel where you\
      \ can collect a can of 12 Eightballs. Follow this tunnel to the end and descend\
      \ another lift. You will arrive in a foggy, fume-filled room with a hole in\
      \ the centre of the floor. Prepare yourself for a fight, because as you approach\
      \ the hole, a lift rises up it bringing with it a gigantic mutant SkaarjLord.\
      \ Take it down as best you can - try not to take too much damage.\n</p><p>When\
      \ the creature is dead, the lift descends, revealing a dank tunnel at the bottom\
      \ shallowly filled with sludge. Follow the tunnel. It winds round several times,\
      \ until you reach a room full of sludge waterfalls. There, climb on to a lift\
      \ in the centre and ride it up to the top to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\
      \nYou start in the corridor leading from the exit of the previous level. The\
      \ corridor leads round to the right, so follow it. Going round a corner to te\
      \ left, you emerge in an outdoor area on a walkway above a pool of hazardous\
      \ sludge.\n\nFollow this walkway. You will approach a raised section of walkway\
      \ blocking your path. You will also see a [[Super Health Pack]] high up above\
      \ a buttress to the right, but you can't reach it from here. To lower the raised\
      \ section, press the lever attached to the right support pillar for a gantry\
      \ above the walkway. The obstruction lowers, completing the walkway and revealing\
      \ a large [[Behemoth]]. Flak bomb it until it dies, then continue along the\
      \ walkway, following in as it corners round to the right. You will soom go through\
      \ a door and enter a corridor within the facility.\n\nFollow the corridor. You\
      \ will see glass windows to either side behind which are useful items. As you\
      \ continue down the corridor, the last pair of windows smash open and a [[Brute]]\
      \ comes out. Kill it. Visit the alcoves revealed by the breakage of the last\
      \ two windows for a box of 10 Flak Shells and a [[Health Pack]]. Then, return\
      \ down the corridor and smash the other four windows to obtain a Health Pack,\
      \ another box of 10 Flak Shells, a box of 8 Rifle Rounds and an [[Assault Vest]].\n\
      \nBack at the starting end of the corridor, look up at the roof in the direction\
      \ of the entrance. You will see a hole in the ceiling and a button on the wall\
      \ beneath it. You may wish to use your [[Searchlight]] to illuminate the wall\
      \ if you don't immediately see the button.\n\nShoot the button. A panel opens\
      \ in the corridor wall to the right. Entering the revealed passage, you can\
      \ climb the steps within to obtain a pair of [[Jump Boots]] at the top. Now\
      \ that you have the boots, you can obtain the Super Health Pack you saw earlier.\
      \ Return down the steps and go outside. Stand on the main straight of the walkway\
      \ facing the buttress. Using your Jump Boots, do a run jump from that position.\
      \ You will land on the intermediate level of the buttress. Do another jump,\
      \ and you land on top where you can collect the Super Health Pack.\n\nCollect\
      \ the pack then follow a hole in the wall from your position. Turning left,\
      \ you will follow a short passage before dropping back down into the corridor\
      \ through the hole in the ceiling by the button. Follow the corridor into the\
      \ facility. Go the full distance this time. Turning right out at the end, you\
      \ will arrive in a room above a waste tank below where sludge flows up an unbreakable\
      \ glass pipe to the right.\n\nGo on into the room. A ramp at the back leads\
      \ up onto a low balcony. Go beneath the ramp and into the recess there for two\
      \ Clips. Then, step back into the room and climb the ramp onto the balcony.\
      \ Follow the balcony round to the right. It turns a corner round the outside\
      \ of the room, leading you past a doorway, towards a panel. Near the panel,\
      \ a [[Toxin Suit]] is stored behind a glass window but you can't break it. So,\
      \ return along the balcony and go through the door instead.\n\nYou are lead\
      \ on an anticlockwise curve round a corridor. At the half way point, you will\
      \ pass a lift shaft and a large red button on the left.\n\nLeave the lift for\
      \ the moment and follow the corridor on round. You will shortly emerge on a\
      \ low balcony in another tank room that is symmetrical with the previous one.\
      \ Watch out here though for a [[Pupa]] that attacks from the side. Kill the\
      \ Pupa then go along the balcony towards the panel to the right and open a wooden\
      \ crate there for a box of 10 Flak Shells. You will see a second Toxin Suit\
      \ behind another unbreakable glass window here too.\n\nDrop to the floor of\
      \ the room and kill the Pupa that attacks from under the balcony. Then, go under\
      \ the balcony ramp for a box of 8 Rifle Rounds. You're done here, so return\
      \ to the room and climb back onto the balcony. There, go back through the door\
      \ and return to the lift you saw earlier.\n\nPress the large red button. The\
      \ lift will descend. Step aboard and ride it up to the top; you will be in a\
      \ small foyer guarded by a particularly nasty SkaarjAssassin. Kill the [[Skaarj]]\
      \ - you may end up going up and down the lift several times in the process.\
      \ In the foyer: there are two boxes of 10 Flak Shells available to either side\
      \ of a corridor that goes straight out of this area. Collect the ammo, then\
      \ follow this corridor through to the next area.\n\nThis next area turns out\
      \ to be a balcony room raised above the two tank rooms, which are to either\
      \ side. The balcony is guarded by a SkaarjWarrior that you should kill. Then,\
      \ at this end of the area, go to the balcony edges to either side to retrieve\
      \ two ASMD Cores. Go to the back of this area and destroy two sludge barrels\
      \ there. In the shadows there is a door which opens as you approach, revealing\
      \ a T-junction with corridors leading off to either side beneath a madly flickering\
      \ light.\n\nEnter the junction and kill the SkaarjWarrior and Pupae that attack\
      \ from the sides. Then, take a left along the corridor from the junction, entering\
      \ the next area which is a kind of control room.\n\nRead the large slanted panel\
      \ on the left in this control room for some information [1].\n\nA corridor leads\
      \ out of the control room to the left. Follow it, killing another Pupa lurking\
      \ at the end. You will find a large control wheel at the end of the corridor;\
      \ activate it. Return through the control room to the T-junction and go straight\
      \ across. You will enter another control room - this whole part of the plant\
      \ is symmetrical. Read the panels here [2].\n\nProceed through the corridor\
      \ to the right here and you will find the other pump control area. This one\
      \ is guarded by three Pupae - kill them, then activate the second pump wheel.\
      \ The ground rocks and you hear an explosion. Warning lights and alarms activate\
      \ above you. Looks like all hell has let loose...\n\nReturn through the control\
      \ room and approach the T-junction. Upon arrival, you will be charged by a Behemoth.\
      \ Kill the Behemoth then return from the junction to the balcony area above\
      \ the tank rooms. Drop off the balcony edge to the right such that you land\
      \ on the raised area of the first tank room.\n\nThe glass pipe to the sludge\
      \ tank has been smashed by the explosion, and you're going to take a swim. First,\
      \ though, heed the warnings of the panels and collect the Toxin Suit from the\
      \ alcove to the side - the glass winow has been removed. Now, drop to the floor\
      \ of the room and approach the pipe, then dive into the sludge.\n\nYou land\
      \ in a short submerged section of curving pipe. Follow it down and you emerge\
      \ in the sludge tank proper. In the tank, you can go in either direction to\
      \ your sides - go first to the left. Following the tank round a corner, you\
      \ will reach a dead end where you can collect a Super Health Pack from the floor.\
      \ Switch to your [[Combat Assault Rifle]], [[Stinger]], [[ASMD]] or another\
      \ good underwater weapon, then head back through the tank. Kill a [[Slith]]\
      \ that attacks you as you return to the main part of the tank. Remember that\
      \ the Toxin Suit will protect you from the Slith's saliva attack but not from\
      \ its claws - and that taking damage will compromise your Toxin Suit.\n\nWhen\
      \ the Slith is dead, proceed through the tank, collecting a Clip from the recess\
      \ opposite the pipe by which you entered. At the end of the tank, you will pass\
      \ through a sludge tunnel, shortly emerging in the other part of the tank beneath\
      \ the other room.\n\nThis part of the tank stretches on ahead. If you have taken\
      \ damage and your suit has been weakened, you might want to go through the pipe\
      \ on the right which leads out into the second tank room so that you can collect\
      \ the second Toxin Suit you saw earlier. When you're done, proceed through the\
      \ second part of the sludge tank. Turning round to the left at the corner ahead\
      \ and following the tank to the end, you can surface and climb out of the gunge\
      \ into a corridor.\n\nFollow this corridor loop round in either direction from\
      \ where you surfaced. At the other end, you will reach a doorway and a short\
      \ corridor that lead to an outdoor area where a LesserBrute snipes from a raised\
      \ balcony to the left. Kill the LesserBrute. This outdoor area has a central\
      \ passageway that leads to another door ahead, and there are ramps to either\
      \ side that lead up on to the raised balconies. Climb the ramps onto the raised\
      \ balcony to the right to find a UMS drop box that reveals a [[Rocket Launcher#Unreal:\
      \ RTNP|Rocket Launcher]].\n\nGo to the back end of this balcony. There's a hole\
      \ there down to a sludge tank. Toxin Suit permitting, drop down into the ankle-level\
      \ sludge. You are in one of four such small tanks connected by a ring of dry\
      \ tunnels. Go clockwise round the ring - the first two tunnels contain a 25kg\
      \ can of Tarydium Sludge each. The tanks themselves contain damaged lifts. The\
      \ third tank will contain a UMS drop box that reveals a [[Grenade Launcher]].\
      \ The fourth tank contains an undamaged lift - step on it and ride to the top\
      \ to emerge on the opposite balcony above.\n\nStep off the balcony and approach\
      \ the other entrance from this outdoor area. There, you can collect a GES [[Biorifle]]\
      \ and two further 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge. Proceed into the corridor from\
      \ the entrance here to collect an ASMD, but watch out as you do so because doors\
      \ open ahead to reveal a SkaarjWarrior right in your face.\n\nKill the Skaarj\
      \ and follow the corridor beyond. Curving round to the right, you emerge in\
      \ an outdoor area where a SkaarjLord ambushes you from the left. Back off and\
      \ kill the Skaarj, then return to the outdoor area and look around.\n\nYou are\
      \ on a walkway raised above the ground level below. Supports placed periodically\
      \ on either side hold the walkway in place. Go to the point ahead where the\
      \ walkway corners to the left, on the way visiting one of the supports on the\
      \ left for a [[can of 12 Eightballs]], and open a UMS drop box at the corner\
      \ for a pack of 10 Grenades. Then, drop off the walkway onto the ground area\
      \ below.\n\nExplore the ground area. It is an L-shaped piece of grass with metal\
      \ causeways around the edges. If you visit the corners at the far ends of the\
      \ area, you can collect a total of four ASMD Cores. You will also find a UMS\
      \ drop box that contains another pack of 10 Grenades. When you're done collecting\
      \ gear, go to the turning point of the L-shaped area. You will see a corridor\
      \ entrance; go inside and you will find that it leads to a lift.\n\nEnter the\
      \ corridor but don't go up the lift yet - you can hear Pupae hissing at the\
      \ top. So, lob a couple of Grenades up the lift shaft to dispose of them. Then,\
      \ step aboard the lift and ride it to the low corridor at the top. Collect the\
      \ Health Pack there then follow the corridor round to the right. A wall will\
      \ open and you can descend one of the supports back on to the raised walkway.\n\
      \nFollow the walkway now towards the door at the far end. Visit an intermediate\
      \ support on the right for a Health Pack. When you reach the far end, visit\
      \ the supports to either side for two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Open the door\
      \ at this end of the walkway. Kill a SkaarjAssassin that ambushes you from beyond.\
      \ Entering, follow the corridor inside round to the right and kill the two Pupae\
      \ that crawl out from a recess on the right. Then, go to the end of the corridor\
      \ and through the doors there to arrive in a large room.\n\nThis room is some\
      \ kind of hangar. There are some large garage-type doors on the left and a large\
      \ crane mounted on roof beams. First things first, you will probably hear something\
      \ coming through doors behind you, so go back out into the corridor and dispose\
      \ of the incoming SkaarjWarrior.\n\nReturn to the hangar. You are on a slightly\
      \ raised balcony. Step forwards on to some boxes for two ASMD Cores. Then, go\
      \ to the far end of the room. On the way check the huge door - it is locked.\
      \ At the far end of the room go beneath the balcony for an Assault Vest. There\
      \ are steps back up to the balcony here, so go up them and collect the replacement\
      \ Toxin Suit from on top. Follow the balcony to the left, going via a Health\
      \ Pack on a box nearby if you need to, and approach the large lever at the end\
      \ with a picture of the crane above it. The lever does not activate - you get\
      \ this message [3].\n\nDrop back down to the floor of the hangar and look to\
      \ the right of the balcony steps. A ramp slopes down to a corridor full of sludge.\
      \ Ahead at the far end you will see a room with a control wheel.\n\nFirst, submerge\
      \ and go down into the tank beneath the room with the control wheel. You are\
      \ in a tank with barred entrances through to another tank - the bars are locked,\
      \ but you can take this opportunity to safely dispose of a Slith beyond. Return\
      \ to the corridor and surface, climbing out into the room with the control wheel.\
      \ Look to either side - you can collect two ASMD Cores from near two sets of\
      \ small sealed doors. Activate the control wheel and the sealed doors open;\
      \ go through the ones to the right and collect the Health Pack beyond, but watch\
      \ out for a Slith in the room to the left.\n\nThe doors have sealed again behind\
      \ you, so go on into the room. There, you will find a red button on the left\
      \ wall beneath a panel with a picture of the crane on it. Press the button.\
      \ Now, if you continue on round to the left, you can collect a Health Pack but\
      \ you are just back at the other sealed doors and they won't open. So, return\
      \ to the area by the control button and drop through a hole in the floor there\
      \ into a sludge tank below.\n\nThis tank is the one you saw barred off just\
      \ now. Approach one of the sets of bars and it opens, allowing you to pass through.\
      \ Return through the sludge to the ramp up to the hangar. Climb back out into\
      \ the hangar, but beware two Pupae which drop off the balcony from behind.\n\
      \nUse the steps to climb back onto the balcony. The crane controls should be\
      \ active now, so go along the balcony and press the lever. The crane swings\
      \ into action, swivelling around the room and smashing into the huge garage-type\
      \ door.\n\nWith explosions, part of the door smashes open. Drop to the floor\
      \ and go through the gap into the room beyond - beware a Pupa that attacks from\
      \ ahead. Go into the room and round the next corner - you'll have to kill a\
      \ SkaarjAssassin and another Pupa, so be ready. Further into the room is a door\
      \ on the left which is locked. Continue round the room. Shortly you'll reach\
      \ steps onto the raised area to the right. If you're short of Eightballs, go\
      \ up onto that balcony and follow it right round to its end, where you can open\
      \ wooden crates for a can of 12.\n\nContinue round to the end of the room. Turning\
      \ left, you'll emerge in a large room with a huge raised storage tank in the\
      \ middle. There's a balcony above you. Look up and around until you see a Behemoth\
      \ on patrol. Kill it while you have the element of surprise.\n\nGo to the far\
      \ end of this large room. Ahead to the left is a doorway into a corridor. As\
      \ you reach the end of the huge tank on the right, two Pupae attack from beyond\
      \ some control panels. Kill them. Then, go to the right past the control panels.\
      \ You'll find a lift in the corner onto the balcony the Behemoth was patrolling.\
      \ Ride it up and look at the tank from above - it is sealed shut. Follow the\
      \ balcony right round the room. At the corners you'll find two Health Packs,\
      \ and at the far end wooden crates reveal an [[Eightball Gun]] and two cans\
      \ of 12 Eightballs.\n\nDrop back down at this end of the room. Go through the\
      \ corridor entrance you saw before. Following the corridor clockwise, a SkaarjAssassin\
      \ attacks out of an alcove to the right which also contains a Toxin Suit. Kill\
      \ it but don't collect the Toxin Suit yet.\n\nGo on round the corridor. In the\
      \ next straight stretch, a Pupa attacks from behind conduits to the left. Kill\
      \ the Pupa, then go between the two verticals and round behind for two 25kg\
      \ cans of Tarydium Sludge.\n\nGo along the corridor. At the end, press a large\
      \ red button on the right to call a lift ahead. As the lift descends, kill the\
      \ SkaarjWarrior that comes down with it. Step aboard and ride the lift up -\
      \ if necessary, call it again. At the top, turn off to the right and enter the\
      \ control room there with a view of the huge storage tank.\n\nCollect the two\
      \ boxes of Flak Shells you find to either side in the control room, then press\
      \ the lever ahead. Look through one of the viewing windows ahead, and you will\
      \ see the large storage tank open.\n\nReturn to the lift and press the large\
      \ red button there to descend. Step off and follow the corridor back round to\
      \ the tank room, collecting that Toxin Suit on the way. Go across the end of\
      \ the tank room past the panels, and ride the lift onto the balcony again. Select\
      \ a good underwater weapon (CAR, ASMD, [[Minigun]], Stinger etc.) and jump across\
      \ to the tank. Plunge in - immediately you will have to deal with a Slith -\
      \ don't let it destroy your Toxin Suit, or you're scuppered.\n\nLook at either\
      \ end in the tank. At one end is a can of 12 Eightballs - collect the ammo.\
      \ At the other end is a pipe - enter it. It leads you downwards, and you emerge\
      \ at the other end in a large tank of sludge beneath the main room above. Kill\
      \ a Slith lurking here with your ASMD. Go first to the right. At the end, you'll\
      \ reach an extension of the tank to the left. Eliminate a Slith that comes from\
      \ the far end, then go down to the end yourself to get an Energy Amplifier plus\
      \ two Clips on top of a support. Return to the main tank and go through it to\
      \ the other end. Collect an ASMD Core from the centre of the floor on the way.\
      \ At the end, head off to the right down an extension of the tank there. Collect\
      \ an ASMD Core from the floor by a low entrance to the left and destroy a Slith\
      \ that sights you from down the tunnel there. Go through the tunnel beyond the\
      \ entrance and collect another ASMD Core from the floor at the far end.\n\n\
      Stay facing in that direction and surface. You will come out at the end of a\
      \ shallow pool of sludge. Head immediately across it and climb the ramp at the\
      \ far end of it onto a raised walkway, because a SkaarjAssassin has seen you\
      \ and launched an attack - and you don't want to be caught in the Sludge without\
      \ a suit.\n\nIf you still have your suit when the Skaarj is dead, there's a\
      \ Health Pack in the shallow pool between balcony supports to one side. When\
      \ you've collected the pack, climb out again and follow the balcony round to\
      \ the left. You'll reach a door and a button. Press the button to open the door,\
      \ which leads back out to the room beyond the hangar should you wish to backtrack\
      \ at all. You however probably don't, so go back out onto the balcony.\n\nPressing\
      \ the button has also opened alcoves further round the balcony. The alcoves\
      \ contain wooden crates - shoot them open to reveal an ASMD Core and a useful\
      \ [[Shield Belt]]. Collect, then go on round the balcony past the ramp out of\
      \ the sludge. You'll enter a short curving corridor. Follow the curving corridor\
      \ round to the right. You'll enter the next room and there will be the sound\
      \ of an explosion from somewhere as a SkaarjAssassin drops down from a hole\
      \ in the ceiling. Kill the Skaarj and enter the room a bit further. Ventilation\
      \ grilles at ground level burst open and two Pupae will attack - kill them both.\n\
      \nGo across the room. You'll cross a metal panel in the floor as you approach\
      \ a lift at the back. Reaching the lift, it descends and you can step aboard\
      \ to ride it to a raised balcony at the back. Open a wooden crate on the lift\
      \ for a Health Pack.\n\nAt the top of the lift you are on the balcony. Go to\
      \ the right to find wooden crates that reveal two ASMD Cores, then turn round\
      \ and go to the other end of the balcony to enter a corridor there. Following\
      \ the corridor round an anticlockwise curve, you'll reach a small control room.\
      \ Press a lever here - you'll also get the following message [4].\n\nOnce you\
      \ have pressed the lever, return along the corridor. Expect to be met outside\
      \ by a SkaarjWarrior. Kill the Skaarj, then look down at the main floor of the\
      \ room. You'll see that the floor panel has been removed. Drop to the floor\
      \ and look down the hole.\n\nThe hole is a shaft down to a lift at the bottom.\
      \ Drop down and land on the lift, which spins you rapidly back up into the room\
      \ above, then up through a hole in the ceiling, shortly arriving in a corridor\
      \ T-junction. There are three ways you can go from here. The corridor heads\
      \ off in either direction. The third goes to an outdoor area - take this route\
      \ now, but expect to be attacked from the right by a SkaarjAssassin.\n\nThis\
      \ outdoor area is some kind of dock, with a small control building in the centre.\
      \ There's a Skaarj skimmer shuttle here, but it is inoperative. Head along to\
      \ the left; you'll find an UMS drop box that reveals a [[Rocket Pack#Unreal:\
      \ RTNP|pack of 10 Rockets]]. You'll also be able to look down on to the L-shaped\
      \ outdoor area from earlier - don't fall in! Here, you can cross one of the\
      \ support gantries over the gap for a box of 10 Flak Shells.\n\nContinue clockwise\
      \ round the outdoor area. Jumping over at the next corner, you can go for another\
      \ UMS drop box that reveals two 50 bullet CAR Clips and a Combat Assault Rifle.\
      \ A support gantry in this vicinity carries a Health Pack. Go on round and cross\
      \ the last support gantry for a box of 10 Flak Shells, thereby arriving near\
      \ the entrance to the control building. Kill a Pupa lurking inside, then open\
      \ wooden crates to reveal an ASMD Core, a box of 10 Flak Shells and another\
      \ Pupa. Nothing else that you can do out here after that, so return to the corridor\
      \ entrance and the T-junction.\n\nFrom here, the corridor leads off to the left\
      \ and right. There are also viewing holes ahead down to the room with the balcony\
      \ below. One of them contains a Health Pack. Both holes have below them ASMD\
      \ Cores placed on roof beams if you need them, but if you'll get them you'll\
      \ have to coma back up via the spinning lift.\n\nTake either of the corridors\
      \ from the T-junction - one of them has a Pupa behind a crate, the other has\
      \ two, but both lead to the same place. You'll be taken round a curve to a room\
      \ at the back with a transport cart at the centre.\n\nA SkaarjAssassin guards\
      \ this room - kill it. Before stepping on the cart, two ASMD Cores raised on\
      \ boxes in this room can be collected by jumping via a pipe at the back. Shoot\
      \ the wooden crate on the cart open for a box of 10 Flak Shells, then step aboard\
      \ and collect the ammo. The cart will take you down a sloping tunnel, before\
      \ emerging in a room at the bottom where you will be attacked from the left\
      \ by a Pupa and from above or behind by a SkaarjAssassin.\n\nLook around the\
      \ room. To the left is a door which is locked. To the right, a doorway leads\
      \ into a corridor. Boxes here have on top of them a Super Health pack and, over\
      \ the other side of the room, a box of 10 Flak Shells, but you can't reach them\
      \ from here, so head off through the open door to your right and enter the corridor.\n\
      \nAs you follow the corridor, you will pass a switch bank on the left. Press\
      \ a lever there and go on round the corridor - you have called a lift at the\
      \ far end on which there is a LesserBrute. Kill the LesserBrute then ride the\
      \ lift as it goes back up. You emerge on a balcony above the room. A crane ahead\
      \ is controlled by a lever on the left. Ignore that for now and go to the edge\
      \ and look down. You can just see the edge of the boxes carrying the Super Health\
      \ Pack. With a little bit of nifty control, you can drop down on to the boxes\
      \ and grab the pack.\n\nGo back round the corridor and activate the lift again,\
      \ returning to the balcony. Press the lever on the left this time, and watch\
      \ as the crane swivels across from a balcony on the far side of the room. When\
      \ the crane reaches your balcony, jump up onto its lower ring and ride it as\
      \ it swivels back across the room to a similar balcony on the far side.\n\n\
      There's a switch on this balcony and also two wooden crates. Destroy the crates\
      \ for a Health Pack and an Assault Vest, then press the switch. The locked door\
      \ on the floor below opens to reveal a corridor. There's a Skaarj in the corridor\
      \ - snipe it, then drop down to the floor via the box of 10 Flak Shells on the\
      \ box below.\n\nEnter the corridor and follow it round. As you reach the end,\
      \ the ground turns into a lift which takes you slowly down. Stepping off to\
      \ the right at the bottom, you will be in a large dark tunnel lit only by emergency\
      \ beacons. Go along this tunnel, collecting a box of 10 Flak Shells on the way,\
      \ until you descend another lift at the end. You will be taken down further\
      \ into a similar tunnel where you can collect a can of 12 Eightballs. Follow\
      \ this tunnel to the end and descend another lift. You will arrive in a foggy,\
      \ fume-filled room with a hole in the centre of the floor. Prepare yourself\
      \ for a fight, because as you approach the hole, a lift rises up it bringing\
      \ with it a gigantic mutant SkaarjLord. Take it down as best you can - try not\
      \ to take too much damage.\n\nWhen the creature is dead, the lift descends,\
      \ revealing a dank tunnel at the bottom shallowly filled with sludge. Follow\
      \ the tunnel. It winds round several times, until you reach a room full of sludge\
      \ waterfalls. There, climb on to a lift in the centre and ride it up to the\
      \ top to exit the level.\n\n== Translator messages ==\n#\"Warning: Simultaneous\
