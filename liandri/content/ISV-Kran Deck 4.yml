      \ walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n</p><p>Now, you are within the\
      \ large crashed Earth ship. As you enter via the loading bay you find that this\
      \ is no safe haven. The crew are dead, and the ship has the worst infestation\
      \ of <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> that you have seen yet.\n\
      </p><p>You start in the corridor from the docking bay. Go to the dead crew member\
      \ to the right and read his log [1].\n</p><p>Well, that's your brief for the\
      \ following three maps, so go through the doors ahead into the aft loading bay.\n\
      </p><p>You are in an area with crates of equipment on either side, a balcony\
      \ above, and a control panel ahead. Go first to the crates on the right and\
      \ collect the stuff lying on top; a can of 12 Eightballs and three clusters\
      \ of 40 Tarydium Shards. Then, drop to the floor and collect the two Health\
      \ Packs and <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> from a dead crew\
      \ member nearby. This corpse also has a log [2].\n</p><p>If you go near the\
      \ ventilation grating on this side of the loading bay it will open, but ignore\
      \ it and go across to the other side of the loading bay. There is another can\
      \ of 12 Eightballs on top of the crates here, and from the crates you can jump\
      \ to 12 more Eightballs and a <a href=\"/Toxin_Suit\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Toxin Suit\">Toxin Suit</a> on a ledge. Collect the Eightballs but\
      \ DON'T collect the Toxin Suit yet as you will want it later.\n</p><p>In this\
      \ alcove there is another small information panel. Read the entry [3].\n</p><p>Collect\
      \ of the can of 12 Eightballs and 40 Tarydium Shards amongst the crates on this\
      \ side of the loading bay then open the ventilation grate here and go through\
      \ to the far end of the shaft, where there is another grate. This grate doesn't\
      \ open, but you can collect a Stinger and a box of 50 Bullets, then read the\
      \ log of the human corpse here [4].\n</p><p>Return to the aft loading bay and\
      \ approach the large control panel. Go round behind it, and collect of the two\
      \ Health Packs and <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball\
      \ Gun</a> here. Then, return to the front and operate the panel. A lift descends\
      \ behind you; step on to it and it will rise to the raised walkway. Go along\
      \ the walkway to the T-junction at the end, where a large overhead panel carries\
      \ a warning message [5].\n</p><p>At the T-junction, a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScout</a> in the corridor to the right will\
      \ see you and run off. Follow it and you will see it set off an alarm. Kill\
      \ the Skaarj then read the panel it operated [6].\n</p><p>Ahead the exit from\
      \ this section is blocked with a security lockout (details are on a panel) [7].\n\
      </p><p>With the death of the Skaarj that operated the alarm, you are now blocked\
      \ into the area as six SkaarjScouts drop one by one out of the ceiling ventilation\
      \ ducts. You are in for a tough fight, so circulate round the corridors here\
      \ as you shoot to collect aid in the form of 5 Health Packs, 2 cans of 12 Eightballs\
      \ and an <a href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a>\
      \ that are scattered through the corridors. When all of the Skaarj are finally\
      \ dead, a floor grate opens up in the central junction of the corridors.\n</p><p>Approach\
      \ the revealed duct in the floor; you will see an unpleasant spinning fan at\
      \ the bottom, which when you drop down, you will have to make sure that you\
      \ avoid by landing on the protrusions beneath an opening in the vertical wall.\
      \ BUT DON'T DROP DOWN YET; first go back to the aft loading bay and collect\
      \ that Toxin Suit you left before.\n</p><p>Return to the hole and drop down\
      \ into the opening below to access a horizontal duct. Go round the corner, and\
      \ you will find a dead <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"Skaarj\
      \ Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a> with a <a href=\"/Ripper\" title=\"Ripper\">Razorjack</a>\
      \ weapon. Collect the Razorjack then continue along the duct, and ride the lift\
      \ at the end up into the next section of ductway, where there is another dead\
      \ SkaarjWarrior, this time with two boxes of Razor Blades.\nContinue following\
      \ the duct, avoiding the openings back down to the main Deck 4 corridors, until\
      \ you reach a blue-lit opening overlooking some raised walkways with green engine\
      \ coolant down underneath.\n</p><p>There is a small information panel on the\
      \ wall here [8].\n</p><p>There are two levels of walkway here; drop on to the\
      \ upper one, a short stretch of metal walkway between a control panel and a\
      \ fan behind a grate. Read and operate the panel [9].\n</p><p>Turn round and\
      \ face the fan. Shoot the light fitting on the wall above and the fan grate\
      \ opens; avoid the fan itself but collect the <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"\
      Shock Rifle\">ASMD</a> from within the opening.\n</p><p>Now, look down towards\
      \ the coolant. Normally the coolant would kill you, but you are wearing a Toxin\
      \ Suit, so jump straight in. Swim down to the deepest part of the pool and shoot\
      \ wooden crates open here to get an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a> and a <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"\
      Flashlight\">Flashlight</a>.\n</p><p>Climb out of the gunge and on to the lower\
      \ of the two walkways. Go to the ventilation grilles - the first one will open\
      \ gibbing the corpse of the unfortunate Corporal Anders Kerig beyond - and follow\
      \ the duct, emerging at the other end back into the aft loading station. Press\
      \ the panel again and ride the lift once more then follow the corridors beyond\
      \ (don't fall back down into the ducting or on to that fan!) and go to the door\
      \ that was locked previously. It is open now.\n</p><p>The door has revealed\
      \ a warehouse entrance. The message on the panel has changed [10].\n</p><p>Enter\
      \ and go behind the open crate to the right to grab a box of 50 Bullets. Then,\
      \ go along to the left and left again into a small alcove area where three Health\
      \ Packs are spilling out of an open crate.\n</p><p>Go back and along, into the\
      \ main body of the warehouse, which is a tall room stacked high with crates.\
      \ Go through and emerge into a more open area in the warehouse, where a dozing\
      \ SkaarjScout wakes up and attacks from the right. Kill it.\n</p><p>Go now to\
      \ the right and follow a short corridor to a small armoury where there are two\
      \ cans of 12 Eightballs, a <a href=\"/Bio_Rifle\" title=\"Bio Rifle\">GES Biorifle</a>,\
      \ and two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge. Collect, then return to the warehouse\
      \ and cross to the far side where bars block a large door with a panel nearby\
      \ [11].\n</p><p>Look down behind crates to the left and you will see a lift\
      \ that you haven't used yet. Press the button to call it then ride it up to\
      \ a control room with unbreakable windows overlooking the warehouse. Kill the\
      \ SkaarjScout that is operating a control panel, then operate the panel yourself;\
      \ a large ramp descends from an upper level into the main warehouse.\n</p><p>Stop\
      \ by to collect a Clip and a Health Pack from behind crates here, then return\
      \ to the warehouse and climb the ramp. As you climb, with a bit of clever crate-hopping,\
      \ you can get hold of a Health Pack and two ASMD Cores.\n</p><p>Enter the upper\
      \ warehouse loft. There are numerous items here; three Health Packs behind crates\
      \ on your absolute right, two Health Packs and two Clips in the vicinity of\
      \ a panel in the right corner, an Assault Vest in the left corner, plus two\
      \ Health Packs and a box of 50 Bullets in an open duct behind and to the left.\
      \ You'll need these, because as you enter the area you will be shut into this\
      \ confined space as three SkaarjScouts take it in turns to drop in through the\
      \ ceiling ducts.\nWhen the Skaarj are dead, operate the panel [12].\n</p><p>The\
      \ exit is open now, so descend the ramp and go through the previously barred\
      \ doorway. Press a button within to open the huge doors ahead, then go through\
      \ to exit the level.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ the fifteenth map in [[Unreal|Unreal's]] single player game.\n; Author : [[Myscha\
      \ the Sled Dog]]\n; Description\n: The aft loading bay of the ISV-Kran is eerily\
      \ quiet, but the bloodied corpses of the ship's remaining crew members show\
      \ that all is not well. Salvaging the dead men's ammo, the player realises that\
      \ he will find no safe haven aboard the crashed Terran vessel.\n{{clear}}\n\

      ==Walkthrough==\n''This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature\
      \ and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\nNow, you\
      \ are within the large crashed Earth ship. As you enter via the loading bay\
      \ you find that this is no safe haven. The crew are dead, and the ship has the\
      \ worst infestation of [[Skaarj]] that you have seen yet.\n\nYou start in the\
      \ corridor from the docking bay. Go to the dead crew member to the right and\
      \ read his log [1].\n\nWell, that's your brief for the following three maps,\
      \ so go through the doors ahead into the aft loading bay.\n\nYou are in an area\
      \ with crates of equipment on either side, a balcony above, and a control panel\
      \ ahead. Go first to the crates on the right and collect the stuff lying on\
      \ top; a can of 12 Eightballs and three clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards. Then,\
      \ drop to the floor and collect the two Health Packs and [[Stinger]] from a\
      \ dead crew member nearby. This corpse also has a log [2].\n\nIf you go near\
      \ the ventilation grating on this side of the loading bay it will open, but\
      \ ignore it and go across to the other side of the loading bay. There is another\
      \ can of 12 Eightballs on top of the crates here, and from the crates you can\
      \ jump to 12 more Eightballs and a [[Toxin Suit]] on a ledge. Collect the Eightballs\
      \ but DON'T collect the Toxin Suit yet as you will want it later.\n\nIn this\
      \ alcove there is another small information panel. Read the entry [3].\n\nCollect\
      \ of the can of 12 Eightballs and 40 Tarydium Shards amongst the crates on this\
      \ side of the loading bay then open the ventilation grate here and go through\
      \ to the far end of the shaft, where there is another grate. This grate doesn't\
      \ open, but you can collect a Stinger and a box of 50 Bullets, then read the\
      \ log of the human corpse here [4].\n\nReturn to the aft loading bay and approach\
      \ the large control panel. Go round behind it, and collect of the two Health\
      \ Packs and [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Gun]] here. Then, return to the front\
      \ and operate the panel. A lift descends behind you; step on to it and it will\
      \ rise to the raised walkway. Go along the walkway to the T-junction at the\
      \ end, where a large overhead panel carries a warning message [5].\n\nAt the\
      \ T-junction, a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScout]] in the corridor\
      \ to the right will see you and run off. Follow it and you will see it set off\
      \ an alarm. Kill the Skaarj then read the panel it operated [6].\n\nAhead the\
      \ exit from this section is blocked with a security lockout (details are on\
      \ a panel) [7].\n\nWith the death of the Skaarj that operated the alarm, you\
      \ are now blocked into the area as six SkaarjScouts drop one by one out of the\
      \ ceiling ventilation ducts. You are in for a tough fight, so circulate round\
      \ the corridors here as you shoot to collect aid in the form of 5 Health Packs,\
      \ 2 cans of 12 Eightballs and an [[Automag]] that are scattered through the\
      \ corridors. When all of the Skaarj are finally dead, a floor grate opens up\
      \ in the central junction of the corridors.\n\nApproach the revealed duct in\
      \ the floor; you will see an unpleasant spinning fan at the bottom, which when\
      \ you drop down, you will have to make sure that you avoid by landing on the\
      \ protrusions beneath an opening in the vertical wall. BUT DON'T DROP DOWN YET;\
      \ first go back to the aft loading bay and collect that Toxin Suit you left\
      \ before.\n\nReturn to the hole and drop down into the opening below to access\
      \ a horizontal duct. Go round the corner, and you will find a dead [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]]\
      \ with a [[Ripper|Razorjack]] weapon. Collect the Razorjack then continue along\
      \ the duct, and ride the lift at the end up into the next section of ductway,\
      \ where there is another dead SkaarjWarrior, this time with two boxes of Razor\
      \ Blades.\nContinue following the duct, avoiding the openings back down to the\
      \ main Deck 4 corridors, until you reach a blue-lit opening overlooking some\
      \ raised walkways with green engine coolant down underneath.\n\nThere is a small\
      \ information panel on the wall here [8].\n\nThere are two levels of walkway\
      \ here; drop on to the upper one, a short stretch of metal walkway between a\
      \ control panel and a fan behind a grate. Read and operate the panel [9].\n\n\
      Turn round and face the fan. Shoot the light fitting on the wall above and the\
      \ fan grate opens; avoid the fan itself but collect the [[Shock Rifle|ASMD]]\
      \ from within the opening.\n\nNow, look down towards the coolant. Normally the\
      \ coolant would kill you, but you are wearing a Toxin Suit, so jump straight\
      \ in. Swim down to the deepest part of the pool and shoot wooden crates open\
      \ here to get an [[Assault Vest]] and a [[Flashlight]].\n\nClimb out of the\
      \ gunge and on to the lower of the two walkways. Go to the ventilation grilles\
      \ - the first one will open gibbing the corpse of the unfortunate Corporal Anders\
      \ Kerig beyond - and follow the duct, emerging at the other end back into the\
      \ aft loading station. Press the panel again and ride the lift once more then\
      \ follow the corridors beyond (don't fall back down into the ducting or on to\
      \ that fan!) and go to the door that was locked previously. It is open now.\n\
      \nThe door has revealed a warehouse entrance. The message on the panel has changed\
      \ [10].\n\nEnter and go behind the open crate to the right to grab a box of\
      \ 50 Bullets. Then, go along to the left and left again into a small alcove\
      \ area where three Health Packs are spilling out of an open crate.\n\nGo back\
      \ and along, into the main body of the warehouse, which is a tall room stacked\
      \ high with crates. Go through and emerge into a more open area in the warehouse,\
      \ where a dozing SkaarjScout wakes up and attacks from the right. Kill it.\n\
      \nGo now to the right and follow a short corridor to a small armoury where there\
      \ are two cans of 12 Eightballs, a [[Bio Rifle|GES Biorifle]], and two 25kg\
      \ cans of Tarydium Sludge. Collect, then return to the warehouse and cross to\
      \ the far side where bars block a large door with a panel nearby [11].\n\nLook\
      \ down behind crates to the left and you will see a lift that you haven't used\
      \ yet. Press the button to call it then ride it up to a control room with unbreakable\
      \ windows overlooking the warehouse. Kill the SkaarjScout that is operating\
      \ a control panel, then operate the panel yourself; a large ramp descends from\
      \ an upper level into the main warehouse.\n\nStop by to collect a Clip and a\
      \ Health Pack from behind crates here, then return to the warehouse and climb\
      \ the ramp. As you climb, with a bit of clever crate-hopping, you can get hold\
      \ of a Health Pack and two ASMD Cores.\n\nEnter the upper warehouse loft. There\
      \ are numerous items here; three Health Packs behind crates on your absolute\
      \ right, two Health Packs and two Clips in the vicinity of a panel in the right\
      \ corner, an Assault Vest in the left corner, plus two Health Packs and a box\
      \ of 50 Bullets in an open duct behind and to the left. You'll need these, because\
      \ as you enter the area you will be shut into this confined space as three SkaarjScouts\
      \ take it in turns to drop in through the ceiling ducts.\nWhen the Skaarj are\
      \ dead, operate the panel [12].\n\nThe exit is open now, so descend the ramp\
      \ and go through the previously barred doorway. Press a button within to open\
      \ the huge doors ahead, then go through to exit the level.\n\n\n==Translator\
