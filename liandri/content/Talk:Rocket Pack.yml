      <p>I also don't see much of a purpose to having separate ammo pages for each\
      \ ammo type. The only useful thing you could add is images of the ammo.  I'm\
      \ also not sure what the point of this redirect from <a href=\"/Can_of_12_Eightballs\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Can of 12 Eightballs\">Can of 12 Eightballs</a>\
      \ is. It would be simpler and more clear if \"Eightball\" simply linked back\
      \ to <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a>.\
      \ Someone coming to the site isn't likely to search for \"can of 12 eightballs\"\
      \ as opposed to \"eightball\". IMO if you want to add ammo images, you should\
      \ take better pictures of the weapons that include an image of the ammo pack,\
      \ like <a href=\"/File:Rocketlauncher-2003.jpg\" title=\"File:Rocketlauncher-2003.jpg\"\
      >Image:Rocketlauncher-2003.jpg</a>. There really is no other useful thing you\
      \ could add to this page. --<a href=\"/User:Sir_Brizz\" title=\"User:Sir Brizz\"\

      \ going to add the images... While the can of 12 eightballs redirect is not\
      \ for searching, it's for walkthroughs as it is usually used there and it's\
      \ simplier to add [[Can of 12 Eightballs]] than [[Rocket Pack#Unreal|Can of\
      \ 12 Eightballs]]. And a redirect in the Eightball is already there. I mean,\
      \ why does it matter if there's a page of ammo types? Just let it stay, it doesn't\
      \ do any harm. --<a href=\"/User:GreatEmerald\" title=\"User:GreatEmerald\"\
      >GreatEmerald</a> 15:10, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n<dl><dd>Mainly because the information\

      \  The only extra information supplied here is an exhaustive description of\

      \ Launcher - not necessarily people who want to have info about the Rocket Launcher\
      \ wants to know in-depth about the Rocket Pack. And if they want to, then each\

      \ of a rocket pack does. What are you thinking a person could possibly get from\
      \ this page? That's what I would honestly like to know. An image of the ammo\
      \ and a short sentance on the weapon page could accomplish the same thing...\

      \ as we can. The places Rocket Packs are found is quite useful information,\
      \ as well as the amount of them needed to get the full backpack of rockets.\
      \ And if we merged it with Rocket Launcher, it would be hard to make sure the\
      \ user looks at the correct Rocket Pack description, as all the Rocket Packs\
      \ are simply called Rocket Packs, while now it's only a matter of linking to\
      \ Rocket Pack#Game. --<a href=\"/User:GreatEmerald\" title=\"User:GreatEmerald\"\

      \ I used as template for adding the weapon and powerup information. At the time\

      \ in maps anyway. Regarding this page I think it's actually quite nice to see\
      \ the development of the rocketpack, but maybe it fits better in an article\
      \ style then as loose descriptions for each game. For the links from map pages\
      \ I think the info at the weapons could do well if the ammo pack is included\
      \ in the picture. Things like the animated pack of 12 eightballs could be added\
      \ to the rocket launcher description (and an open and closed can on the image).\

    text: "I'm not sure this merits it's own page.  The information is good, but I'd\
      \ say it should be part of the [[Rocket Launcher]] page instead. – [[User:Haarg|Haarg]]\
      \ 11:04, 15 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n:I'd have to agree with the above. [[User:Retodon8|Retodon8]]\
      \ 13:26, 15 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n:Disagree. 17+ links here, plus informative.\
      \ Enough info to make a new page. All maps link to ammo there is on the map,\
      \ as well as walkthroughs. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 14:04, 15 April\
      \ 2008 (EDT)\n::There may be 17+ links, but they all come from map pages. I\
      \ recommend redirecting specific ammo pages either to a general ammo page or\
      \ to the corresponding weapon page. I mean, what great strategical or otherwise\
      \ interesting things can you say about a rocket pack pickup? -[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]]\
      \ 04:27, 16 April 2008 (EDT)\n:::It could be a general ammo page, but that would\
      \ be huge. I have something to say about Rocket Packs, really. You can see that\
      \ in the article :) Plus images, I'll upload them some time. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 07:36, 16 April 2008 (EDT)\n:::Though I think that it should stay, if it really\
      \ needs to go somewhere, I would rather see it as subsections in the RL page.\
      \ --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 13:46, 16 April 2008 (EDT)\n::::Thing\
      \ is, then we have to do ammo pages for every weapon. And it's hardly worth\
      \ knowing the subtle nuances of the ammo per-game. --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark\
      \ Pulse]] 16:06, 17 April 2008 (EDT)\n:::::We? :) I'm going to create most of\
      \ them, that's not hard. And I think it is useful, really. There should be articles\
      \ about quite everything, not just limited to maps, weapons etc. I see nothing\
      \ bad in having pages for ammo pickups. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 16:26, 17 April 2008 (EDT)\n::::::From a gameplay perspective, it's fairly\
      \ redundant. Everyone knows what ammo does, and the pickup amount is listed\
      \ with the weapon in each respective game. --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark Pulse]]\
      \ 19:07, 17 April 2008 (EDT)\n:::::::Not everyone actually. If someone plays\
      \ only UT2004 and hears someone saying \"you need to pick up the eightball pack\"\
      \ he surely won't have an idea what that is. And look from the wiki perspective\
      \ instead :) --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 06:43, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n\
      ::::::::Except there's no eightball packs in UT2004. A person will say \"Rocket\
      \ Ammo.\" :p --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark Pulse]] 15:09, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n:::::::::Dark,\
      \ I mean if Unreal 1 players tells the UT2004 player to do so... --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 06:57, 19 April 2008 (EDT)\n\nI also don't see much of a purpose to having\
      \ separate ammo pages for each ammo type. The only useful thing you could add\
      \ is images of the ammo.  I'm also not sure what the point of this redirect\
      \ from [[Can of 12 Eightballs]] is. It would be simpler and more clear if \"\
      Eightball\" simply linked back to [[Rocket Launcher]]. Someone coming to the\
      \ site isn't likely to search for \"can of 12 eightballs\" as opposed to \"\
      eightball\". IMO if you want to add ammo images, you should take better pictures\
      \ of the weapons that include an image of the ammo pack, like [[:Image:Rocketlauncher-2003.jpg]].\
      \ There really is no other useful thing you could add to this page. --[[User:Sir\
      \ Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 10:24, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n:I already said I'm going\
      \ to add the images... While the can of 12 eightballs redirect is not for searching,\
      \ it's for walkthroughs as it is usually used there and it's simplier to add\
      \ <nowiki>[[Can of 12 Eightballs]] than [[Rocket Pack#Unreal|Can of 12 Eightballs]]</nowiki>.\
      \ And a redirect in the Eightball is already there. I mean, why does it matter\
      \ if there's a page of ammo types? Just let it stay, it doesn't do any harm.\
      \ --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 15:10, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n::Mainly\
      \ because the information is of some value, but that is mostly lost when it\
      \ is separated from the weapon.  The only extra information supplied here is\
      \ an exhaustive description of the model and a listing of the amount of ammo\
      \ supplied.  Model descriptions would be better off as pictures anyway IMO.\
      \ – [[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 15:45, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n:::Mainly for me it's\
      \ a question of what value is actually added by the page. What can you tell\
      \ me on the ammo page that would be of such length that it could not be said\
      \ on the weapon specific page? The ammo pack ammo amounts are already listed\
      \ on the weapon page and if pictures were included there, then there wouldn't\
      \ be any new or different information on this page. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]]\
      \ 02:38, 19 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n\n\nI'm still not sold on this page. What value\
      \ is it actually adding that could not be on the main rocket page in less words?\
      \ --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 12:23, 3 May 2008 (EDT)\n:Images that won't\
      \ fit there and descriptions that are not for Rocket Launcher, but for the Rocket\
      \ Pack. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 13:34, 3 May 2008 (EDT)\n::Pictures\
      \ of the ammo would certainly belong on the main page. Just look at the images\
      \ you are using that came from that page. They include the rocket images. Descriptions\
      \ of the ammo pack would fit there, too. I simply don't see anything on this\
      \ page that couldn't be put into one or two sentences per game iteration on\
      \ the weapon page. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 17:39, 3 May 2008 (EDT)\n\
      :::But if the user wants to read about the Rocket Pack, it doesn't mean he does\
      \ want to read about the Rocket Launcher - after all, he clicked on the words\
      \ \"Rocket Pack\". Same way to the Rocket Launcher - not necessarily people\
      \ who want to have info about the Rocket Launcher wants to know in-depth about\
      \ the Rocket Pack. And if they want to, then each section is linked to the Rocket\
      \ Launcher or Rocket Pack articles. (RL isn't all linked yet though) --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 18:19, 3 May 2008 (EDT)\n::::The point is that there is nothing useful on\
      \ this page, really. A person clicking on Rocket Pack is more likely looking\
      \ for information on using a rocket pack than what the animation of a rocket\
      \ pack does. What are you thinking a person could possibly get from this page?\
      \ That's what I would honestly like to know. An image of the ammo and a short\
      \ sentance on the weapon page could accomplish the same thing... --[[User:Sir\
      \ Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 23:53, 3 May 2008 (EDT)\n:::::There's no way to ''use''\
      \ a Rocket Pack :D You either pick it up or not. Or get near enough to see it\
      \ animating, if it's Unreal 1. And it's good for organising, we want to give\
      \ as much information as we can. The places Rocket Packs are found is quite\
      \ useful information, as well as the amount of them needed to get the full backpack\
      \ of rockets. And if we merged it with Rocket Launcher, it would be hard to\
      \ make sure the user looks at the correct Rocket Pack description, as all the\
      \ Rocket Packs are simply called Rocket Packs, while now it's only a matter\
      \ of linking to Rocket Pack#Game. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 06:54,\
      \ 4 May 2008 (EDT)\n::::::I've been adding some of the links to this page, basically\
      \ I did that because it was done on the page I used as template for adding the\
      \ weapon and powerup information. At the time I wasn't thinking about what to\
      \ do with the ammo pages for I'm more interested in maps anyway. Regarding this\
      \ page I think it's actually quite nice to see the development of the rocketpack,\
      \ but maybe it fits better in an article style then as loose descriptions for\
      \ each game. For the links from map pages I think the info at the weapons could\
      \ do well if the ammo pack is included in the picture. Things like the animated\
      \ pack of 12 eightballs could be added to the rocket launcher description (and\
      \ an open and closed can on the image). Ammo locations should be in the walktrough/map\
      \ description I think, no need to put them in here. The article should need\
      \ another name so therefore I vote to merge the site --[[User:Rork|Rork]] 07:18,\

      \ so on. Is this possible? --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 13:20, 28 May\
