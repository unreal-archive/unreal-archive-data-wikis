      >Aida: Ready for the briefing?<br />\n<p>Dalton: Let's do it.<br />\n</p>\n\
      Aida: We are approaching Hell, a frozen moon orbiting the planet Gaigan, a gas\
      \ giant in the Eizo Star System. Elysium is an <a href=\"/Axon_Corporation\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Axon Corporation\">Axon Corporation</a> research\
      \ facility on Hell that works closely with the <a href=\"/TCA\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\

      \ <a href=\"/Hawkins\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hawkins\">Hawkins</a> says\
      \ there have been no transmissions from the station for 18 hours. Our mission\
      \ is to find out why. The base has four research modules located around a central\
      \ hub. Each of the labs focuses on a different area of weapons research. Here's\
      \ a look at the surrounding terrain. You'll set down here. This bridge leads\
      \ into the base. By the way, the Commander mentioned the researchers are working\
      \ on an artifact that sounds a lot like the one we recovered from <a href=\"\
      /Sanctuary\" title=\"Sanctuary\">Sanctuary</a>. You don't suppose they could\
      \ be *related*, do you? That's it. Isaak should have your weapons ready. God\
      \ knows he's had enough time.</blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right; font-size:\

      John Dalton\">John Dalton</a> and <a href=\"/Aida\" title=\"Aida\">Aida</a></div>\n\
      <p>But that's not it. Talk to Aida again to learn why she said the last sentence,\
      \ and more about the planet itself:\n</p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-bottom:\
      \ 0px;\">Aida: Still here?<br />\n<p>Dalton (Mission Summary): What's the short\
      \ form?<br />\nAida: Find out why the research facility has gone radio silent.\
      \ You can take another look at the holograms if you'd like. <br />\nDalton (More\
      \ Planetary Info): What else can you tell me about Hell?<br />\nAida: Gaigan\
      \ is a gas giant planet about 11 times the diameter of earth. Hell is one of\
      \ its 14 moons. Hell's surface is mostly rock, covered by spires of ice and\
      \ slush. The atmosphere is nitrogen and methane, along with complex compounds\
      \ like ethane, hydrogen-cyanide, and others. Thermal vents spew this poison\
      \ into the thick, soupy sky, and it falls back to the surface as toxic chemical\
      \ snow. Temperatures average around 250 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit. Delightful.<br\
      \ />\nDalton (Isaak): Why don't you let up on Isaak?<br />\nAida: Why should\
      \ I?  He killed three of my friends.  He's a danger to this ship, and the sooner\
      \ I can convince you to kick him off, the safer we'll all be.<br />\n</p>\n\
      Dalton: See ya later.</blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right; font-size:\

      <p>Now you can go and meet Isaak in the weapons bay for another dialogue:\n\
      </p>\n<blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">Isaak: Hey, boss. Got more gear\
      \ for you. Turns out that <a href=\"/Energy_rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Energy rifle\">energy rifle</a> you nabbed from the <a href=\"/Izarian\" title=\"\
      Izarian\">Izarians</a> had a limiter on it.  Maybe the <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"\
      Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> didn't want to give anything too powerful to their slaves.\
      \ Anyway, I took the limiter off and now it's a real weapon. I call it the shock\
      \ lance. The alt-fire is an EMP burst that'll fry anything electronic. I've\
      \ also loaded up the shotgun you found on Sanctuary and scrounged some toxic\
      \ grenades for your launcher. Wanna take a closer look?<br />\n<p>Dalton (Yes):\
      \ Let's see what ya got.<br />\nIsaak: I modified one of the Izarian energy\
      \ rifles to make it more powerful. Primary fire generates two plasma bolts that\
      \ don't do much damage. But the re-fire rate is high, which lets you put a lot\
      \ of hits on a target in a short amount of time. Alt-Fire creates an EMP field\
      \ that will seriously screw up any machinery it hits. Take your pick.<br />\n\
      Dalton (Shotgun): Show me the <a href=\"/Crowd_Pleaser\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Crowd Pleaser\">Crowd Pleaser</a>.<br />\nIsaak: This is an M700 12-Gauge\
      \ Semi-automatic shotgun. Absolutely lethal close up, and pretty damned good\
      \ at mid-range. The alt-fire puts out explosive incendiary slugs with a wider\
      \ spread and a more limited range. Anything else?<br />\nDalton (Toxic Grenade):\
      \ What about the gas grenade?<br />\nIsaak: It sprays out a cloud of neurotoxic\
      \ gas that is so caustic it eats right through metal armor. What'll it be?<br\
      \ />\n</p>\nDalton: Some other time.</blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right;\
      \ font-size: 88%; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 1em;\"><a href=\"/Isaak\"\
      \ title=\"Isaak\">Isaak</a> and <a href=\"/John_Dalton\" title=\"John Dalton\"\
      >John Dalton</a></div>\n<p>There are a few more things to do before you leave\
      \ Atlantis. First off, go behind Isaak and look at his desk. You'll see an <a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Artifact?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Artifact (page does\
      \ not exist)\">Artifact</a> that you've got from <a href=\"/Sanctuary\" title=\"\
      Sanctuary\">Sanctuary</a>. If you open the locker in this room, you'll see that\
      \ it now contains a Shotgun and the Energy Rifle. Now go out of the weapons\
      \ bay, up the ladder and into your own room (the first one on your left). Look\
      \ at the screen and you'll notice a few pictures from Sanctuary and <a href=\"\
      /Swamp\" title=\"Swamp\">Swamp</a> to remind you of your journeys (the picture\
      \ of <a href=\"/edit/Avalon?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Avalon (page does\
      \ not exist)\">Avalon</a> is also still there). Finally, climb down the ladder,\
      \ go into the loading bay and use the PeaceKeeper to start your mission.\n</p>\n\

      \ level starts with a short cutscene that shows PeaceKeeper landing on the surface\
      \ of Hell. Shortly after, you gain control. This place, contrary to any definitions\
      \ of Hell, is actually a very cold moon. Look up to see amazingly realistic\
      \ view of the gas giant, Gaigan. Take out your <a href=\"/Energy_Rifle\" title=\"\
      Energy Rifle\">Energy Rifle</a>, because this is probably the only place in\
      \ this mission where this weapon will be useful. The first area is relatively\
      \ peaceful, only with <a href=\"/Mukhogg\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Mukhogg\"\
      >Mukhoggs</a> trying to injure you. They fall after a single primary shot of\
      \ your Energy Rifle, so you're safe. Generally you won't see any real enemies\
      \ for a relatively long time.\n</p><p>After you start the level, you have three\
      \ ways to advance: you can use the \"road\" to the bridge which is on your left,\
      \ going under an icy arc with very realistic icicles, you can go right to the\
      \ bridge by climbing the mountain directly in front of you or you could walk\
      \ down to the valley. Generally you should look around, because this level is\
      \ amazingly realistic and was made with care.\n</p><p>If you tried to cross\
      \ the bridge, you would see a sleeping giant Mukhogg. There is no way you could\
      \ get around it without waking it, so you have three options here: continue\
      \ and wake it up, back off and fire before it wakes up or use a more interesting\
      \ way that will take you to a safe spot to kill the creature. I'll use the third\
      \ option.\n</p><p>Climb down the hill, and you'll see a pipe going just below\
      \ the bridge. Climb on it, then walk on it to the top. When you're on top, turn\
      \ left. Jump or mantle on the platform here, then walk past an arc-form bridge\
      \ support until you stand higher than you could on the pipe and can go no further.\
      \ Now when you jump facing the start of the bridge, you'll see the sleeping\
      \ Mukhogg. Take out your <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\"\
      >Dispersion Pistol</a> and kill it. It will take some time, but it won't cost\
      \ you anything and you won't be hurt. Once the beast is dead, crouch and walk\
      \ to the edge of the platform opposite the bridge itself (be careful not to\
      \ fall down!), and look down. You might see a normal sized Mukhogg there, just\
      \ standing and doing nothing. Shoot it until it dies, then go back to the start\
      \ of the pipe. Take out your Energy Rifle again, then climb back to the bridge.\
      \ Cross it, and you'll appear in a room with an open hatch. Jump down, and you'll\
      \ be on a very long elevator. A dialogue will commence.\n</p>\n<blockquote style=\"\

      \ two health pickups, two energy pickups, two CAR clips, Shotgun, 8x2 Shotgun\
      \ shells, and, strangely, a useless Dispersion Pistol. Now go out, carefully\
      \ round another corner, and notice a rather hidden Araknid pod. Shoot it and\
      \ continue to a place with fire coming from a pipe. There will be a medium Araknid\
      \ and a few small ones on the other side. Also notice a pod sticking to the\
      \ ceiling. After you clear the area, walk past the fire (stay close to the left\
      \ and you won't even have to crouch). Continue and shoot thee more pods and\
      \ fight one more medium Araknid and light Araknid. You will then see a door.\n\
      </p><p>Now you will have a light Araknid overflow. use your CAR and doors for\
      \ your gain - when it opens, shoot. Don't worry, the scientist here is already\
      \ dead, you might as well gib it. Be calm for a while, there are loads of them,\
      \ so it takes some time. After there are no more Araknids coming through the\
      \ door, cautiously go through and destroy three pods on the left side (one in\
      \ on the ceiling) and one to your right. Go right, take a CAR clip and shoot\
      \ the pod in the distance. Then go to the door (under which you can see a BSP\

      \ you want, a yet another useless Dispersion Pistol.\n</p><p>This is one of\

      \ out of the control room via the same column and explore the room. Make sure\
      \ not to fall into molten metal, it's still hot. So far I have found two shotgun\
      \ shell packs, one CAR clip, two Energy pickups and three Health pickups. Once\
      \ you're done, go out through the doors (which now glow in purple) and back\
      \ into the lift. Go down and through the door which earlier were locked. Use\
      \ your CAR on the small Araknids and your Flamethower on the medium ones. Cross\
      \ the corridor and go through the next doors. You will be in a perimeter of\
      \ the central dome. Walk forward and you will be able to see the area below.\
      \ The path to the left is blocked, so proceed to the right. Aida will say that\
      \ she found out that Axon used the beam you see here on the Artifact to test\
      \ its powers on different materials, atmospherics and animals. If you look closely,\
      \ you will see that a green beam is running to the right of you, an orange one\
      \ is in front of you and two others are disabled. You will also see a barricade\
      \ with a CAR clip and shotgun shells. Go through the door here. You will find\
      \ a few light Araknids and two Medium ones. Try to take them out with Shotgun\
      \ alt fire. After clearing the area, use your Dispersion Pistol to blast off\
      \ three Araknid pods here and, if you need, take the three Shotgun shell packs\
      \ here. Then go through the door and use your Shotgun to kil two light Araknids\
      \ and one medium Araknid. You will see an Araknid pod on the wall in front of\
      \ you - don't shoot it. Instead, use Dispersion Pistol's alt fire to destroy\
      \ a barrel under the pod. It will explode with bio goo, killing the pod in process.\
      \ Make sure you get rid of other bio barrels here. Then proceed through the\
      \ door into another lift. Use it to go up, and an announcer will say:\n</p>\n\

      \    = Single player\n}}\nHell is the third mission in [[Unreal II]]. It features\
      \ a visit to an ice planet, [[Eizo VI-C]].\n\n==Atlantis interlude==\nThe mission\
      \ begins with an [[Atlantis interlude]]. You are first shown a short cutscene\
      \ with Atlantis flying in space. Then you appear right on the captain's bridge\
      \ and [[Ne'Ban]] walks up to you. Interestingly, if you run away from him earlier\
      \ than he talks to you, Ne'Ban will follow you until you talk to him, even into\
      \ the dropship or briefing room. The dialogue goes most fluently in this order:\n\
      \n{{Quote|Ne'Ban: Greetings, Marshal.<br />\nDalton (Nice job): Great piece\
      \ of flying back there.<br />\nNe'Ban: It is a pleasure to serving.<br />\n\
      Dalton: Docking with the marine ship looked tricky, too.<br />\nNe'Ban: A maneuver\
      \ I have practicing many times.  It was an honor to re-unite those men with\
      \ their fighting unit.<br />\nDalton (Next destination?): Do you have a course\
      \ plotted?<br />\nNe'Ban: Yes. A place called Hell. At least, Aida told me to\
      \ go to Hell, so that is my plan.<br />\nDalton (Aida and Isaak?): Where is\
      \ everybody?<br />\nNe'Ban: [[Aida]] is in the briefing room, and [[Isaak]]\
      \ is in the weapons bay.<br />\nDalton: See you later.<br />\nNe'Ban: Telling\
      \ me: Is this Aida the same Aida who won the battle of [[Planets_in_the_Unreal_Universe#Unreal_II|Taiko]]\
      \ and brought victory in the [[Strider Wars]]?<br />\nDalton (Maybe): Why do\
      \ you ask?<br />\nNe'Ban: She is very famous among my people.<br />\nDalton\
      \ (Yes): [Yes,] although she doesn't like to be reminded of it.<br />\nNe'Ban:\
      \ She must have been very young, in human years.<br />\nDalton: She was.<br\
      \ />\nNe'Ban: Why is she not a general in your army?<br />\nDalton: She has\
      \ a little problem with authority. But don't worry - she's working on it.|[[John\
      \ Dalton]] and [[Ne'Ban]]}}\n\nWhen you get to know that you're all going to\
      \ hell, go down the ladder into the Briefing Room and talk to the hero of the\
      \ Strider Wars, Aida, to start the briefing so you could understand if it was\
      \ a joke of Ne'Ban or there really is a planet called Hell. Here's the dialogue:\n\
      {{Quote|Aida: Ready for the briefing?<br />\nDalton: Let's do it.<br />\nAida:\
      \ We are approaching Hell, a frozen moon orbiting the planet Gaigan, a gas giant\
      \ in the Eizo Star System. Elysium is an [[Axon Corporation]] research facility\
      \ on Hell that works closely with the [[TCA]], the organization we all so proudly\
      \ serve. Commander [[Hawkins]] says there have been no transmissions from the\
      \ station for 18 hours. Our mission is to find out why. The base has four research\
      \ modules located around a central hub. Each of the labs focuses on a different\
      \ area of weapons research. Here's a look at the surrounding terrain. You'll\
      \ set down here. This bridge leads into the base. By the way, the Commander\
      \ mentioned the researchers are working on an artifact that sounds a lot like\
      \ the one we recovered from [[Sanctuary]]. You don't suppose they could be *related*,\
      \ do you? That's it. Isaak should have your weapons ready. God knows he's had\
      \ enough time.|[[John Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\nBut that's not it. Talk to\
      \ Aida again to learn why she said the last sentence, and more about the planet\
      \ itself:\n\n{{Quote|Aida: Still here?<br />\nDalton (Mission Summary): What's\
      \ the short form?<br />\nAida: Find out why the research facility has gone radio\
      \ silent. You can take another look at the holograms if you'd like. <br />\n\
      Dalton (More Planetary Info): What else can you tell me about Hell?<br />\n\
      Aida: Gaigan is a gas giant planet about 11 times the diameter of earth. Hell\
      \ is one of its 14 moons. Hell's surface is mostly rock, covered by spires of\
      \ ice and slush. The atmosphere is nitrogen and methane, along with complex\
      \ compounds like ethane, hydrogen-cyanide, and others. Thermal vents spew this\
      \ poison into the thick, soupy sky, and it falls back to the surface as toxic\
      \ chemical snow. Temperatures average around 250 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit.\
      \ Delightful.<br />\nDalton (Isaak): Why don't you let up on Isaak?<br />\n\
      Aida: Why should I?  He killed three of my friends.  He's a danger to this ship,\
      \ and the sooner I can convince you to kick him off, the safer we'll all be.<br\
      \ />\nDalton: See ya later.|[[John Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\nNow you can go\
      \ and meet Isaak in the weapons bay for another dialogue:\n\n{{Quote|Isaak:\
      \ Hey, boss. Got more gear for you. Turns out that [[energy rifle]] you nabbed\
      \ from the [[Izarian]]s had a limiter on it.  Maybe the [[Skaarj]] didn't want\
      \ to give anything too powerful to their slaves. Anyway, I took the limiter\
      \ off and now it's a real weapon. I call it the shock lance. The alt-fire is\
      \ an EMP burst that'll fry anything electronic. I've also loaded up the shotgun\
      \ you found on Sanctuary and scrounged some toxic grenades for your launcher.\
      \ Wanna take a closer look?<br />\nDalton (Yes): Let's see what ya got.<br />\n\
      Isaak: I modified one of the Izarian energy rifles to make it more powerful.\
      \ Primary fire generates two plasma bolts that don't do much damage. But the\
      \ re-fire rate is high, which lets you put a lot of hits on a target in a short\
      \ amount of time. Alt-Fire creates an EMP field that will seriously screw up\
      \ any machinery it hits. Take your pick.<br />\nDalton (Shotgun): Show me the\
      \ [[Crowd Pleaser]].<br />\nIsaak: This is an M700 12-Gauge Semi-automatic shotgun.\
      \ Absolutely lethal close up, and pretty damned good at mid-range. The alt-fire\
      \ puts out explosive incendiary slugs with a wider spread and a more limited\
      \ range. Anything else?<br />\nDalton (Toxic Grenade): What about the gas grenade?<br\
      \ />\nIsaak: It sprays out a cloud of neurotoxic gas that is so caustic it eats\
      \ right through metal armor. What'll it be?<br />\nDalton: Some other time.|[[Isaak]]\
      \ and [[John Dalton]]}}\n\nThere are a few more things to do before you leave\
      \ Atlantis. First off, go behind Isaak and look at his desk. You'll see an [[Artifact]]\
      \ that you've got from [[Sanctuary]]. If you open the locker in this room, you'll\
      \ see that it now contains a Shotgun and the Energy Rifle. Now go out of the\
      \ weapons bay, up the ladder and into your own room (the first one on your left).\
      \ Look at the screen and you'll notice a few pictures from Sanctuary and [[Swamp]]\
      \ to remind you of your journeys (the picture of [[Avalon]] is also still there).\
      \ Finally, climb down the ladder, go into the loading bay and use the PeaceKeeper\
      \ to start your mission.\n\n==Hell==\n===Hell - Descent===\nThe level starts\
      \ with a short cutscene that shows PeaceKeeper landing on the surface of Hell.\
      \ Shortly after, you gain control. This place, contrary to any definitions of\
      \ Hell, is actually a very cold moon. Look up to see amazingly realistic view\
      \ of the gas giant, Gaigan. Take out your [[Energy Rifle]], because this is\
      \ probably the only place in this mission where this weapon will be useful.\
      \ The first area is relatively peaceful, only with [[Mukhogg]]s trying to injure\
      \ you. They fall after a single primary shot of your Energy Rifle, so you're\
      \ safe. Generally you won't see any real enemies for a relatively long time.\n\
      \nAfter you start the level, you have three ways to advance: you can use the\
      \ \"road\" to the bridge which is on your left, going under an icy arc with\
      \ very realistic icicles, you can go right to the bridge by climbing the mountain\
      \ directly in front of you or you could walk down to the valley. Generally you\
      \ should look around, because this level is amazingly realistic and was made\
      \ with care.\n\nIf you tried to cross the bridge, you would see a sleeping giant\
      \ Mukhogg. There is no way you could get around it without waking it, so you\
      \ have three options here: continue and wake it up, back off and fire before\
      \ it wakes up or use a more interesting way that will take you to a safe spot\
      \ to kill the creature. I'll use the third option.\n\nClimb down the hill, and\
      \ you'll see a pipe going just below the bridge. Climb on it, then walk on it\
      \ to the top. When you're on top, turn left. Jump or mantle on the platform\
      \ here, then walk past an arc-form bridge support until you stand higher than\
      \ you could on the pipe and can go no further. Now when you jump facing the\
      \ start of the bridge, you'll see the sleeping Mukhogg. Take out your [[Dispersion\
      \ Pistol]] and kill it. It will take some time, but it won't cost you anything\
      \ and you won't be hurt. Once the beast is dead, crouch and walk to the edge\
      \ of the platform opposite the bridge itself (be careful not to fall down!),\
      \ and look down. You might see a normal sized Mukhogg there, just standing and\
      \ doing nothing. Shoot it until it dies, then go back to the start of the pipe.\
      \ Take out your Energy Rifle again, then climb back to the bridge. Cross it,\
      \ and you'll appear in a room with an open hatch. Jump down, and you'll be on\
      \ a very long elevator. A dialogue will commence.\n\n{{Quote|Announcer: Welcome\
      \ to Elysium Weapons Research Facility. Please have your Green identification\
      \ badge displayed at all times.<br />\nDalton: Aida, did you remember to pack\
      \ my green identification badge?<br />\nAida: Yep...  Should be right next to\
      \ your pink library card. Don't worry about it. I'll hack the security system\
      \ and they'll never be the wiser. Tough security. This might take longer than\
      \ I thought.<br />\nDalton: Take your time. Looks like I'll be on this elevator\
      \ 'til early next week.|Announcer, [[John Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\nThe elevator\
      \ will stop shortly after the dialogue ends, and you'll see a door. Go inside,\
      \ and Dalton will ask:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton: How's it coming with that security\
      \ Aida?<br />\nAida: Still hacking. Done in a minute.|[[John Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\
      \nIt's no use waiting, so continue walking, even though you don't have the Green\
      \ identification badge nor the pink library card. You will soon come to a point\
      \ where you can see a warning sign on the floor: \"Security checkpoint. No unauthorised\
      \ personnel beyond this point. Firearms prohibited\", but don't mind it and\
      \ walk through. Just as you go past the yellow warning signs, electrical beams\
      \ will come out of the walls and block your way in and out of the checkpoint.\
      \ A dialogue will start:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton: Uh... Guys?<br />\nAida: What the\
      \ - Hang on John.<br />\nAnnouncer: Please remain motionless for weapons scan.\
      \ Scanning.<br />|Announcer, [[John Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\nA scanner on\
      \ the ceiling, much like the one on [[Avalon (preface)|Avalon]], will start\
      \ working. Soon enough, security systems will engage and two Gatling turrets\
      \ will come out of cylinders on both sides of the area. The dialogue continues:\n\
      \n{{Quote|Announcer: Weapons detected. Relinquish all weapons. Thirty seconds.<br\
      \ />\nDalton: Sounds like they mean it Aida.<br />\nAnnouncer: Relinquish all\
      \ weapons.<br />\nDalton: ..They really don't like guns.<br />\nAida: Damn!<br\
      \ />\nDalton: Anytime you're ready, Aida.<br />\nAida: I'm working on it!<br\
      \ />\nAnnouncer: Ten seconds. Defense turrets online.<br />\nDalton: Those look\
      \ painful. Aida!<br />\nAida: Got it!<br />\nAnnouncer: Security override. Disengaging\
      \ defense systems. Thank you and have a nice day.<br />\nDalton:So did you have\
      \ it all along or do you just like making me sweat?<br />\nAida:Go to Hell,\
      \ Dalton.<br />\nDalton: Already there, toots.|Announcer, [[John Dalton]] and\
      \ [[Aida]]}}\n\nThe dialogue ends, turrets disengage and you are free to go.\
      \ Go through an elaborate, circle-shaped yellow and black door to end this map.\n\
      \n===Hell - Discovery===\nYou start the map on a walkway above an Ops area.\
      \ Something further seems to be on fire. Turn left, go past the first door and\
      \ try to enter the room to your right. It's locked, and the PassCard Scanner\
      \ gives you an error: \"Access Denied\". A short dialogue starts:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton:\
      \ Aida, can you hack through this door?<br />\nAida: The schematics look like\
      \ spaghetti. You'll have to figure something out on your end.|[[John Dalton]]\
      \ and [[Aida]]}}\n\nSo this way is locked. Go back to the door you passed, and\
      \ try to go through. It opens, and a lift appears. Go in, and it will bring\
      \ you down from the walkway. Go past the desks here, they have nothing useful\
      \ there (all the displays show only statics). Go near the fire, and you'll notice\
      \ a few dead bodies. One of them appears to have a [[Flame Thrower]] near it,\
      \ take it. Be careful not to catch fire yourself!\n\nThen turn right and go\
      \ through the only door you have access to that looks the same as the one you\
      \ went through to end the last level. Continue walking, and you'll eventually\
      \ walk through 2 more doors that look the same, and find that the next door\
      \ is blocked by fire as well. There is another door to the left, so go through\
      \ it. You'll arrive at a first aid room with auto-heal beds. You'll get a new\
      \ objective - \"Heal the surviving patient\". It's on your right. Use a button\
      \ labelled \"Medical Station\" next to his bed to heal him. You'll get an \"\
      Objective Complete\" message. The patient gets up and starts a conversation:\n\
      \n{{Quote|Jensen: Who are you?<br />\nDalton: John Dalton. TCA Marshal. Who\
      \ are you?<br />\nJensen: Jensen. Maintenance for Area 9.<br />\nDalton: Where\
      \ is everybody?<br />\nJensen: Dead! They're all dead!<br />\nDalton: What happened?<br\
      \ />\nJensen: Alarms went off... they told me to barricade the door. And then\
      \ there was...an explosion. I crawled here to get fixed up, but I must've passed\
      \ out.<br />\nDalton: Can you walk?<br />\nJensen: Yeah, I think so.<br />\n\
      Dalton: I have to check out the rest of the facility. How can I get past the\
      \ fire in the Ops area?<br />\nJensen: You can go through the control room on\
      \ the second floor. I know the security code. There's a lift on the other side.<br\
      \ />\nDalton: Okay. Follow me.<br />\n|Hank Jensen and [[John Dalton]]}}\n\n\
      You'll get a new objective \"Bypass the fire through the second story Control\
      \ room\". Go to the other side of the room and you'll find 8 [[Shotgun]] shells.\
      \ Go back through all the doors to the Ops area, and you'll briefly talk to\
      \ Aida:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton: You heard the man Aida. Everyone's dead.<br />\n\
      Aida: I guess that explains the radio silence.<br />\nDalton: But what killed\
      \ them?<br />\nAida: I'm picking up lifeforms further in.  My guess is you'll\
      \ soon find out.|[[John Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\nGo back up to the locked\
      \ room. Jensen will unlock it for you:\n\n{{QuoteSource|I'll open the door for\
      \ you.|Jensen|Jensen}}\n\nYou'll get an \"Objective Complete\" message, and\
      \ the PassCard Scanner now says \"Access Granted\". Inthe control room, you'll\
      \ find a [[Combat Assault Rifle]] and one clip for it. Go towards the window,\
      \ and you'll see a flashing button, labelled \"Audio Log Controls\". Push it.\
      \ A log will be replayed:\n\n{{Quote|Announcer: Most recent log entry - Playback.<br\
      \ />\nUnknown person: Help! Emergency! This is Elysium. We need military support.\

      \ />\nUnknown person 2: No! Don't!<br />\n *Noise*<br />\nAnnouncer: Playback\
      \ complete.|Announcer, [[Sheffield]] and two unknown people}}\n\nNow you'll\
      \ get another \"Objective Complete\". Now go through the other door than the\
      \ one you came through, and Jensen will run to the lift. But don't follow him,\
      \ instead, go to the right of the lift. You'll find a Shotgun, a Flame Thrower\
      \ and 8 shotgun shells. Now take out your [[Dispersion Pistol]], back off and\
      \ fire at a flammable container at the end of the platform until it explodes.\
      \ Go to the place it exploded, and look at a display just below the platform.\
      \ You'll see a button, labelled \"Access Hatch\" there, so jump on it (be careful\
      \ not to fall down!) and press it. Go into the hatch that opens (again, be fast\
      \ or you'll fall down!). Go left and you'll find a corpse with a [[Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle]]. Further you will see a Napalm cannister - ammo for the Flamethrower.\
      \ Take both items. There is another hatch further in, but don't try to open\
      \ it or you'll catch fire. If you go to the other side, you'll end up being\
      \ in an unlit part of the pipe and you'll see another access hatch to the first\
      \ aid room. Either take it or go back where you came from, then go back to the\
      \ Control room. Use the lift, and you'll see Jensen waiting for you.\n\n'''WARNING!\
      \ Do not continue if you have a strong arachnophobia!''' If you want to skip\
      \ the next levels altogether, open your console (tilde key) and enter ''switchlevel\
      \ PA-Hell'' or, if you want to see what happens, but not face anything, ''killall\
      \ U2AraknidBase''. If you have a slight arachnophobia, you will be all right\
      \ with the ''god'' code.\n\nContinue the level by going through the door. Jensen\
      \ will look at the bodies and say:\n{{QuoteSource|Oh my god! Dogget's dead!\
      \ I can't take this...|Jensen|Jensen}}\n\nHead through the door. Now you will\
      \ hear strange noises, and Jensen says:\n\n{{QuoteSource|What was that?! They're\
      \ in the walls! They're coming back! Look out!|Jensen|Jensen}}\n\nFrom the top\
      \ right ventilation shaft two medium araknids and a steam of small ones will\
      \ come, killing Jensen. Meet them with your Flamethrower or CAR. The Flamethrower\
      \ is more useful against medium araknids, while CAR excels at killing the light\
      \ ones because of its explosion radius.\n\nNext up you will see another medium\
      \ Araknid. Here you will be able to take advantage of the doors in the area\
      \ - the concussive force of your CAR or Grenade Launcher can hold Araknids back.\
      \ Continue and you will meet two more medium Araknids with support from a stream\
      \ of light Araknids. Once they are finished, go get your reward of 8 [[shotgun]]\
      \ shells, a [[Combat Assault Rifle]], a flamethrower and a napalm cannister.\
      \ Ready your CAR, and blast off the light Araknids that come through the door.\
      \ Interestingly, if you get a direct hit, they will fly to a wall and get gibbed\
      \ there. Continue, and you will be ambushed by two more medium Araknids - one\
      \ from the vent in front left, another from back right. Continue with your CAR\
      \ to get rid of more light Araknids. After going through a yet another door,\
      \ the level ends.\n\n===Hell - Desolation===\n\nYou will begin in a room with\
      \ something like a generator in the middle. Don't let your guard (nor CAR) down,\
      \ because you will meet 3 more light Araknids immediately. If you went to the\
      \ other side of the room, you would see a door with smoke around it; naturally,\
      \ you can't pass. While you're here, you can practise your agility by climing\
      \ on the generator - it's even possible to climb on one of those pipes hanging\
      \ from the walls. Now choose the only way out. CAR is very useful in this situation\
      \ - the three medium Araknids have no space to jump, and your CAR can ricochet\
      \ very nicely. You should be done after 5-6 shots. Enter the room with an energy\
      \ beam and you will see a door on the right. Go to your left, where you'll find\
      \ a dead scientist with a CAR and a CAR clip. Then shoot at the beam, and a\
      \ short dialogue will commence:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton: You getting this, Aida?<br\
      \ />\nAida: High energy ion beam...  Wonder why they need this kind of power?\
      \ Let me see what I can pry out of Axon.|[[John Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\n\
      Now continue and go through the only door here. It's a lift, and once you're\
      \ up, you will face two medium Araknids. Incinerate one, and you can take a\
      \ chunk of HP from the one further from you with your CAR (it will become aggressive\
      \ if you shoot, so ready your Vulcan). After that, take the Health and Energy\
      \ pickups there. Walk to your left, near the brown gas, and Aida will inform:\n\
      \n{{QuoteSource|Nasty - ionized plasma gas. You'll have to vent it to get by.|Aida|Aida}}\n\
      \nSo, what's the way? Take out your CAR and head to the other side of the walkway,\
      \ near a broken ventilator. Crouch and you will get through. Alternatively,\
      \ you can dodge the wall near the ventilator so you would dodge into it - this\
      \ will make you etherealise though the ventilator. In it, you will find some\
      \ light Araknids (what else did you expect? ;) ). The path to the left is blocked,\
      \ so you will have to go to the right (and Araknids come from there, too). After\
      \ a short while, you will say:\n\n{{QuoteSource|Ha! Little buggers. They ain't\
      \ so bad. Uh-oh...|John Dalton|John Dalton}}\n\nThis is when you will be hoarded\
      \ by light Araknids. As long as you have your CAR, though, you're safe. You\
      \ will soon come to a place with a window. To the right you will see [[Sanctuary]]-styled\
      \ ventilation controls. Use them and watch the gas being collected (don't worry,\
      \ they're not flowing your way). Aida will say one of these lines:\n\n{{QuoteSource|Good.\
      \ That fan should suck away enough gas for you to get by.<br/>\nThat fan should\

      Well done.<br/>\nExcellent.<br/>\nGood.|Aida|Aida}}\n\nNow there is no use to\
      \ continue, so turn back. Crouch back out (or jump on the ventilator and etherealise\
      \ again). Go past the plasma (but don't touch it, it still burns). You might\
      \ think that you can dodge to the energy beam below from there. That's true,\
      \ but don't try it, you know how energy beams affect humans :). So instead,\
      \ continue round the walkway. You will see two green pods, one attched to the\
      \ wall and the other on the floor. A scientist will run through the door, just\
      \ to get killed by the Araknid pods:\n\n{{Quote|Scientist: Thank god you're\
      \ here!.. Arrgh!<br/>\nDalton: Great. Something else to watch out for.|Scientist\
      \ and [[John Dalton]]}}\n\nNotice that one pod is still closed. Use your CAR's\
      \ primary fire (shoot a single bullet) and the pod will harmlessly explode.\
      \ Go through the door that the scientist came through. There are two medium\
      \ Araknids inside - use your flamethrower and the door (medium Araknids are\
      \ too big to get though) for your advantage. After you clear the area, blast\
      \ the pod on the crate there, and take the napalm cannister. Continue round\
      \ a corner and another one to find a dead scientist with a [[shotgun]]. Take\
      \ it and carefully go through the door here. The storage room is full of pods\
      \ - shoot them all with CAR's primary (bigger pods might require more than one\
      \ shot). After you deal with all of them, take everything in the room - two\
      \ health pickups, two energy pickups, two CAR clips, Shotgun, 8x2 Shotgun shells,\
      \ and, strangely, a useless Dispersion Pistol. Now go out, carefully round another\
      \ corner, and notice a rather hidden Araknid pod. Shoot it and continue to a\
      \ place with fire coming from a pipe. There will be a medium Araknid and a few\
      \ small ones on the other side. Also notice a pod sticking to the ceiling. After\
      \ you clear the area, walk past the fire (stay close to the left and you won't\
      \ even have to crouch). Continue and shoot thee more pods and fight one more\
      \ medium Araknid and light Araknid. You will then see a door.\n\nNow you will\
      \ have a light Araknid overflow. use your CAR and doors for your gain - when\
      \ it opens, shoot. Don't worry, the scientist here is already dead, you might\
      \ as well gib it. Be calm for a while, there are loads of them, so it takes\
      \ some time. After there are no more Araknids coming through the door, cautiously\
      \ go through and destroy three pods on the left side (one in on the ceiling)\
      \ and one to your right. Go right, take a CAR clip and shoot the pod in the\
      \ distance. Then go to the door (under which you can see a BSP hole) and through\
      \ the door. Take the Energy Pickup, two CAR clips and, if you want, a yet another\
      \ useless Dispersion Pistol.\n\nThis is one of the hardest rooms in the level.\
      \ Climb up the ledge and you will be in a room full of pods. Use your CAR's\
      \ primary to blast them all and alternative to kill the small Araknids. There\
      \ is one medium Araknid, make sure you kill it before it jumps on you. You will\
      \ also see a lot of medium Araknids on the walkway above you. You can try to\
      \ ricochet your CAR or use the [[Grenade Launcher]] on them. When you go into\
      \ the room, a short conversation will start:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton: Good god, is\
      \ this where they're all coming from?<br />\nAida: No, not enough pods. And\
      \ they're too small to hold the big ones. They must be coming from further in.|[[John\
      \ Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\nDon't go to the other ledge before you kill all\
      \ the medium Araknids with you CAR and GL (you should notice a door to the right\
      \ - it's a good spot to plant a Toxic field). CAR is very useful when Araknids\
      \ stand just above you. After clearing the whole area, go to the crates under\
      \ the ledge and you will find a CAR clip, 8 shotgun shells and a grenade pack.\
      \ If you're wondering, you can climb all the way to the generator here, and\
      \ you won't die if you touch it - you will get stuck, though.\n\nNow climb the\
      \ ledge, kill the pod just in front (Dispersion Pistol works just as well when\
      \ no Araknids are around), go to the other side than the door and, if you need\
      \ it, take the Shotgun and 8 more shells. Take out tour Shotgun and go though\
      \ the door. You will see thee medium Araknids in a room very similar to the\
      \ second one in this level, with the plasma beam. Take out your Flamethrower\
      \ to kill the fourth Araknid that is on the other side of the beam and take\
      \ out your Dispersion Pistol. To the lefet you will see two pods guarding an\
      \ Energy Pickup, a Shotgun, a pack of Frag Grenades and a can of napalm. To\
      \ the right there are a lot more pods, so use your CAR's alt fire to clear them\
      \ out (if you wait long enough, they will burst and a stream of light Araknids\
      \ will come out). Take two health pickups, a CAR clip and 8 shotgun shells here.\
      \ No go through the door with your Shotgun and incinerate the medium Araknid\
      \ there, along with two light Araknids. After that, you will say:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton:\
      \ Damn, these things are tough. Never seen anything like 'em!<br />\nAida: No\
      \ one has.<br />\nDalton: Say what?<br />\nAida: It's brand new DNA. I'm reading\
      \ traces of a weird radiation that's changed their genetic structure.<br />\n\
      Dalton: Great. I'm fighting giant, killer, MUTANT spiders.|[[John Dalton]] and\
      \ [[Aida]]}}\n\nYou will see the source of the radiation soon enough. After\
      \ the interesting summary of Dalton, go past the dead Kai and through another\
      \ door there. It leads to an elevator, similar to the one you saw in the beginning.\
      \ While waiting till early next week, you can practise your mantling skills.\
      \ Once you're up at the top, the level ends.\n\n===Hell - Disclosure===\n\n\
      The level starts on top of the elevator. You are facing a door, so go ahead\
      \ and try to go through. You will be greeted with messages:\n\n{{Quote|Announcer:\
      \ Emergency lockdown in effect.<br />\nAida: The control room is on the top\
      \ level. You'll have to get up there and override the lockdown.|Announcer and\
      \ [[Aida]]}}\n\nSo it's time to turn around and use the convenient lift there.\
      \ Before you go, though, you can practise your mantling skills and see if you\
      \ can touch two yellow lights on top of the hatch above the elevator you're\
      \ standing on. When you're ready, enter the lift, click any of the three buttons\
      \ and exit it. You will hear a message:\n\n{{Quote|Now entering materials laboratory.|Announcer}}\n\
      \nYou will see doors very similar to those that you have just seen with blinking\
      \ red lights. Try to go through, and you will be denied again:\n\n{{Quote|Bulkheads:\
      \ Sealed.|Announcer}}\n\nThe other door here is also locked. There are two more\
      \ ways in - through another lift or through a broken door. Use the lift, and\
      \ once you reach the top, you will see that doors here are broken and won't\
      \ budge. Aida reports:\n\n{{QuoteSource|This doesn't look good. You'll have\
      \ to find another way up.|Aida|Aida}}\n\nSo go back down and crouch through\
      \ the door. Once you're done, a cutscene will start. It's a flyby of the area\
      \ there. A short dialogue will start:\n\n{{Quote|Aida: What a mess! How will\
      \ you get up to the control room?<br />\nDalton: That's why I get the big bucks.|[[Aida]]\
      \ and [[John Dalton]]}}\n\nNow look around. This place is full of orange beams\
      \ - and they're deadly (because they come from the [[Artifact]] - more about\
      \ this later). The only way around them is to do some rubbish jumping. If you\
      \ find something worth picking up - don't do it, you will have a better opportunity\
      \ later. If you look closely, you will find that you can get to the control\
      \ room by climbing on a white pillar that broke the glass there. Unfortunately,\
      \ you can't mantle on it. Instead, walk near the closest orange beam, jump on\
      \ a column that is near it, then mantle on a silver thing that touches the column\
      \ you're standing on. From there, jump on a dark block in front of you. Then\
      \ walk on a white tile with a hole in it and jump on a pile of tiles in front.\
      \ From there, jump down to a place with less beams and a dead scientist. Then\
      \ mantle on a dark mechanism that changes the beam's direction and jump on a\
      \ nearby pile of tiles. Then jump down (alternatively, you could reach the same\
      \ place by crouching and pressing space to prone, then prone below the beam\
      \ to avoid it). Now mantle on a big white block, then another one and take a\
      \ pack of frag grenades. Now jump down again, walk around the corner and dodge\
      \ on the silver tile there. Make sure you don't fall into molten metal!\n\n\
      Now is the tricky part. You can't jump on those poles in the metal normally.\
      \ But you can mantle - so simply jump towards the first pole and hold jump,\
      \ you will make an air mantle. Do the same with the next block and then another\
      \ one. Now jump on another pile of tiles and jump jump down on the floor. Prone\
      \ or crouch around a tile with a hole in it. Walk on a tile and jump over the\
      \ beam on a silver tile. Next, you will have to jump on another pole just to\
      \ the right from another mechanism which changes beam's direction. You will\
      \ then see a few crossed beams. Jump down to the place where you can see half\
      \ of a broken tile. Jump on it, then over two crossed beams and you're there!\
      \ Mantle on the broken column base, then jump on the column and walk into the\
      \ control room. Once you're there, you will get an \"Objective complete\" message.\
      \ Press both buttons you see in the room. After pressing the beam control button,\
      \ you will get another flyby sequence that shows you how the beam is disengaged.\
      \ After pressing the second button, you will get an announcement:\n\n{{Quote|Emergency\
      \ Override 347 Accepted. Lockdown disengaged.|Announcer}}\n\nThis means that\
      \ all the doors are now open. Walk out of the control room via the same column\
      \ and explore the room. Make sure not to fall into molten metal, it's still\
      \ hot. So far I have found two shotgun shell packs, one CAR clip, two Energy\
      \ pickups and three Health pickups. Once you're done, go out through the doors\
      \ (which now glow in purple) and back into the lift. Go down and through the\
      \ door which earlier were locked. Use your CAR on the small Araknids and your\
      \ Flamethower on the medium ones. Cross the corridor and go through the next\
      \ doors. You will be in a perimeter of the central dome. Walk forward and you\
      \ will be able to see the area below. The path to the left is blocked, so proceed\
      \ to the right. Aida will say that she found out that Axon used the beam you\
      \ see here on the Artifact to test its powers on different materials, atmospherics\
      \ and animals. If you look closely, you will see that a green beam is running\
      \ to the right of you, an orange one is in front of you and two others are disabled.\
      \ You will also see a barricade with a CAR clip and shotgun shells. Go through\
      \ the door here. You will find a few light Araknids and two Medium ones. Try\
      \ to take them out with Shotgun alt fire. After clearing the area, use your\
      \ Dispersion Pistol to blast off three Araknid pods here and, if you need, take\
      \ the three Shotgun shell packs here. Then go through the door and use your\
      \ Shotgun to kil two light Araknids and one medium Araknid. You will see an\
      \ Araknid pod on the wall in front of you - don't shoot it. Instead, use Dispersion\
      \ Pistol's alt fire to destroy a barrel under the pod. It will explode with\
      \ bio goo, killing the pod in process. Make sure you get rid of other bio barrels\
      \ here. Then proceed through the door into another lift. Use it to go up, and\
      \ an announcer will say:\n\n{{Quote|Now entering atmospherics laboratory.|Announcer}}\n\
      \nDoors here are locked just as in the last laboratory. Take a 8 more Shotgun\
      \ shells if you need them and use another lift to get to the control room. Look\
      \ through the windows. The left room has three medium Araknids in it. The middle\
      \ room has plasma in it. The right room has nothing. So use all the pressure\
      \ controls beginning from the left. The Araknids in the leftmost room will try\
      \ to break into your room, but unsuccessfully, and will be gibbed shortly. The\
      \ middle room will have plasma sucked out of the room. The right room will do\
      \ nothing. Now turn off the beam and a dialogue will start:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton:\
      \ Which way out, Aida?<br />\nAida: The main route is blocked. But the schematics\
      \ show an access hatch at the end of the plasma beam tube. Can you squeeze yourself\
      \ down there?<br />\nDalton: Who pulls me out if I get stuck?<br />\nAida: Not\
      \ me! Ne'Ban and Isaak can draw straws.|[[John Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\nDeactivate\
      \ the lockdown again:\n\n{{Quote|Emergency Override 347 Accepted. Lockdown disengaged.|Announcer}}\n\
      \nNow go down the lift and enter the left room. Collect the free Shotgun, CAR\
      \ clip, pack of Frag grenades, napalm cannister, Health pickup and Energy pickup\
      \ there. Go back and into the middle room, then jump into the beam tube. Take\
      \ out your Dispersion Pistol and calmly fire forward as you proceed. Many light\
      \ Araknids will die there. Once you're done, you will reach two hatches. Use\
      \ the left hatch controls, and they will get a short circuit. Use the right\
      \ controls, and they open. Go through, prepare your Flamethrower and jump down.\
      \ Take out two medium and two light Araknids. Go past the door here and take\
      \ a Shotgun and a CAR clip from a dead scientist. Go into the corridor, then\
      \ kill all the Araknids here with your Shotgun alt fire and take 8 more shotgun\
      \ shells. Go through another door, kill a Medium and light Araknid there. Use\
      \ the lift and you will get into:\n\n{{Quote|Now entering biological laboratory.\
      \ Biological specimen containment breach.|Announcer}}\n\nAs usual, go to the\
      \ control room. The left room has some cages. The middle room has the orange\
      \ beam and you can see light Araknids being converted into medium Araknids there.\
      \ A dialogue will start:\n\n{{Quote|Dalton: So this is where the spiders are\
      \ coming from. It's a breeding farm!<br />\nAida: Biological experiments. The\
      \ little ones walk through the beam, and suddenly they're huge.<br />\nDalton:\
      \ And somehow they got out.<br />\nAida: Not only that, but this beam has been\
      \ split. It has only a fraction of the original's power. If one of these creatures\
      \ makes it to the source, there's no telling what might happen to it.<br />\n\
      Dalton: But that's where the artifact is.  So that's where I gotta go.|[[John\
      \ Dalton]] and [[Aida]]}}\n\nNow release all cages and hopefully mutated Mukhogg,\
      \ Snipe or Rammer will be able to stop those Araknids from generating, making\
      \ progress easier. Override the locks and go down through the left door. Go\
      \ down the crack there, kill any Araknids you see, take the CAR, CAR clips,\
      \  Health Pickup, Energy Pickup, Shotgun shells and run as far forward as you\
      \ can get, killing any pods and Araknids you see. They generate new ones over\
      \ and over again, so be very quick! Take Toxic Grenades, 3x8 shotgun shells,\
      \ Health and Energy pickups on the way. When you reach the end, you will get\
      \ Aida's message:\n\n{{QuoteSource|The artifact is in the beam. You've got to\
      \ shut it down. The controls are right next to it, but be careful. There's something\
      \ else in there. Something big.|Aida|Aida}}\n\nJump down now. The level boss\
      \ will do the same. It's a Heavy Araknid. This monster can shoot spider pods,\
      \ and small Araknids will walk towards the beam to get upgraded to medium Araknids!\
      \ Use your whole arsenal to kill your opponents, and make sure none of the small\
      \ Araknids reach the Artifact! Best weapons against the Heavy Araknid are Toxic\
      \ Grenades and your Flamethrower. Once it's done, the heavy Araknid will scream\
      \ and explode, making the protective glass on the beam controls to shatter.\
      \ You can recharge your health and shields here, but you won't need that any\
      \ longer so you might as well just press the controls. Then take the Weapon\
      \ Damage [[Artifact]] and the level ends.\n\n==Second cutscene==\n\nIn this\
      \ cutscene you see PeaceKeeper flying from Hell back to TCA Atlantis. Once it\
      \ lands in it, Atlantis turns away from Gaigan and flies away, possibly to the\

      \ similar ones later, although Gaigan does look pretty.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Some\
