      \ walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n</p><p>The UMS Prometheus went\
      \ down in a deep valley, breaking into two halves on impact. Now, as your mission\
      \ for the UMS is approaching completion, you are about to face a tough slog\
      \ of Mercenaries infesting the downed vessel.\n</p><p>You start at the top of\
      \ the lift you took to exit the previous level. You are in a small rock canyon.\
      \ Step forwards and you'll reach a ledge where the ground drops away below.\n\
      </p><p>To the right at the end of this lege is an entrance in the rock cliff\
      \ but it is impassable, blocked off by planks. Look instead down off the ledge;\
      \ you will see the ground below and another ledge part of the way down on which\
      \ there is a barrel. Drop down on to this intermediate ledge and shoot the barrel\
      \ open for a <a href=\"/Seed\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seed\">Nali Fruit\
      \ Seed</a>.\n</p><p>Drop down to the ground level. At the head of the canyon\
      \ is nothing but a boulder-blocked tunnel you may recognise from the previous\
      \ map. So, go instead down past some hay bales to the mouth of the canyon. At\
      \ the mouth of the canyon, you emerge in the huge valley that holds the towering\
      \ crashed ship. Watch out for a <a href=\"/Gasbag\" title=\"Gasbag\">Gasbag</a>\
      \ that descends from the left.\n</p><p>Kill the Gasbag and climb the slanting\
      \ rock on the right to collect a <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a> from a small plateau. Then, return\
      \ to ground level and head through the valley to the left towards a UMS drop\
      \ box that you saw from your high vantage point in the previous map. Open the\
      \ box for a <a href=\"/Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"Grenade Launcher\">Grenade\
      \ Launcher</a>.\n</p><p>Continue straight on from the drop box until you reach\
      \ a pillar of rock. Go down the earth slope to the right beneath the crashed\
      \ ship and follow round the edge of the rock pillar. You will soon find yourself\
      \ in the gap between the two halves of the crashed ship, with a pair of force\
      \ field bridges above connecting the broken corridors.\n</p><p>Go towards the\
      \ force field bridges then veer off to the right beneath the hull of the ship.\
      \ You will see that you are approaching an access ramp into the ship that is\
      \ guarded by a Mercenary. Kill the Mercenary with your Grenade Launcher. I would\
      \ emphasise at this point that the Grenade Launcher and <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\">CAR</a> would be your\
      \ weapons of choice for this level because of the types of ammo you are going\
      \ to find on the Terran ship.\n</p><p>When the Mercenary is dead, destroy wooden\
      \ crates to the left of the ramp for a <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flare</a>\
      \ and a box of 50 Bullets. Collect the gear, then go up the ramp into one of\
      \ the ship's ammo storage holds. Your arrival inside will quickly attract the\
      \ attention of a Mercenary and a <a href=\"/Mercenary\" title=\"Mercenary\"\
      >MercenaryElite</a> on guard in the hold. Back off down the ramp and kill the\
      \ pair; be particularly careful of the MercenaryElite's ability to fire whilst\
      \ shielded.\n</p><p>When the guards are dead, climb the ramp once more. If you\
      \ go to the right and approach the door there, you will find that it will not\
      \ open properly. So, follow further round to the right behind the crates there\
      \ and go to the far end of the hold. There, you will find a crate open with\
      \ two 50 bullet CAR Clips on offer. Avoid the door to the left at this end of\
      \ the room, and go further again round to the right. You will see a third door\
      \ ahead, but go round to the right once more first to grab a pack of 10 Grenades.\n\
      </p><p>Return to this third door and go through it. You will emerge in one of\
      \ the ship's corridors. The corridor leads to the left; follow it to the next\
      \ entrance, jumping over debris from a collapsed door and going through the\
      \ doorway from which the door evidently fell. You will be in another ammo hold.\
      \ As you enter, watch out for a Mercenary and a MercenaryElite who attack, coming\
      \ through the door ahead.\n</p><p>Cross the hold to the far side. There, open\
      \ crates reveal a <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket\
      \ Launcher</a> and a pack of 10 Rockets. Go through the door on this side to\
      \ enter a corridor parallel to the previous one. Left is doubling back, so go\
      \ along to the right. The corridor turns a right corner and soon reaches a central\
      \ point where the lower of the two force field bridges stretches across from\
      \ the entrance to the left, while a door marked \"Turbo-lift\" sits to the right.\
      \ Near this junction, a <a href=\"/Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Health Pack\">Health Pack</a> sits beneath a unit marked \"First Aid Station\"\
      . Collect the pack. If you need any further health, then wait a few seconds\
      \ and the health will respawn and you can collect it again. There is no limit\
      \ on the use of this Respawning Health Pack.\n</p><p>You can look through the\
      \ turbo-lift door, but the lift is raised and you will be squished if it comes\
      \ down. So, go to the left out on to the force field bridge and cross to the\
      \ other half of the broken ship. As you reach the far side, there will be a\
      \ small ship-quake. Ignore this and look around. You are at a corridor junction;\
      \ ahead is a turbo-lift in the down position, and there are hatch doors on either\
      \ side. Step into the turbo-lift first. At the top, you will find that a force\
      \ field blocks the exit, behind which a MercenaryElite is directing a Mercenary\
      \ with a hovering carrier.\n</p><p>Ride the lift back down and step out. Turn\
      \ around so that you stand facing the turbo-lift then go through the door that\
      \ is now on the left.\n</p><p>Follow the corridor. A Mercenary will dart out\
      \ from a corner ahead; kill it. Continue along the corridor - half way along\
      \ a panel will spring into life on the left [1].\n</p><p>Go along to the corner\
      \ and collect the Health Pack there (remember the Respawning Health Pack over\
      \ the force field bridge if you need more). Go round the corner and follow the\
      \ next stretch, but watch out for a gap in the walkway about half way along\
      \ with molten metal beneath where one of the circuit networks has overloaded.\
      \ Go through the door at the far end of the corridor. You emerge on a raised\
      \ platform with a ramp descending to a damaged engine pipe surrounded by molten\
      \ metal ahead. Watch out for a MercenaryElite which attacks from the right.\
      \ If you back off into the corridor, mind that broken walkway.\n</p><p>When\
      \ the Mercenary is dead, descend the ramp and collect the two 50 bullet CAR\
      \ Clips from the corpse on the floor to the right of the ramp.\n</p><p>Shortcut:\
      \ You will need to go into the damaged engine pipe. You can do so now if you\
      \ wish; in the pool of molten metal ahead are pieces of solid debris. Use them\
      \ as stepping stones to get into the pipe, then ascend to the top of the sloping\
      \ section. Go to §.\n</p><p>Return to the corridor and follow it back round\
      \ to the junction (mind that gap). Cross over the junction and go through the\
      \ other hatch into another similar corridor. Half way along the first stretch,\
      \ you will find another panel [2].\n</p><p>At the corner, collect the Health\
      \ Pack. Then follow the next stretch to the left. There's one final panel [3].\n\
      </p><p>Go down to the end of the corridor and through the door there. You will\
      \ be on another raised platform and ramp over a floor below. This room continues\
      \ further back - as you enter there is a small explosion and a ship quake as\
      \ a Mercenary and a MercenaryElite come running from the back. Kill them both.\
      \ I would remind you again at this point of the Respawning Health Pack back\
      \ over the force field bridge.\n</p><p>Descend the ramp and collect the box\
      \ of 50 Bullets from a corpse to the left. Go to the back of the room and you\
      \ will find a way through beneath the engine pipe. Go through and double back\
      \ along the other side of the pipe. Turn right at the end, and you will be at\
      \ a small control room in the centre of the engineering area.\n</p><p>The far\
      \ entrance of this room leads out to molten metal. To the right is a lift. To\
      \ the left is a Health Pack in a first aid station - shoot the glass to access\
      \ it. Collect the Combat Assault Rifle and 50 bullet CAR Clip from a corpse\
      \ here, then read the panels on either side of the room [4-5].\n</p><p>When\
      \ you're done, go to the back of the room and ride the lift up to the level\
      \ above. You will be in a raised corridor; to either side metal walkways lead\
      \ out past the engine pipes. Go to the left and look along the walkway - you\
      \ will see that it is damaged. A Mercenary snipes from the far end; shoot it,\
      \ but beware a Mercenary coming round from behind - don't get ditched into the\
      \ molten metal below.\n</p><p>Go back through and along the undamaged walkway,\
      \ then go round into a corridor at the far end to find another Health Pack in\
      \ a first aid station. Then, go out on to the damaged walkway and inspect the\
      \ engine pipe. There is a breach in the engine pipe here; jump from the fragment\
      \ of damaged walkway opposite and land inside the pipe.\n</p><p>§ You are at\
      \ the top of the collapsed section of pipe mentioned earlier. Follow the horizontal\
      \ stretch of pipe along, but watch out for the small pools of molten metal inside.\
      \ At the top, you are in a small chamber. Climb on to the raised section of\
      \ floor here and go round towards a raised walkway over a tank of molten metal.\
      \ As you approach, a couple of sections of the walkway collapse. Jump across\
      \ on to the walkway. Follow it to the right. A round entrance to the right requires\
      \ you to jump through on to the next section of walkway - watch out because\
      \ pieces of that walkway collapse too. My advice is to cross it as quickly as\
      \ possible, jumping as you go.\n</p><p>Repeat the exercise for one more weak\
      \ walkway. At the far end, jump into the pipe there, and you will find that\
      \ it slopes upwards before bringing you suddenly up on to the roof of the crashed\
      \ ship. It's very dark so it's difficult to see where you are going. You don't\
      \ want to fall off, because you'll die. Look for the upward slope of the hull\
      \ and climb up it. If you want to get your bearings first, look round from your\
      \ current position and you'll see the green lights trimming the hull.\n</p><p>Climb\
      \ the slope of the hull and go over the top. You will soon be sloping downwards\
      \ again towards the trimming lights on the other side of the hull. Make your\
      \ target a UMS drop box ahead containing two Health Packs.\n</p><p>Approach\
      \ the box. In doing so you will attract the attention of a pair of Mercenaries\
      \ who attack from the right. Kill them both. Follow the edge of the hull to\
      \ the right from the Health Packs (use the green lights as a guide). When you\
      \ reach the last green lights you are very close to the break in the ship so\
      \ be careful. At this point, turn right and climb the hull, heading for a dim\
      \ blue glow you may see up there.\n</p><p>The dim glow turns out to have been\
      \ emanating from a pair of small rooms that have had their roofs ripped off.\
      \ Enter the one on the right and collect the 50 bullet CAR Clip you find there,\
      \ and also a pack of 10 Rockets in the same room. Then, go through the door\
      \ from this room into the inside corridor. A Mercenary is lurking there; kill\
      \ it. Go left and you will reach a crossways stretch of the corridor with a\
      \ pair of lift shafts on one side. Go along this stretch and open the first\
      \ aid station there for a Health Pack. As you approach, you find you are at\
      \ the top of the turbo-lift you investigated earlier. The force field blocking\
      \ it collapses as you approach.\n</p><p>Go on round, past another lift, into\
      \ the next stretch of corridor parallel to the first, and kill the Mercenary\
      \ lurking there. Visit the two small rooms on the left. The first contains a\
      \ Health Pack. The second contains a Combat Assault Rifle. Now it's time for\
      \ the lifts. Of the two, the one on the left leads to a corridor that goes out\
      \ to the break in the ship. Avoid it. Take the one on the right, which leads\
      \ to the upper force field bridge.\n</p><p>Cross the bridge. You arrive in a\
      \ corridor junction. To the left, the place is smashed and impassable. To the\
      \ right leads a corridor marked \"Crew Berths\". There's a panel ahead [6].\n\
      </p><p>Go down the crew berths corridor to the right. Turning a corner, you\
      \ will be attacked by a Mercenary from a distance while another emerges from\
      \ the first door on the right, the one marked \"5\". Kill them both. Visit berth\
      \ 5 and you will find an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a> in a closet. Then, return to the corridor and\
      \ go along to berth 6. It is empty. In berth 7, you can collect a 50 bullet\
      \ CAR Clip from the closet and read a diary [7].\n</p><p>Go through the door\
      \ at the end of the corridor and enter the next stretch.\n</p><p>There are two\
      \ doors on the left and three more berths on the right. Go first to berth 8\
      \ on the right and open the closet for a Health Pack, then read another diary\
      \ here [8].\n</p><p>Open closets in the remaining two berths for two ASMD Cores\
      \ and another Health Pack, then go across the corridor and through one of the\
      \ doors on the other side. You are in some kind of medical bay, with a hole\
      \ in the floor. There is nothing else of interest here except for some body\
      \ parts, so jump through the hole to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ\
      \ on other difficulty settings.''\n\nThe UMS Prometheus went down in a deep\
      \ valley, breaking into two halves on impact. Now, as your mission for the UMS\
      \ is approaching completion, you are about to face a tough slog of Mercenaries\
      \ infesting the downed vessel.\n\nYou start at the top of the lift you took\
      \ to exit the previous level. You are in a small rock canyon. Step forwards\
      \ and you'll reach a ledge where the ground drops away below.\n\nTo the right\
      \ at the end of this lege is an entrance in the rock cliff but it is impassable,\
      \ blocked off by planks. Look instead down off the ledge; you will see the ground\
      \ below and another ledge part of the way down on which there is a barrel. Drop\
      \ down on to this intermediate ledge and shoot the barrel open for a [[Seed|Nali\
      \ Fruit Seed]].\n\nDrop down to the ground level. At the head of the canyon\
      \ is nothing but a boulder-blocked tunnel you may recognise from the previous\
      \ map. So, go instead down past some hay bales to the mouth of the canyon. At\
      \ the mouth of the canyon, you emerge in the huge valley that holds the towering\
      \ crashed ship. Watch out for a [[Gasbag]] that descends from the left.\n\n\
      Kill the Gasbag and climb the slanting rock on the right to collect a [[Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit]] from a small plateau. Then, return to ground level and head\
      \ through the valley to the left towards a UMS drop box that you saw from your\
      \ high vantage point in the previous map. Open the box for a [[Grenade Launcher]].\n\
      \nContinue straight on from the drop box until you reach a pillar of rock. Go\
      \ down the earth slope to the right beneath the crashed ship and follow round\
      \ the edge of the rock pillar. You will soon find yourself in the gap between\
      \ the two halves of the crashed ship, with a pair of force field bridges above\
      \ connecting the broken corridors.\n\nGo towards the force field bridges then\
      \ veer off to the right beneath the hull of the ship. You will see that you\
      \ are approaching an access ramp into the ship that is guarded by a Mercenary.\
      \ Kill the Mercenary with your Grenade Launcher. I would emphasise at this point\
      \ that the Grenade Launcher and [[Combat Assault Rifle|CAR]] would be your weapons\
      \ of choice for this level because of the types of ammo you are going to find\
      \ on the Terran ship.\n\nWhen the Mercenary is dead, destroy wooden crates to\
      \ the left of the ramp for a [[Flare]] and a box of 50 Bullets. Collect the\
      \ gear, then go up the ramp into one of the ship's ammo storage holds. Your\
      \ arrival inside will quickly attract the attention of a Mercenary and a [[Mercenary|MercenaryElite]]\
      \ on guard in the hold. Back off down the ramp and kill the pair; be particularly\
      \ careful of the MercenaryElite's ability to fire whilst shielded.\n\nWhen the\
      \ guards are dead, climb the ramp once more. If you go to the right and approach\
      \ the door there, you will find that it will not open properly. So, follow further\
      \ round to the right behind the crates there and go to the far end of the hold.\
      \ There, you will find a crate open with two 50 bullet CAR Clips on offer. Avoid\
      \ the door to the left at this end of the room, and go further again round to\
      \ the right. You will see a third door ahead, but go round to the right once\
      \ more first to grab a pack of 10 Grenades.\n\nReturn to this third door and\
      \ go through it. You will emerge in one of the ship's corridors. The corridor\
      \ leads to the left; follow it to the next entrance, jumping over debris from\
      \ a collapsed door and going through the doorway from which the door evidently\
      \ fell. You will be in another ammo hold. As you enter, watch out for a Mercenary\
      \ and a MercenaryElite who attack, coming through the door ahead.\n\nCross the\
      \ hold to the far side. There, open crates reveal a [[Rocket Launcher]] and\
      \ a pack of 10 Rockets. Go through the door on this side to enter a corridor\
      \ parallel to the previous one. Left is doubling back, so go along to the right.\
      \ The corridor turns a right corner and soon reaches a central point where the\
      \ lower of the two force field bridges stretches across from the entrance to\
      \ the left, while a door marked \"Turbo-lift\" sits to the right. Near this\
      \ junction, a [[Health Pack]] sits beneath a unit marked \"First Aid Station\"\
      . Collect the pack. If you need any further health, then wait a few seconds\
      \ and the health will respawn and you can collect it again. There is no limit\
      \ on the use of this Respawning Health Pack.\n\nYou can look through the turbo-lift\
      \ door, but the lift is raised and you will be squished if it comes down. So,\
      \ go to the left out on to the force field bridge and cross to the other half\
      \ of the broken ship. As you reach the far side, there will be a small ship-quake.\
      \ Ignore this and look around. You are at a corridor junction; ahead is a turbo-lift\
      \ in the down position, and there are hatch doors on either side. Step into\
      \ the turbo-lift first. At the top, you will find that a force field blocks\
      \ the exit, behind which a MercenaryElite is directing a Mercenary with a hovering\
      \ carrier.\n\nRide the lift back down and step out. Turn around so that you\
      \ stand facing the turbo-lift then go through the door that is now on the left.\n\
      \nFollow the corridor. A Mercenary will dart out from a corner ahead; kill it.\
      \ Continue along the corridor - half way along a panel will spring into life\
      \ on the left [1].\n\nGo along to the corner and collect the Health Pack there\
      \ (remember the Respawning Health Pack over the force field bridge if you need\
      \ more). Go round the corner and follow the next stretch, but watch out for\
      \ a gap in the walkway about half way along with molten metal beneath where\
      \ one of the circuit networks has overloaded. Go through the door at the far\
      \ end of the corridor. You emerge on a raised platform with a ramp descending\
      \ to a damaged engine pipe surrounded by molten metal ahead. Watch out for a\
      \ MercenaryElite which attacks from the right. If you back off into the corridor,\
      \ mind that broken walkway.\n\nWhen the Mercenary is dead, descend the ramp\
      \ and collect the two 50 bullet CAR Clips from the corpse on the floor to the\
      \ right of the ramp.\n\nShortcut: You will need to go into the damaged engine\
      \ pipe. You can do so now if you wish; in the pool of molten metal ahead are\
      \ pieces of solid debris. Use them as stepping stones to get into the pipe,\
      \ then ascend to the top of the sloping section. Go to §.\n\nReturn to the corridor\
      \ and follow it back round to the junction (mind that gap). Cross over the junction\
      \ and go through the other hatch into another similar corridor. Half way along\
      \ the first stretch, you will find another panel [2].\n\nAt the corner, collect\
      \ the Health Pack. Then follow the next stretch to the left. There's one final\
      \ panel [3].\n\nGo down to the end of the corridor and through the door there.\
      \ You will be on another raised platform and ramp over a floor below. This room\
      \ continues further back - as you enter there is a small explosion and a ship\
      \ quake as a Mercenary and a MercenaryElite come running from the back. Kill\
      \ them both. I would remind you again at this point of the Respawning Health\
      \ Pack back over the force field bridge.\n\nDescend the ramp and collect the\
      \ box of 50 Bullets from a corpse to the left. Go to the back of the room and\
      \ you will find a way through beneath the engine pipe. Go through and double\
      \ back along the other side of the pipe. Turn right at the end, and you will\
      \ be at a small control room in the centre of the engineering area.\n\nThe far\
      \ entrance of this room leads out to molten metal. To the right is a lift. To\
      \ the left is a Health Pack in a first aid station - shoot the glass to access\
      \ it. Collect the Combat Assault Rifle and 50 bullet CAR Clip from a corpse\
      \ here, then read the panels on either side of the room [4-5].\n\nWhen you're\
      \ done, go to the back of the room and ride the lift up to the level above.\
      \ You will be in a raised corridor; to either side metal walkways lead out past\
      \ the engine pipes. Go to the left and look along the walkway - you will see\
      \ that it is damaged. A Mercenary snipes from the far end; shoot it, but beware\
      \ a Mercenary coming round from behind - don't get ditched into the molten metal\
      \ below.\n\nGo back through and along the undamaged walkway, then go round into\
      \ a corridor at the far end to find another Health Pack in a first aid station.\
      \ Then, go out on to the damaged walkway and inspect the engine pipe. There\
      \ is a breach in the engine pipe here; jump from the fragment of damaged walkway\
      \ opposite and land inside the pipe.\n\n§ You are at the top of the collapsed\
      \ section of pipe mentioned earlier. Follow the horizontal stretch of pipe along,\
      \ but watch out for the small pools of molten metal inside. At the top, you\
      \ are in a small chamber. Climb on to the raised section of floor here and go\
      \ round towards a raised walkway over a tank of molten metal. As you approach,\
      \ a couple of sections of the walkway collapse. Jump across on to the walkway.\
      \ Follow it to the right. A round entrance to the right requires you to jump\
      \ through on to the next section of walkway - watch out because pieces of that\
      \ walkway collapse too. My advice is to cross it as quickly as possible, jumping\
      \ as you go.\n\nRepeat the exercise for one more weak walkway. At the far end,\
      \ jump into the pipe there, and you will find that it slopes upwards before\
      \ bringing you suddenly up on to the roof of the crashed ship. It's very dark\
      \ so it's difficult to see where you are going. You don't want to fall off,\
      \ because you'll die. Look for the upward slope of the hull and climb up it.\
      \ If you want to get your bearings first, look round from your current position\
      \ and you'll see the green lights trimming the hull.\n\nClimb the slope of the\
      \ hull and go over the top. You will soon be sloping downwards again towards\
      \ the trimming lights on the other side of the hull. Make your target a UMS\
      \ drop box ahead containing two Health Packs.\n\nApproach the box. In doing\
      \ so you will attract the attention of a pair of Mercenaries who attack from\
      \ the right. Kill them both. Follow the edge of the hull to the right from the\
      \ Health Packs (use the green lights as a guide). When you reach the last green\
      \ lights you are very close to the break in the ship so be careful. At this\
      \ point, turn right and climb the hull, heading for a dim blue glow you may\
      \ see up there.\n\nThe dim glow turns out to have been emanating from a pair\
      \ of small rooms that have had their roofs ripped off. Enter the one on the\
      \ right and collect the 50 bullet CAR Clip you find there, and also a pack of\
      \ 10 Rockets in the same room. Then, go through the door from this room into\
      \ the inside corridor. A Mercenary is lurking there; kill it. Go left and you\
      \ will reach a crossways stretch of the corridor with a pair of lift shafts\
      \ on one side. Go along this stretch and open the first aid station there for\
      \ a Health Pack. As you approach, you find you are at the top of the turbo-lift\
      \ you investigated earlier. The force field blocking it collapses as you approach.\n\
      \nGo on round, past another lift, into the next stretch of corridor parallel\
      \ to the first, and kill the Mercenary lurking there. Visit the two small rooms\
      \ on the left. The first contains a Health Pack. The second contains a Combat\
      \ Assault Rifle. Now it's time for the lifts. Of the two, the one on the left\
      \ leads to a corridor that goes out to the break in the ship. Avoid it. Take\
      \ the one on the right, which leads to the upper force field bridge.\n\nCross\
      \ the bridge. You arrive in a corridor junction. To the left, the place is smashed\
      \ and impassable. To the right leads a corridor marked \"Crew Berths\". There's\
      \ a panel ahead [6].\n\nGo down the crew berths corridor to the right. Turning\
      \ a corner, you will be attacked by a Mercenary from a distance while another\
      \ emerges from the first door on the right, the one marked \"5\". Kill them\
      \ both. Visit berth 5 and you will find an [[Assault Vest]] in a closet. Then,\
      \ return to the corridor and go along to berth 6. It is empty. In berth 7, you\
      \ can collect a 50 bullet CAR Clip from the closet and read a diary [7].\n\n\
      Go through the door at the end of the corridor and enter the next stretch.\n\
      \nThere are two doors on the left and three more berths on the right. Go first\
      \ to berth 8 on the right and open the closet for a Health Pack, then read another\
      \ diary here [8].\n\nOpen closets in the remaining two berths for two ASMD Cores\
      \ and another Health Pack, then go across the corridor and through one of the\
      \ doors on the other side. You are in some kind of medical bay, with a hole\
      \ in the floor. There is nothing else of interest here except for some body\
      \ parts, so jump through the hole to exit the level.\n\n== Translator messages\
