      \ the output of any targeted player who is also using the Link. Two players\
      \ may Link to one another at any time, boosting the power output of the weapon\

      >UT2004 manual</div>\n<p>As with most UT2003 weapons, the UT2004 version of\
      \ the Link Gun has remained largely the same, though it has received several\
      \ subtle changes. The Link Gun's appearance has been altered. The primary fire\
      \ now consumes 2 ammo per shot, and the secondary fire has a greater fire rate\
      \ of over 9 hits per second, although the damage per hit has been decreased\
      \ to 9 such that its rate of damage has been unchanged. In compensation for\
      \ the increased ammo consumption rate, the ammo capacity of the UT2004 Link\
      \ Gun has been increased.\n</p><p>In UT2004, players can also repair <a href=\"\
      /Category:Vehicles\" title=\"Category:Vehicles\">vehicles</a> and <a href=\"\
      /Onslaught#Power_Node\" title=\"Onslaught\">Power Nodes</a> with the alternate\
      \ fire, greatly increasing the utility of this weapon in <a href=\"/Onslaught\"\
      \ title=\"Onslaught\">Onslaught</a>, <a href=\"/Vehicle_CTF\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Vehicle CTF\">Vehicle CTF</a>, and certain <a href=\"/Assault\" title=\"\
      Assault\">Assault</a> maps. The heal amount and speed of most vehicles and turrets\
      \ can be configured by Level Designers, but due to the default settings, generally\
      \ the speed is quite low for the automatic floor and ceiling sentinel turrets\
      \ in Assault maps.\n</p><p>Note that linking up is much more efficient than\
      \ in UT2003. With <i>n</i> links your primary fire still has a damage multiplier\
      \ of 1 + <i>n</i>, but the beam damage or healing scales up by 1 + (1.5 × <i>n</i>).\
      \ This basically means you can build/heal nodes much faster if you link together\
      \ instead of separately aiming directly at the node. An example: Two players\
      \ separately aiming at the node heal it by 2 × 82.5 = 165 points per second.\
      \ If one of the players linked to the other instead, the combined healing would\
      \ be (1 + 1.5) × 82.5 = 206.25 points per second. The same example applies to\
      \ healing vehicles or firing the beam at enemies.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"\

      \ Dynamic Weapon Systems is best known for their all-purpose combat engineering\
      \ weapon system, the Advanced Plasma Rifle v24.  Its primary mode is a standard\
      \ rapid-fire plasma weapon.  But the alternate mode beam also serves a multitude\
      \ of engineering uses on the battlefield, from repairing friendly vehicles to\
      \ constructing power Nodes.  The beam lens incorporates IFF detection, so that\
      \ its dynamic energy matrix automatically switches to a deadly plasma stream\
      \ when contacting an enemy vehicle or soldier.  Contact with a friendly target\
      \ switches to a harmless carrier stream, offloading energy from the onboard\
      \ cells to the target.  This boosts the output of any teammate who is linked\
      \ to the rifle -- hence its nickname, the \"Link Gun\".</i>\n</p><p>Players\
      \ wanting to combine the power of their Link Guns simply move closer together\
      \ to create a kind of \"power grid\". Power boosts are received automatically\
      \ from any nearby equipped Link Gun and any of its own links. A simple power\
      \ grid with only one other Link gun boosts beam and projectile damage by 50%.\
      \ If the grid contains at least two other Link Guns, beam damage output is doubled.\
      \ Link Gun power grids with more participants only make the grid more reliable,\
      \ but do not provide further damage boosting. The maximum distance between two\
      \ players for establishing a link is 160 UU, but Link Guns \"route\" their linked\
      \ power to all other Link Guns, so not all players have to stay within that\

    text: "The '''Pulse Gun''' is a weapon in [[Unreal Tournament]]. The Pulse Gun\
      \ is replaced by the similar '''Link Gun''' in [[UT2003]], [[UT2004]] and [[UT3]].\
      \ In [[Unreal Championship]], it is called The Link. All of the weapons have\
      \ their unique appearances.\n\nThe Pulse Gun's primary fire launches plasma\
      \ projectiles at a rapid rate, and its secondary fire shoots a constant beam\
      \ of plasma, though this beam is of limited length. The Link Gun is different\
      \ from the Pulse Gun only in that a player may \"link up\" with a teammate who\
      \ also has the Link Gun, by firing the beam at the teammate, boosting the teammate's\
      \ firepower; the new name reflects this feature. Multiple players can link up\
      \ to create a chain or any other (acyclic) arrangement of links for a greater\
      \ boost.\n\n== Unreal Tournament ==\n{{Infobox_Weapon|\nPulse Gun (UT)|Image:Ut_w5.jpg|A\
      \ Pulse Gun.|\n; Primary fire\n: Type: Projectile\n: Damage: 30\n: Fire rate:\
      \ 6.1/s\n; Secondary fire\n: Type: Hitscan\n: Damage: ~108/s\n:(see \"The Saw\
      \ Effect\")\n: Ammo drain: 4.58/s\n: Range: 810uu\n; Ammunition\n: Weapon pickup:\
      \ 60\n: Ammo pickup: 25\n: Maximum: 199\n\n}}\nClassification: Plasma Rifle\n\
      === Primary fire ===\nThe Pulse Gun's primary fire projectiles are fast-moving\
      \ green orbs of plasma. It can be quite dangerous in close range fights, long\
      \ range spamming or when retreating around corners, due to its fast fire rate\
      \ compare to other projectiles weapon in UT.\n=== Secondary fire ===\nA bolt\
      \ of green plasma lightning is expelled with limited length. However, it is\
      \ much more effective at medium range than the primary fire, owing to its [[hitscan]]\
      \ nature and [[lockdown]] effect, which prevents players from being able to\
      \ dodge nor jump away.\n==== The \"Saw Effect\" ====\n[[Image:Pulse_beam-segments.jpg|right|thumb|The\
      \ 10 segments of the pulse beam]]\nThe beam is divided into 10 segments of 81uu\
      \ length. Each of them does a fixed damage of 10 health on first contact with\
      \ the player. So if you move towards an opponent and back away from him you\
      \ are doing a bit more damage than usually. (imagine you got a saw in your hands,\
      \ which you have to move forward and back all the time)\n\nNote that the segments\
      \ 'forget' their last target as soon as you switch to another segment, so the\
      \ ''10 damage on 1st contact always refreshes''. That`s why the best method\
      \ is to ''switch fast between 2 segments'', but you'd have to know the exact\
      \ segment borders which are difficult to see. But theoretically you could do\
      \ an ''insane amount of damage'' with this method.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Unreal Tournament\

      \ pickup: 40\n: Ammo pickup: 30\n: Maximum: 120\n}}\n=== Primary fire ===\n\
      The Link Gun's primary fire projectiles are normally green, and while their\
      \ initial speed is slower than that of a [[Rocket Launcher|rocket]], they speed\
      \ up to four times that in under a second. The usefulness of the primary fire\
      \ is generally limited to close-to-medium range, since their slow initial speed\
      \ makes them easy to react to at longer range. However, with a fire rate of\
      \ 5.5 shots per second with 30 damage per shot, at close range and especially\
      \ against unmoving targets the Link Gun primary fire is one of the deadliest\
      \ weapons considering its raw damage rate (165 damage per second).\n=== Secondary\
      \ fire ===\nThe secondary fire tends to be more used than the primary fire.\
      \ Though the green wiggly beam is of limited length, since the beam is [[hitscan]]\
      \ it is far more reliable within its range. 5.5 times a second the beam checks\
      \ for a hit, and will do 15 damage to a target, which comes out to be 82.5 damage\
      \ per second. While it can be hard to master, in the right hands the beam is\
      \ more deadly than the primary fire, especially considering its lockdown effect:\
      \ whenever the beam hits, it pushes the target slightly, making it difficult\
      \ for the target to dodge out of the way, effectively locking the player down.\n\
      === Linking ===\nIf a teammate is linked up to you, the teammate's link beam\
      \ assumes the color of the team, and both the primary and secondary fire of\
      \ your Link Gun become yellow and do extra damage. If there are ''n'' people\
      \ linked up to you, the damage on the primary fire is multiplied by 1 + ''n'',\
      \ and the damage on the secondary fire is multiplied by 1 + (0.5 &times; ''n'').\
      \ For example, if two people are linked up to you, primary fire will do 90 damage\
      \ per shot, and secondary fire will do 30 damage per hit for 165 damage per\
      \ second. The primary projectile speed also increases with the number of links.\n\

      \ Dynamic Weapon Systems combines the best of weapon design in the Advanced\
      \ Plasma Rifle v23, commonly known as the Link Gun, or simply the Link. While\
      \ the primary firing mode of the Link remains the same as its plasma-firing\
      \ predecessor, the secondary cutting torch has been replaced with an active-scanning,\
      \ switchable energy matrix. This matrix enables the weapon to register friend\
      \ or foe upon contact with the swirling green beam and change properties accordingly.\
      \ When the beam comes into contact with an opponent it can inflict serious injury\
      \ and death within seconds. Upon contacting a teammate, it reverts to a harmless\
      \ carrier stream. The carrier stream offloads energy from the onboard cells,\
      \ boosting the output of any targeted player who is also using the Link. Two\
      \ players may Link to one another at any time, boosting the power output of\
      \ the weapon significantly, but it should be noted that while players are boosting\
      \ a teammate, they are unable to defend themselves from attack.|UT2004 manual}}\n\
      As with most UT2003 weapons, the UT2004 version of the Link Gun has remained\
      \ largely the same, though it has received several subtle changes. The Link\
      \ Gun's appearance has been altered. The primary fire now consumes 2 ammo per\
      \ shot, and the secondary fire has a greater fire rate of over 9 hits per second,\
      \ although the damage per hit has been decreased to 9 such that its rate of\
      \ damage has been unchanged. In compensation for the increased ammo consumption\
      \ rate, the ammo capacity of the UT2004 Link Gun has been increased.\n\nIn UT2004,\
      \ players can also repair [[:Category:Vehicles|vehicles]] and [[Onslaught#Power\
      \ Node|Power Nodes]] with the alternate fire, greatly increasing the utility\
      \ of this weapon in [[Onslaught]], [[Vehicle CTF]], and certain [[Assault]]\
      \ maps. The heal amount and speed of most vehicles and turrets can be configured\
      \ by Level Designers, but due to the default settings, generally the speed is\
      \ quite low for the automatic floor and ceiling sentinel turrets in Assault\
      \ maps.\n\nNote that linking up is much more efficient than in UT2003. With\
      \ ''n'' links your primary fire still has a damage multiplier of 1 + ''n'',\
      \ but the beam damage or healing scales up by 1 + (1.5 × ''n''). This basically\
      \ means you can build/heal nodes much faster if you link together instead of\
      \ separately aiming directly at the node. An example: Two players separately\
      \ aiming at the node heal it by 2 × 82.5 = 165 points per second. If one of\
      \ the players linked to the other instead, the combined healing would be (1\
      \ + 1.5) × 82.5 = 206.25 points per second. The same example applies to healing\
      \ vehicles or firing the beam at enemies.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Unreal Tournament\

      \ when healing vehicles or power nodes. When attempting to heal a fully intact\

      \ the info box is a theoretical value. Due to rounding errors after down-scaling\
      \ individual \"health chunks\", the actual healing rate probably is much slower,\
      \ maybe around 5-10/s.\n;Game Description\n''Riordan Dynamic Weapon Systems\
      \ is best known for their all-purpose combat engineering weapon system, the\
      \ Advanced Plasma Rifle v24.  Its primary mode is a standard rapid-fire plasma\
      \ weapon.  But the alternate mode beam also serves a multitude of engineering\
      \ uses on the battlefield, from repairing friendly vehicles to constructing\
      \ power Nodes.  The beam lens incorporates IFF detection, so that its dynamic\
      \ energy matrix automatically switches to a deadly plasma stream when contacting\
      \ an enemy vehicle or soldier.  Contact with a friendly target switches to a\
      \ harmless carrier stream, offloading energy from the onboard cells to the target.\
      \  This boosts the output of any teammate who is linked to the rifle -- hence\
      \ its nickname, the \"Link Gun\".''\n\nPlayers wanting to combine the power\
      \ of their Link Guns simply move closer together to create a kind of \"power\
      \ grid\". Power boosts are received automatically from any nearby equipped Link\
      \ Gun and any of its own links. A simple power grid with only one other Link\
      \ gun boosts beam and projectile damage by 50%. If the grid contains at least\
      \ two other Link Guns, beam damage output is doubled. Link Gun power grids with\
      \ more participants only make the grid more reliable, but do not provide further\
      \ damage boosting. The maximum distance between two players for establishing\
      \ a link is 160 UU, but Link Guns \"route\" their linked power to all other\
      \ Link Guns, so not all players have to stay within that small space.\n{{clear}}\n\
