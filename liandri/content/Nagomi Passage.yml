      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>You start in the hallway you entered at the end of the previous map.\
      \ Ahead lie double doors. Go through the doors and you emerge at the head of\
      \ a night-darkened canyon. There are some inscriptions to either side [1].\n\
      </p><p>Ahead are some obviously out of place <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\"\
      >Skaarj</a> boxes. Go past the boxes; to the right beyond is a <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\"\
      \ title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a> and a wooden crate containing\
      \ a <a href=\"/Rocket_Pack#Unreal\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rocket Pack\"\
      >can of 12 Eightballs</a>. Follow the canyon round; soon you arrive half way\
      \ up the wall of a medium height canyon. Over the other side of the small canyon\
      \ a SkaarjWarrior crouches in the pool of light from a high-tech lamp post on\
      \ a ledge. Beneath you lie the floor of the canyon and a water pool.\n</p><p>Kill\
      \ the Skaarj with your <a href=\"/ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\"\
      >ASMD</a> or a similar weapon. Then, jump down from your raised vantage point;\
      \ try to land in the pool so that you don't take falling damage. In the water,\
      \ kill the two <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a> lurking\
      \ in the corners. You will see some fallen timbers, as if there was once a bridge\
      \ above that has since been destroyed. The bridge was not destroyed in the Unreal\
      \ Beta though.\n</p><p>Climb out of the water and collect the <a href=\"/Stinger\"\
      \ title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> you find at the base of a lamp post there. Shoot\
      \ wooden crates a little further along for a box of 50 Bullets. There are two\
      \ ways you could go from here; up the slope to where the Skaarj was lurking,\
      \ or along the base of the canyon. Stick to the base of the canyon for now and\
      \ walk along it, opening another wooden crate on the way for an ASMD Core.\n\
      As the pool ends, the canyon narrows off. You will see that it opens out ahead;\
      \ go along to the corner where it opens out, then kill a <a href=\"/Brute\"\
      \ title=\"Brute\">Brute</a> on patrol beyond the corner. There, you will see\
      \ an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\"\
      >Assault Vest</a> on top of a box and an ASMD on the ground in the light from\
      \ another lamp post. Collect the ASMD and go behind the lamp post for another\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit. Then, back off a bit and look at the cliff to the left.\
      \ You will see a narrow slope of land that climbs the cliff quite steeply. Don't\
      \ go all the way up it, but use it to gain enough height to drop down to the\
      \ Assault Vest on the box.\nDrop off the box. Ahead up the canyon you will see\
      \ that the left wall of the canyon is interrupted by a large valley. Go to the\
      \ edge and look out over the valley; you will see some kind of small pointed\
      \ roofed building attached to the cliff, a water pool, a Skaarj or two and a\
      \ ledge following the cliff above to the left. Stay in your own small canyon\
      \ for now though.\n</p><p>This canyon carries on, but there's some other stuff\
      \ to attend to first. Do an about turn and go back the way you came. Go past\
      \ the water pool where you dropped down, and start up the curving slope round\
      \ the end of the canyon. At the top, you will find two wooden crates which reveal\
      \ 40 Tarydium Shards, and also a Nali Healing Fruit. You will also see that\
      \ a small pass goes through between boxes to the left. The pass is guarded by\
      \ a Brute - kill the Brute then follow the pass; between the boxes, you will\
      \ find a box of 10 Flak Shells and also a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"\
      Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a> by a corpse. Read the corpse's log [2].\n</p><p>Continue\
      \ through the pass. Shortly, you will emerge on a plateau above the large valley.\
      \ To the right, wooden crates reveal two cans of 12 Eightballs, and there's\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit nearby. Look at the two exits from the plateau. To the\
      \ right you will find a plank bridge crosses the previous canyon - kill a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ that charges you from the bridge as you investigate. To the left on the plateau\
      \ is the start of the high ledge that runs along the side of the large valley.\
      \ You don't want to go right along the ledge yet, but follow it for part of\
      \ the way. When you come to a recess behind a rock to the left, kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ who ambushes you within then collect an <a href=\"/Eightball_Gun\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Eightball Gun\">Eightball Gun</a> you will find there.\
      \ Open wooden crates as well for two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards.\n</p><p>Return\
      \ back up the ledge to the plateau and go across the plank bridge. At the far\
      \ side, you will find some kind of temple building entrance in the cliff. The\
      \ temple entrance is guarded by two <a href=\"/Spinner\" title=\"Spinner\">Spinners</a>.\
      \ Kill the Spiders then go behind boxes nearby for a box of 50 Bullets. Collect\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit from to the left of the entrance, then investigate the\
      \ entrance itself. Barrels in the entrance area reveal an ASMD Core. If you\
      \ go through the entrance and down the steps, you will find a hefty stone door\
      \ that will not budge. So, emerge from the entrance and return to the great\
      \ outdoors.\n</p><p>From the entrance, a canyon continues downhill. Follow it.\
      \ At the bottom, you will see that you have rejoined the starting canyon just\
      \ beyond the opening to the large valley. You don't want to go back there again,\
      \ so go to the right and follow the next canyon up its slope.\n</p><p>After\
      \ a short stretch of gently sloping canyon, you will reach a ledge above a chasm.\
      \ At the base of the chasm is a water pool - it's not worth going into the water,\
      \ because you'll find nothing useful, so stay on dry land. You'll also see up\
      \ against the cliffs to the right the frontage of some kind of Skaarj installation.\n\
      </p><p>The ledge goes two ways from here. Up to the right, or down to the left.\
      \ The ledges meet up at the far side of the chasm. Take the ledge that goes\
      \ up to the right. At the top, you will pass the wall of the installation. There,\
      \ a SkaarjAssassin is crouched on guard. Kill it. When it is dead, you will\
      \ be able to collect a useful <a href=\"/Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Rifle\">Rifle</a> with a box of 8 Rifle Rounds and two individual Rifle Rounds\
      \ lying on the ground there. Collect the weapon but watch out for a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ that comes running up the ledge ahead. When the Skaarj is dead, look around\
      \ from your high vantage point.\n</p><p>From here you get a good view of the\
      \ ledge below. Directly beneath you, you can see a metal bridge that crosses\
      \ the chasm to a door in the cliff below. A Brute is guarding the bridge. Use\
      \ the rifle to kill the Brute, then proceed down the ledge and follow it round\
      \ on to the ledge below to investigate. You will pass another canyon entrance\
      \ on the way that you will be coming back to afterwards.\n</p><p>Note: If you\
      \ accidentally fall into the water, there's a lift in the middle of the pool\
      \ that will take you back up to the bridge.\n</p><p>Some Skaarj boxes are located\
      \ on the ledge just beyond the bridge. Approach them. You will pass a corpse\
      \ with an <a href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a>\
      \ and two Clips, then retrieve an ASMD Core and a can of 12 Eightballs from\
      \ by the boxes themselves. Read the corpse's log [3].\n</p><p>Investigate the\
      \ entrance; cross the bridge. At the far side you will find that the entrance\
      \ is blocked by bars. So, return across the bridge and make a right, heading\
      \ for the canyon entrance you have not yet explored. Enter the canyon. Follow\
      \ it round a corner to the left (there's a Nali Healing Fruit near this corner\
      \ if you need it). Shortly, you will find yourself back at the large valley\
      \ with the small pointed-roofed building in it, but at the far end from where\
      \ you saw it from before. At this end, a slope leads down into the valley. Follow\
      \ it to the land below.\n</p><p>At the bottom of the ramp you arrive opposite\
      \ the doors of the small pointed-roofed temple entrance building. Disregarding\
      \ the entrance for now, make a hard right and double back past the ramp. Kill\
      \ a SkaarjWarrior lurking behind boxes in the corner to gain access to two Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit nearby. Go back up the valley past the temple entrance again,\
      \ and kill the SkaarjAssassin you find at the far end beyond the water pool.\
      \ Once it is dead, you can collect another Nali Healing Fruit from behind its\
      \ boxes. One last thing to do before leaving; from this end of the valley, go\
      \ behind the temple entrance building. You will find two more Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ in a corner.\n</p><p>All done now, so approach the structure. Go through the\
      \ doors in the front to reveal a tunnel of steps going downwards. Descend the\
      \ steps and go through the large gold door at the bottom to exit the level.\n\

      \ map in [[Unreal - Return to Na Pali|Unreal - Return to Na Pali's]] single\

      \ You're still on the run. Escaping from the Spire Valley intact, you arrive\
      \ in the sacred land of Nagomi - a moonlit network of canyons and valleys that\
      \ have been defiled by the Skaarj and their minions.\n{{clear}}\n==Weapons and\

      \ completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on\
      \ other difficulty settings.''\n\nYou start in the hallway you entered at the\
      \ end of the previous map. Ahead lie double doors. Go through the doors and\
      \ you emerge at the head of a night-darkened canyon. There are some inscriptions\
      \ to either side [1].\n\nAhead are some obviously out of place [[Skaarj]] boxes.\
      \ Go past the boxes; to the right beyond is a [[Nali Healing Fruit]] and a wooden\
      \ crate containing a [[Rocket_Pack#Unreal|can of 12 Eightballs]]. Follow the\
      \ canyon round; soon you arrive half way up the wall of a medium height canyon.\
      \ Over the other side of the small canyon a SkaarjWarrior crouches in the pool\
      \ of light from a high-tech lamp post on a ledge. Beneath you lie the floor\
      \ of the canyon and a water pool.\n\nKill the Skaarj with your [[ASMD]] or a\
      \ similar weapon. Then, jump down from your raised vantage point; try to land\
      \ in the pool so that you don't take falling damage. In the water, kill the\
      \ two [[Devilfish]] lurking in the corners. You will see some fallen timbers,\
      \ as if there was once a bridge above that has since been destroyed. The bridge\
      \ was not destroyed in the Unreal Beta though.\n\nClimb out of the water and\
      \ collect the [[Stinger]] you find at the base of a lamp post there. Shoot wooden\
      \ crates a little further along for a box of 50 Bullets. There are two ways\
      \ you could go from here; up the slope to where the Skaarj was lurking, or along\
      \ the base of the canyon. Stick to the base of the canyon for now and walk along\
      \ it, opening another wooden crate on the way for an ASMD Core.\nAs the pool\
      \ ends, the canyon narrows off. You will see that it opens out ahead; go along\
      \ to the corner where it opens out, then kill a [[Brute]] on patrol beyond the\
      \ corner. There, you will see an [[Assault Vest]] on top of a box and an ASMD\
      \ on the ground in the light from another lamp post. Collect the ASMD and go\
      \ behind the lamp post for another Nali Healing Fruit. Then, back off a bit\
      \ and look at the cliff to the left. You will see a narrow slope of land that\
      \ climbs the cliff quite steeply. Don't go all the way up it, but use it to\
      \ gain enough height to drop down to the Assault Vest on the box.\nDrop off\
      \ the box. Ahead up the canyon you will see that the left wall of the canyon\
      \ is interrupted by a large valley. Go to the edge and look out over the valley;\
      \ you will see some kind of small pointed roofed building attached to the cliff,\
      \ a water pool, a Skaarj or two and a ledge following the cliff above to the\
      \ left. Stay in your own small canyon for now though.\n\nThis canyon carries\
      \ on, but there's some other stuff to attend to first. Do an about turn and\
      \ go back the way you came. Go past the water pool where you dropped down, and\
      \ start up the curving slope round the end of the canyon. At the top, you will\
      \ find two wooden crates which reveal 40 Tarydium Shards, and also a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit. You will also see that a small pass goes through between boxes to the\
      \ left. The pass is guarded by a Brute - kill the Brute then follow the pass;\
      \ between the boxes, you will find a box of 10 Flak Shells and also a [[Flak\
      \ Cannon]] by a corpse. Read the corpse's log [2].\n\nContinue through the pass.\
      \ Shortly, you will emerge on a plateau above the large valley. To the right,\
      \ wooden crates reveal two cans of 12 Eightballs, and there's a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit nearby. Look at the two exits from the plateau. To the right you will\
      \ find a plank bridge crosses the previous canyon - kill a SkaarjWarrior that\
      \ charges you from the bridge as you investigate. To the left on the plateau\
      \ is the start of the high ledge that runs along the side of the large valley.\
      \ You don't want to go right along the ledge yet, but follow it for part of\
      \ the way. When you come to a recess behind a rock to the left, kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ who ambushes you within then collect an [[Eightball Gun]] you will find there.\
      \ Open wooden crates as well for two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards.\n\nReturn\
      \ back up the ledge to the plateau and go across the plank bridge. At the far\
      \ side, you will find some kind of temple building entrance in the cliff. The\
      \ temple entrance is guarded by two [[Spinner]]s. Kill the Spiders then go behind\
      \ boxes nearby for a box of 50 Bullets. Collect a Nali Healing Fruit from to\
      \ the left of the entrance, then investigate the entrance itself. Barrels in\
      \ the entrance area reveal an ASMD Core. If you go through the entrance and\
      \ down the steps, you will find a hefty stone door that will not budge. So,\
      \ emerge from the entrance and return to the great outdoors.\n\nFrom the entrance,\
      \ a canyon continues downhill. Follow it. At the bottom, you will see that you\
      \ have rejoined the starting canyon just beyond the opening to the large valley.\
      \ You don't want to go back there again, so go to the right and follow the next\
      \ canyon up its slope.\n\nAfter a short stretch of gently sloping canyon, you\
      \ will reach a ledge above a chasm. At the base of the chasm is a water pool\
      \ - it's not worth going into the water, because you'll find nothing useful,\
      \ so stay on dry land. You'll also see up against the cliffs to the right the\
      \ frontage of some kind of Skaarj installation.\n\nThe ledge goes two ways from\
      \ here. Up to the right, or down to the left. The ledges meet up at the far\
      \ side of the chasm. Take the ledge that goes up to the right. At the top, you\
      \ will pass the wall of the installation. There, a SkaarjAssassin is crouched\
      \ on guard. Kill it. When it is dead, you will be able to collect a useful [[Rifle]]\
      \ with a box of 8 Rifle Rounds and two individual Rifle Rounds lying on the\
      \ ground there. Collect the weapon but watch out for a SkaarjWarrior that comes\
      \ running up the ledge ahead. When the Skaarj is dead, look around from your\
      \ high vantage point.\n\nFrom here you get a good view of the ledge below. Directly\
      \ beneath you, you can see a metal bridge that crosses the chasm to a door in\
      \ the cliff below. A Brute is guarding the bridge. Use the rifle to kill the\
      \ Brute, then proceed down the ledge and follow it round on to the ledge below\
      \ to investigate. You will pass another canyon entrance on the way that you\
      \ will be coming back to afterwards.\n\nNote: If you accidentally fall into\
      \ the water, there's a lift in the middle of the pool that will take you back\
      \ up to the bridge.\n\nSome Skaarj boxes are located on the ledge just beyond\
      \ the bridge. Approach them. You will pass a corpse with an [[Automag]] and\
      \ two Clips, then retrieve an ASMD Core and a can of 12 Eightballs from by the\
      \ boxes themselves. Read the corpse's log [3].\n\nInvestigate the entrance;\
      \ cross the bridge. At the far side you will find that the entrance is blocked\
      \ by bars. So, return across the bridge and make a right, heading for the canyon\
      \ entrance you have not yet explored. Enter the canyon. Follow it round a corner\
      \ to the left (there's a Nali Healing Fruit near this corner if you need it).\
      \ Shortly, you will find yourself back at the large valley with the small pointed-roofed\
      \ building in it, but at the far end from where you saw it from before. At this\
      \ end, a slope leads down into the valley. Follow it to the land below.\n\n\
      At the bottom of the ramp you arrive opposite the doors of the small pointed-roofed\
      \ temple entrance building. Disregarding the entrance for now, make a hard right\
      \ and double back past the ramp. Kill a SkaarjWarrior lurking behind boxes in\
      \ the corner to gain access to two Nali Healing Fruit nearby. Go back up the\
      \ valley past the temple entrance again, and kill the SkaarjAssassin you find\
      \ at the far end beyond the water pool. Once it is dead, you can collect another\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit from behind its boxes. One last thing to do before leaving;\
      \ from this end of the valley, go behind the temple entrance building. You will\
      \ find two more Nali Healing Fruit in a corner.\n\nAll done now, so approach\
      \ the structure. Go through the doors in the front to reveal a tunnel of steps\
      \ going downwards. Descend the steps and go through the large gold door at the\
      \ bottom to exit the level.\n\n== Translator Messages ==\n# \"Entering Land\
      \ of Nagomi\"\n#\"LOG: A. Leiby: Been running from a Skaarj for the past 2 hours.\
      \ Think I lost him behind a crate. If I can just make it down below I can slip\

      \n== Intermission ==\nThe scene cuts to an intermission with a view of the temple\
      \ entrance building. The player records a log entry.\n\n{{QuoteSource|The trek\
      \ to the other shuttle has become a real endurance test. I don't have much to\

      \ the next level.\n\n== Trivia ==\n*This map was changed from the Unreal Beta\
      \ version, but still acts as the only two-way hub level in Return to Na Pali\
      \ - you return after passing one level to gain access to another. In Unreal\
      \ Beta, Nagomi was a six-way hub though.\n\n\n{{prevnext|Spire Valley|Velora\
