    text: "<p>Umm, about that 'Additional Info' section...  UT2004 netcode didn't\
      \ really improve anything, it just made it different.  It allowed for 32 players\
      \ + vehakals, but due to all the bandwidth \"optimizations\" it worsened support\
      \ for low player counts such as 1v1 matches.  1v1 servers often run at twice\
      \ the default tick rate (or higher) because of how terrible the netcode feels\
      \ in such a situation.  The default tick is 20 or 25 (I can't remember which),\
      \ and the community has a self-mandated rule that all competitive matches much\
      \ be played at 35 tick or high.  1v1 servers are often 40-50 tick and there\
      \ have been some at 60-70 through the years.  Certainly this is proof that UT2004\

      \  The sniper rifle, AVRiL, grenade launcher, and mine launcher are all featured\

      \ that's what's given in LMS. In some maps (Mostly ONS ones) You can pick up\
      \ AVRiLs, Grenade Launchers, and Mine Layers, which by your arguement, makes\
      \ them just as standard. If you REALLY want to get standard, the Shield Gun\
      \ and Assault Rifle are the only two weapons given in every gametype, and everything\
      \ else must be picked up... excepting LMS. There really is no good point for\
      \ \"standard\" weapons because LMS is an exception... not the rule. --<a href=\"\

    text: "Umm, about that 'Additional Info' section...  UT2004 netcode didn't really\
      \ improve anything, it just made it different.  It allowed for 32 players +\
      \ vehakals, but due to all the bandwidth \"optimizations\" it worsened support\
      \ for low player counts such as 1v1 matches.  1v1 servers often run at twice\
      \ the default tick rate (or higher) because of how terrible the netcode feels\
      \ in such a situation.  The default tick is 20 or 25 (I can't remember which),\
      \ and the community has a self-mandated rule that all competitive matches much\
      \ be played at 35 tick or high.  1v1 servers are often 40-50 tick and there\
      \ have been some at 60-70 through the years.  Certainly this is proof that UT2004\
      \ netcode is '''not''' better, right? -- [[User:T2A`|T2A`]] 17:31, 21 July 2007\
      \ (EDT)\n\nI'm not sure. It's somewhat confusing either way and perhaps needs\
      \ to be spelled out what the difference actually was. The problem is that the\
      \ netcode was \"improved\" but it was only done so for what Epic must have felt\
      \ was the \"sweet spot\", aka 8-24 players. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 01:11,\
      \ 22 July 2007 (EDT)\n\nI just re-worded it to remove subjective language about\
      \ \"better\" and \"worse\" and stuck to the functional improvement of the netcode:\
      \ vehicles and player count.  --[[User:W0rf|W0rf]] 11:47, 22 July 2007 (EDT)\n\
      \nThere was already some information about the ECE in the releases section.\
      \  I think it might work better separate from that though.  Then there could\
      \ just be a link to the later section in the releases area.  --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]]\
      \ 00:28, 24 July 2007 (EDT)\n\nSystem Requirements should probably be under\
      \ Additional Information. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 00:42, 24 July 2007\
      \ (EDT)\n\nThere was never a \"single DVD\" release in the US, thus that release\
      \ detail needs a bit more detail. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 00:05, 30 July\
      \ 2007 (EDT)\n\nhey, under the Engine section where it lists additional middlware\
      \ engines...why is SpeedTree there? I don't recall it ever being used in UT2004.\
      \ I know it was integrated into the engine but it wasn't used with UT2004.--[[User:Torvec|Torvec]]\
      \ 18:28, 30 July 2007 (EDT)\n\nI'm not sure. I thought some of the trees in\
      \ ONS maps were done by speedtree. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 18:42, 30\
      \ July 2007 (EDT)\n\nNope, SpeedTree is a technology for generating trees and\
      \ rendering them. UT2004 only uses static mesh trees. --[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]]\

      \ both of them do. I don't know why the prefix was missing earlier, since the\
      \ filenames clearly have them. --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]] 20:41, 28 April\
      \ 2008 (EDT)\n\n== Standard weapons? ==\nI'm not sure what the point of listing\
      \ certain weapons as 'standard' is.  The sniper rifle, AVRiL, grenade launcher,\
      \ and mine launcher are all featured in lots of stock maps across two gametypes.\
      \  In the case of the sniper rifle, it exists in some stock CTF/DM maps as well.\
      \  The superweapons are also widely featured, so I'm not sure why they should\
      \ be considered separate either.  Some of the others, like the translocator,\
      \ ball launcher, and super shock rifle could be separated out.  If we did want\
      \ to separate them out though, it should just be a single divided list, not\
      \ two lists right next to each other. – [[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 07:54, 5 May 2008\
      \ (EDT)\n:{{support}} Though I think that there should be one list and notes\
      \ near the non-standard ones. For example:\n\n{| width=\"100%\" class=\"list\"\
      \n|\n* [[Translocator]]\n* [[Shield Gun]]\n* [[Assault Rifle]]\n* [[Bio Rifle]]\n\
      * [[Shock Rifle]]\n* [[Link Gun]]\n* [[Minigun]]\n* [[Flak Cannon]]\n|\n* [[Rocket\
      \ Launcher]]\n* [[Lightning Gun]] (In some maps replaced by the [[Sniper Rifle]])\n\
      * [[Sniper Rifle]] (In some maps replaced by the [[Lightning Gun]])\n* [[Redeemer]]\
      \ (Super weapon)\n* [[Ion Painter]] (Super weapon)\n* [[Target Painter]] (Super\
      \ weapon)\n|\n* [[Mine Layer]] (Usually only in [[Assault]] and [[Onslaught]])\n\
      * [[Grenade Launcher]] (Usually only in [[Assault]] and [[Onslaught]])\n* [[AVRiL]](Usually\
      \ only in [[Assault]] and [[Onslaught]])\n* [[Instagib|Super Shock Rifle]] (Only\
      \ when [[Instagib]] mutator is enabled)\n* [[Ball Launcher]] (Only in [[Bombing\
      \ Run]])\n|}\nNot a very nice-looking list, but something like that. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\

      \ redundant, and so on that basis it has my {{support}}. --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark\

      \ 09:57, 6 May 2008 (EDT) </small>\n:::<small>{{comment}} LMS is just one game\
      \ mode of many. Just because that's what's given in LMS doesn't make them \"\
      standard\"... it simply means that's what's given in LMS. In some maps (Mostly\
      \ ONS ones) You can pick up AVRiLs, Grenade Launchers, and Mine Layers, which\
      \ by your arguement, makes them just as standard. If you REALLY want to get\
      \ standard, the Shield Gun and Assault Rifle are the only two weapons given\
      \ in every gametype, and everything else must be picked up... excepting LMS.\
      \ There really is no good point for \"standard\" weapons because LMS is an exception...\

      \ a section for 'normal' weapons, one for super weapons, and one for utility/gametype\
      \ (TL, ball launcher) weapons would be reasonable.  Super shock doesn't fit\

      \ were, how many UT2003 maps there were and the number of total maps there were.\
      \ The best way to do this would be to install UT2004 retail and see which maps\

      \ UT2003 Maps ==\n\nNotice: the text says all Ut2003 maps are in 2004 as well.\
      \ This isn't true. CTF-DE-LavaGiant2 was not put into UT2004 - I heard it had\
      \ problems. DM-Curse3 wasn't put in either, but at least that was upgraded to\

      \ 14:24, 24 May 2009 (EDT)\n\n:No, it says ''almost'' all UT2003 maps made it\
      \ to UT2004, which is true. There are a few stories about why Lavagiant wasn't\
      \ included. An Epic rep. stated that it had too many bsp holes, while J.P. Eekels\
      \ (the author) said that Epic didn't see his design strategy (large map with\

      \ Bonus Packs and maps are considered canon for the Unreal Universe as a whole,\
      \ what about the BP2 maps? Acatana, Jumpship, SubRosa, Thrust... should the\
      \ characters, timelines, team pages and corporation pages be updated with info\
      \ from these descriptions, despite that these were created as custom content\
      \ and later added as official content?\n\nFor example, including info from AS-BP2-Jumpship\
      \ (an Izanagi attack on Liandri space) on both Izanagi and Liandri pages, or\
      \ the N.E.G. assault on Liandri HQ on Subrosa on both N.E.G. and Liandri pages.\n\
      \nWhat do you think?--[[User:Neon Knight|Neon Knight]] 20:50, 8 October 2009\

      \ —[[User:Wormbo|Wormbo]] 04:27, 9 October 2009 (EDT)\n\n:It's probably safe\
