      \ a lot better. I was confuzzled for a while about the selection of information\
      \ (why the table includes the health vials' locations, but not those of the\
      \ health packs), but now I see that's what the map is for. It might be handy\
      \ to mention that for the rest of the locations one should look at the map,\
      \ for retards like me --<a href=\"/User:Kaithofis\" title=\"User:Kaithofis\"\
      >Kaithofis</a> 07:10, 6 November 2007 (EST)\n</p><p>Well, not all maps have\
      \ image maps to go along with them.  But items are of difference importance.\
      \  Health packs aren't a huge point of interest, but vials might be more important\
      \ because they get you over 100.  Mainly though, I was just copying the information\
      \ that was on the page to begin with.  It can be adjusted as needed. --<a href=\"\
      /User:Haarg\" title=\"User:Haarg\">Haarg</a> 13:16, 6 November 2007 (EST)\n\
      </p><p>On the contrary, I think the location of health packs are pretty important.\
      \ Sure, after you play the level awhile you know where everything is, but having\
      \ some entries filled out but not others makes the table look incomplete. Plus,\
      \ it'll help new players who don't know the map be able to quickly find health\
      \ under fire, assuming they remember where it is. Adrenaline might not be so\
      \ important, since it isn't in any games other than 2kx (And UC2, albeit implemented\
      \ far differently) and plus not too many servers even have it on, anyway. --<a\
      \ href=\"/User:Dark_Pulse\" title=\"User:Dark Pulse\">Dark Pulse</a> 00:17,\
      \ 9 November 2007 (EST)\n</p><p>I agree with DP's point and his reasoning. In\
      \ some cases Health Packs are more important than the vials that only give you\
      \ 1 health, even if they do get you 100+. It all depends on the situation. <a\
      \ href=\"/User:Retodon8\" title=\"User:Retodon8\">Retodon8</a> 23:29, 9 November\
      \ 2007 (EST)\n</p><p>I don't disagree, but I would say in the case of Deck where\
      \ there the vials are in clusters I would say they are more important than normal\
      \ health packs.  It really depends on the level.  If we did want to go into\
      \ full detail on every pickup though, this structure might not work the best.\
      \  Any thoughts on how to improve it for that? --<a href=\"/User:Haarg\" title=\"\

      \ \"Weapon's Location\" too, as now it's unclear whether you are talking about\
      \ the weapon's location or that of the ammo. Now on the subject of what people\
      \ are coming here for: I try to write my articles so that people who've never\
      \ played the map will have a good idea of what to do. I'd say that the weapon\

      \ understand that, the user needs to know where the rl/dd is...\nApart from\
      \ that I doubt anyone can remember all the locations of the weapons by reading\
      \ it.\nHow about this: The tables just show the pickups/weapons (and ammo) and\
      \ their count. For the location a picture is used, just like it is already on\
      \ this page, maybe more detailed. If it isn't clear how the reach something\

      \ this before Awaw's post: In this case, the notes section is somewhat wasted,\
      \ but that's because there's only really one weapon that's out of the way or\
      \ not obvious.  And if there were no notes, the space would be wasted anyway.\
      \  You aren't going to be able to play a map well without walking around it\
      \ first, and doing that you will find where the weapons are anyway.  If you\
      \ can't remember where the weapons are from that, I don't think text instructions\
      \ will help.  Additionally, describing weapon locations is usually awkward.\
      \  You can't use directions like left or right, nor compass points.  Pickups\
      \ are easier to describe usually because you can reference the nearby weapons.\
      \  That's all mostly irrelevant though.  If people want to add descriptions\
      \ of weapon locations, I don't have a problem with it.  I'm more concerned with\
      \ creating a layout that will work for all pages if possible.  Are there any\

      \ are people's thoughts on something a bit more structured like this for item\
      \ listings? --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 16:07, 5 November 2007 (EST)\n\nHaving had\
      \ no interest in including that information ont he map pages, I actually like\
      \ that and would like to see it on map pages. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]]\
      \ 18:28, 5 November 2007 (EST)\n\nDefinitely looks a lot better. I was confuzzled\
      \ for a while about the selection of information (why the table includes the\
      \ health vials' locations, but not those of the health packs), but now I see\
      \ that's what the map is for. It might be handy to mention that for the rest\
      \ of the locations one should look at the map, for retards like me --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]]\
      \ 07:10, 6 November 2007 (EST)\n\nWell, not all maps have image maps to go along\
      \ with them.  But items are of difference importance.  Health packs aren't a\
      \ huge point of interest, but vials might be more important because they get\
      \ you over 100.  Mainly though, I was just copying the information that was\
      \ on the page to begin with.  It can be adjusted as needed. --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]]\
      \ 13:16, 6 November 2007 (EST)\n\nOn the contrary, I think the location of health\
      \ packs are pretty important. Sure, after you play the level awhile you know\
      \ where everything is, but having some entries filled out but not others makes\
      \ the table look incomplete. Plus, it'll help new players who don't know the\
      \ map be able to quickly find health under fire, assuming they remember where\
      \ it is. Adrenaline might not be so important, since it isn't in any games other\
      \ than 2kx (And UC2, albeit implemented far differently) and plus not too many\
      \ servers even have it on, anyway. --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark Pulse]] 00:17, 9\
      \ November 2007 (EST)\n\nI agree with DP's point and his reasoning. In some\
      \ cases Health Packs are more important than the vials that only give you 1\
      \ health, even if they do get you 100+. It all depends on the situation. [[User:Retodon8|Retodon8]]\
      \ 23:29, 9 November 2007 (EST)\n\nI don't disagree, but I would say in the case\
      \ of Deck where there the vials are in clusters I would say they are more important\
      \ than normal health packs.  It really depends on the level.  If we did want\
      \ to go into full detail on every pickup though, this structure might not work\
      \ the best.  Any thoughts on how to improve it for that? --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]]\
      \ 21:47, 10 November 2007 (EST)\n\nWhat about something like this:\n\n{| class=\"\
      wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 88%; margin: 0;\"\n|-\n! Pickup !! Count !! Notes\n\
      |-\n| [[Health Vial]] Group 1 || 5 || Between two crates near the upper [[Flak\

      \ 5 || 3 || Ramp leading to the lava room, approximately between the [[Sniper\

      \ Doorway leading to the lava room from the [[Bio Rifle]]\n|-\n| [[Double Damage]]\

      \ amounts, we split them into groups if possible, since it's pretty rare to\
      \ see just one health vial or one adrenaline pill in a general area.\n\nYeah,\
      \ it's a bit longer and perhaps over-informative to some, but I think that it's\
      \ plenty of information, especially if we paired it up with maps and/or pictures.\
      \ --[[User:Dark Pulse|Dark Pulse]] 04:20, 11 November 2007 (EST)\n\nI think\
      \ that's a bit overkill.  Pickup locations are something you'll have to figure\
      \ out while playing anyway, so I think limiting placement descriptions to items\
      \ that are out of the way or of particular importance (super shield, amp) would\
      \ be better.  I'd also rather have something small enough that the pickup and\
      \ weapon boxes can be placed next to each other as in my example, although the\
      \ placement of the blank space isn't ideal.  I'm fine with including more information\
      \ that I did initially; as I said, I was just copying what is currently on the\
      \ page.  But including a complete description of every item's location is pointless\
      \ in my opinion.  --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 19:26, 1 February 2008 (EST)\n\nI agree\
      \ that mentioning the locations of smaller pickups (even if it's in groups)\
      \ and ammunition is a bit too much.\nHowever, I think that it would be useful\
      \ to include the locations for the weapons. Personally I see more use for that\
      \ than for the ammo count from the 1st example. Other than that I think that\
      \ the 1st set of tables looks very good. Maybe the health/shieldpack's locations\
      \ should be given instead of the ones of health vials, but I haven't played\
      \ enough to know which of the items are most important in combat, so I'll leave\
      \ that up to others to decide --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]] 20:00, 1 February\
      \ 2008 (EST)\n\nIn my opinion there really is no need to describe every little\
      \ (or not so little) item including it's location. Who's gonna come to Liandri\
      \ Archive just to find out where all of the Health Vials are located? I doubt\
      \ anybody will. In my opinion the only interesting point of view - if any -\
      \ is the statistical one. For example when looking at VCTF-Suspense you could\
      \ see there are only two Avril pickups and zero ammo, leading to the conclusion\
      \ the mapper wanted to keep the Avril use down.\nIMHO the only items with a\
      \ place description should be the hidden or special (dd, redeemer, supershock,\
      \ super health, etc.) ones. --[[User:Awaw|Awaw]] 18:56, 2 February 2008 (EST)\n\
      \nRevised my chart at the top.  Any criticisms layout wise?  The amount of details\
      \ can vary from map to map. Also, isn't there only 1 link gun on this map? --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]]\
      \ 19:38, 2 February 2008 (EST)\n\nIf you're going to give the location of a\
      \ weapon, you might as well give them all. Right now the notes section is a\
      \ big waste of space apart from the last row. I'd replace \"Notes\" with \"\
      Weapon's Location\" too, as now it's unclear whether you are talking about the\
      \ weapon's location or that of the ammo. Now on the subject of what people are\
      \ coming here for: I try to write my articles so that people who've never played\
      \ the map will have a good idea of what to do. I'd say that the weapon locations\
      \ are crucial for that. It's the first thing you'll need after spawning and\
      \ a good knowledge of these locations will win you the match. --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]]\
      \ 07:38, 3 February 2008 (EST)\n\nI kinda agree on your layout criticism.\n\
      But how are you gonna describe the locations of the weapons? Let's say the Flak\
      \ in Deck - Between the rocket launcher and the dd, below on a little platform?\
      \ But in order to understand that, the user needs to know where the rl/dd is...\n\
      Apart from that I doubt anyone can remember all the locations of the weapons\
      \ by reading it.\nHow about this: The tables just show the pickups/weapons (and\
      \ ammo) and their count. For the location a picture is used, just like it is\
      \ already on this page, maybe more detailed. If it isn't clear how the reach\
      \ something in the first place (redeemer), an explaining sentence is added.\
      \ --[[User:Awaw|Awaw]] 08:53, 3 February 2008 (EST)\n\nWrote this before Awaw's\
      \ post: In this case, the notes section is somewhat wasted, but that's because\
      \ there's only really one weapon that's out of the way or not obvious.  And\
      \ if there were no notes, the space would be wasted anyway.  You aren't going\
      \ to be able to play a map well without walking around it first, and doing that\
      \ you will find where the weapons are anyway.  If you can't remember where the\
      \ weapons are from that, I don't think text instructions will help.  Additionally,\
      \ describing weapon locations is usually awkward.  You can't use directions\
      \ like left or right, nor compass points.  Pickups are easier to describe usually\
      \ because you can reference the nearby weapons.  That's all mostly irrelevant\
      \ though.  If people want to add descriptions of weapon locations, I don't have\
      \ a problem with it.  I'm more concerned with creating a layout that will work\
      \ for all pages if possible.  Are there any obvious problems with what I have?\
      \  I'd rather optimize for a medium to low level of detail than have it be ugly\
      \ or less useful because many pages don't have exhaustive detail. --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]]\
      \ 09:00, 3 February 2008 (EST)\n\nI definitely don't think the notes column\
      \ as I have it is ideal, but the symmetry with the pickups table makes it work\
      \ OK I think.  I'm not sure of a better way of doing it.  I'd like to provide\
      \ a place to add a small location description like I have for the redeemer where\
      \ that is viable. --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 09:06, 3 February 2008 (EST)\n\nI've\
      \ created a testpage at [[User:Awaw/MapTest]] to view the different possible\
      \ layouts. Please keep in mind that none of these includes the graphical layout\
      \ atm, which would be quite a waste if we wouldn't include it IMHO. --[[User:Awaw|Awaw]]\
      \ 09:39, 3 February 2008 (EST)\n\nI think it's undoubtable that the notes sections\
      \ are needed. Particularly for Super Weapons/Super Pickups, though we could\
      \ potentially just group them under a heading like that. I don't see a purpose\
      \ in telling where anything other than those are since everything else is typically\
      \ in relatively easy to get to places. [[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 13:20, 5\
      \ February 2008 (EST)\n\nI've used [[BR-Icefields]] to try a new template. Comments\
      \ and suggestions are welcome on its talk page. Hopefully we can finally come\
      \ to a plausible solution so that we can finally start on filling in the map\
      \ pages. --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]] 07:34, 8 May 2008 (EDT)\n\n==Ammo==\n\
      Apparently tightly integrated into the above, but for clarity's sake I'll ask\
      \ in a dedicated section: Do we want articles on ammo? [[Special:Wantedpages]]\
      \ currently requests a bunch of ammo types, such as [[Razor Blades]]. It seems\
      \ they are all linked to from map articles, specifically from the pickups template\
      \ discussed above. I don't see the need to describe ammo when there are articles\
      \ on the weapons. Maybe there should be redirects? Otherwise I say the links\
      \ should be piped: \"Ripper|Razor Blades\". [[User:Retodon8|Retodon8]] 12:16,\
