      \ well as the concept, while Harbinger's seats are similar, plus overall feel,\

      \ much less UT3) though to be fair, we know both Izanagi and Axon existed in\

      <p>The problem is, this comparison you are making here is like me saying \"\
      Oh, a Honda compact car is the same as a Honda minivan because they both have\
      \ hatchback and seats and steering wheels!\" There really is no comparison other\
      \ than the most wide generalizations you can make \"The tank seats two\", \"\
      The Harbinger/Bender seat multiple and have an energy weapon in the passenger\
      \ seat\". Those are only similarities to the extent of \"They both have steering\
      \ wheels\" would be. They vehicles look nothing alike and don't even serve similar\
      \ functions. Additionally, the fact that XMP vehicles have boosting capabilities\
      \ simply reinforces that the vehicles are nothing alike. As far as the corporation\
      \ goes, it could be anybody that made them. Unreal 2 takes place 52 or 53 years\
      \ before UT2004, and UT mentions a lot of minor corporations. And there is also\
      \ UXAN as you mentioned in another threads, which is actually a more likely\
      \ candidate than the Axon Corporation. --<a href=\"/User:Sir_Brizz\" title=\"\
      User:Sir Brizz\">Sir Brizz</a> 18:35, 16 May 2008 (EDT)\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Well\
      \ OK, OK, I get the point. Actually, it would be really fun to have the boosting\
      \ ability in UT... And Stamina run boosting... Of course, it's changed to Adrenaline,\
      \ but still. Well, I'll rewrite these into different articles some time, though\
      \ I have lots of work remaining here. --<a href=\"/User:GreatEmerald\" title=\"\
      User:GreatEmerald\">GreatEmerald</a> 02:57, 17 May 2008 (EDT)\n<dl><dd> I agree.\
      \ I love the XMP gameplay. Unfortunately, it never really caught on. Even in\
      \ it's glory days there were only a ffew servers with a few people playing at\
      \ any given time. --<a href=\"/User:Sir_Brizz\" title=\"User:Sir Brizz\">Sir\
      \ Brizz</a> 10:01, 17 May 2008 (EDT)\n<dl><dd> Yeap, exactly. XMP is very similar\
      \ to VCTF (or even slightly to BR, but just because it's similar to CTF) - you\
      \ need to capture the Flag/Artifact/Ball and get it to your Flag/Artifact node/enemy\
      \ hoop. And in both XMP and VCTF bots somehow don't like using vehicles too\
      \ much. What I don't like in XMP is it's U2-style movemnt, that is, dodging\
      \ that is almost like jumping, no double jumps (though XMP has a backpack),\
      \ no Translocator, slow movement... Though I'm now trying to get XMP weapons\
      \ work in usual UT2004 (actually, almost all work by now), and it really feels\
      \ neat. When you get the Shotgun, you know that you are going to own everyone\
      \ around, but you fall under the Magnum Pistol... Actually, they're a bit too\
      \ powerful there as people don't usually have armour on, while in XMP people\
      \ get up to 500 armour, but it's still very interesting, just that you have\
      \ to keep an eye on the moving objects... And in ONS or VCTF they're just excellent.\
      \ I'm going to release it as soon as I figure out how to get a drop-down box\
      \ in Mutator Config page. Hmm, gone quite off-topic, but yea, XMP is somewhat\
      \ unique and really fun. --<a href=\"/User:GreatEmerald\" title=\"User:GreatEmerald\"\
