      <hr />\n<p>Now I wonder about their relationship with Skaarj and Izarians. My\
      \ theory would be this: there are different clans of Skaarj in U1 and U2 (and\
      \ probably UT2004). The first clan likes Krall for soldiers and have different\
      \ social groups: warriors, Assasins, Infantry etc. while the 2nd clan likes\
      \ Izarians and have only 3 classes. The UT2004 clan(s) is(are) very small and\
      \ don't have any social groups (maybe only a Lord and others). So that means\
      \ that Krall and Izarians are simply used by different clans and are both in\
      \ the universe. Wonder what happens if you throw an Izarian and a Krall in one\
      \ pit. Actually, I could check that out depending on their health, fire power\
      \ and speed&#160;:) And what do you think? \n</p><p>Oh, and UT3 section needs\
      \ updating, it still uses future tenses. --<a href=\"/User:GreatEmerald\" title=\"\
      User:GreatEmerald\">GreatEmerald</a> 16:49, 21 May 2008 (EDT)\n</p>\n<dl><dd>That's\
      \ purely conjecture as to which clan likes what - it's entirely possible that\
      \ the Skaarj, which are a large empire, simply can't justify the cost to bring\
      \ Krall in, and so chose Izarians. Plus they're really only seen for the first\
      \ mission - I don't think you run into very many later on in the game, if you\
      \ run into any at all, that is.<br /><br />Agreed about the UT3 section though,\
      \ I'll probably clean it up a bit (if it hasn't been already after I get through\
      \ all the rest of the recent changes.) --<a href=\"/User:Dark_Pulse\" title=\"\
      User:Dark Pulse\">Dark Pulse</a> 06:09, 22 May 2008 (EDT)\n<dl><dd>The fact\
      \ is that there are different clans and the Skaarj have inter-clan wars. I don't\
      \ see anything that would say that Krall have a higher cost... And Izarians\
      \ are in both Sanctuary and Swamp, not later because they are not too strong\
      \ and that Dalton leaves the Skaarj infested worlds. Although another likely\
      \ idea is that Izarians might be Krall, just like gene-boosted or something,\
      \ you can see something familiar in both of those (Staff, crook, movement etc.).\
      \ And don't just say \"No it's not possible\" but state your full version&#160;:P\
