      \ Unreal Engine for some time, and played several custom maps for Unreal and\
      \ Unreal Tournament under Oldskool. Over time, I've managed to acquire skills\
      \ from several large members of the Unreal community as a whole. I started modeling\
      \ a few months ago with Blender, beginning with some simple tutorials for v2.4\
      \ and moving on from those to make my own, which, for those that I presented\
      \ as WIPs online, quickly caught the attention of a few people, in particular\
      \ Mister Prophet, the lead of Team Red Nemesis, and I was offered the chance\
      \ to attempt a weapon model. The model progressed, and at the end of it's development,\
      \ which was followed by Prophet, the weapon was approved as part of the arsenal\
      \ for Residual Decay and I was accepted into the team as modeler under the team's\
      \ lead modeler, Kaka, and have designed further models for both Residual Decay\
      \ and their newer project, Dead Cell. Additionally, I'd been contacted by Delacroix\
      \ to do some weapon models particularly for his Shamu Quest remake, and a few\
      \ other models for the same project. I'd also worked on some test maps and other\
      \ maps, most of which I've now planned as parts of my own personal projects.\
      \ I'm also in the building stages for at least one map for Shivaxi's WTF Series\
      \ 2 sequel.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Personal_Mini-Portfolio\"\
