      \ that Selket would have been an infant at the time of UT3, and UT3 is after\
      \ 2303, so 2315 cannot be correct. --<a href=\"/User:Sir_Brizz\" title=\"User:Sir\

      \ 2320s would be more likely, then... although that would conflict with Malcolm's\

      \ that unreasonable when you take his background into effect, as if he didn't\
      \ have implants, he'd be in his 60s in UC2, whereas I believe it's explicitly\

      \ possible that UT3 only takes place shortly after UT2004, and not years later...\
      \ but even then that'd give a early 2320s date at best, and that's assuming\
