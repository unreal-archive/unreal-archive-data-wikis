    text: "<blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">This scenario is based on an\
      \ infamous episode of a popular Holovision program. In the original episode,\
      \ two teams of mechanics were competing to make their vehicle operational and\
      \ escape the junk yard. The unexpected twist occurred when the losing team pulled\
      \ out some makeshift weapons and pounded the other team into oblivion before\
      \ they could make their escape. Since there was no explicit rule forbidding\
      \ violence in the competition, they were declared the winners, and a new Tournament\
      \ classic was born.</blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 88%;\

      \ nearby. It is their job to delay the attackers as much as they can (by destroying\
      \ the Hellbender or preventing the other team from clearing the road to the\
      \ exit). After one of the obstacles has been cleared, a checkpoint becomes available\
      \ for the attacking team. The team with the fastest time wins.\n</p><p>This\

      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Find\
      \ the Energy Core</dt>\n<dd> Before the attackers can use the Hellbender, they\
      \ first must make it operational. For that, they need the core. There is a large\
      \ clearing outside the attacker's base, with a large metal structure in the\
      \ middle. The core is located on a platform inside that structure. </dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The spawnpoints of the defending team are very close, so they'll be\
      \ waiting for the attackers near the core. The defending team also has a turret\
      \ on a high ledge to the right which overlooks the entire battlefield. This\
      \ turret can be reached quickly with the network of jumppads. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Return\
      \ the Core to the Vehicle</dt>\n<dd> Pick up the core (by walking over it) and\
      \ take it back to the base. When the person carrying the core dies, the core\
      \ will be dropped and someone else from the attacking team can pick it up again.\
      \ When the core is carried into the base the Hellbender is operational.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The defenders will have a <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper\
      \ Rifle\">Sniper Rifle</a>, which can be very effective in this battle. If the\
      \ turret hasn't been taken out yet, then that too still forms a threat to the\
      \ attackers.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Lower the Bridge</dt>\n<dd> Right above the\
      \ attacker's base is a bridge. The problem, however, is that the bridge is open,\
      \ blocking the Hellbender. It's only a small distance from the base though,\
      \ and a player on foot will be there in no-time. When walking out of the base,\
      \ go left (uphill), through the bars and you'll find the switch to lower the\
      \ bridge on the other side of the road. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending team\
      \ has another turret on the sight, which can be really useful for taking down\
      \ the enemy before they can reach the switch. Its view on the switch itself\
      \ is slightly obstructed by a fence and the structure of the bridge. A crouched\
      \ player near the switch can not be shot by the turret. 2 additional healthpack\
      \ next to the turret should help the defenders survive a little longer.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Cross the Bridge</dt>\n<dd> Once the bridge is lowered you will have\
      \ to get the Hellbender across. There are 2 splits in the road from the base\
      \ to the bridge. The left road is the shortest (both times). It's also the least\
      \ safe one, as another turret overlooks that road. You'll also have to jump\
      \ over a fire pit after the 2nd split which may cause up to 200 damage to the\
      \ Hellbender. Make it to the end of the bridge (and onto the white platform)\
      \ for the checkpoint. Your Hellbender will now respawn here instead of back\
      \ at the base.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defenders have 3 turrets to use: the\
      \ one that was mentioned just now, the one from the previous objective, and\
      \ the one from the first 2 objectives. The Hellbender can be followed on foot\
      \ by using the jumppads, so an offense of players on foot can be effective as\
      \ well. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Open the Checkpoint Gate</dt>\n<dd> Just like the\
      \ 3rd Objective: this is one for the players on foot. After having opened the\
      \ bridge, go in the direction opposite of the bridge. To the right of the turret\
      \ you'll see a jumppad leading up. Take that one and take the road on the left\
      \ to the switch. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Defenses here are heavy and include another\
      \ turret which can look over the road to the switch, making a lone player an\
      \ easy target. The defending team has a big loadout of weapons as usual, including\
      \ the Sniper Rifle. Their primary focus should be to guard the road leading\
      \ to the front gate. A useful <a href=\"/Mine_Layer\" title=\"Mine Layer\">Mine\
      \ Layer</a> can be found near the checkpoint as well.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Secure\
      \ the Checkpoint</dt>\n<dd> After you've crossed the bridge in the Hellbender\
      \ you'll get to a crossing. Go right to go to the next checkpoint. The left\
      \ road leads to the magnet, which will be discussed later on. After the turn\
      \ you'll find a more sheltered road on the right. Although it does provide coverage,\
      \ a number of explosive barrels on the end of it will slightly compensate that\
      \ advantage. Right after that tunnel the player can once again choose 2 paths:\
      \ The path on the left is longer, but also much safer. It's also where the <a\
      \ href=\"/Redeemer\" title=\"Redeemer\">Redeemer</a> is located. The path on\
      \ the right is shorter, but not nearly as safe. After the 2 roads join again\
      \ it's a straight piece to the checkpoint. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> For the first\
      \ time the defending team does not have a turret in the area. It may look like\
      \ this area is hard to defend, but it's not. Shooting the  barrels next to the\
      \ group of pipes will cause the pipes to roll free and block most of that route.\
      \ The \"tunnel\" will be the HellBender's only option, making it easy to attack.\
      \ The route through the drive-in cinema is the defending team's only concern.\
      \ The other passage has a button which  activates a set of crushers, causing\
      \ everything inside the passage to be wrecked/killed.    </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Proceed\
      \ to the Main Gates</dt>\n<dd> All there is left now is a last run to the Main\
      \ Gate. Along the way you'll find enemy turrets and exploding barrels. Neither\
      \ should be a problem if you drive fast and keep your eye on the road. Near\
      \ the end the road splits one more time. The left road is slightly quicker due\
      \ to the less steep terrain. The difference is small though. After that you\
      \ should see a flashing tunnel which means you've made it!</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\
      \ Along the road the defending team has 2 more turrets. The first one isn't\
      \ really interesting unless you plan on attacking the Hellbender early on. The\
      \ 2nd turret (which near the end) is more interesting for the defenders, as\
      \ the Mine Layer is in the weapon loadout there. A hill with the turret on there\
      \ splits the road in 2. Shooting the explosive barrels near the big antenna\
      \ will cause it to fall over, blocking 1 of the 2 paths, making it lots easier\
      \ to defend the area. The jumppads make it easy to go from 1 turret to the other\
      \ (even faster than the Hellbender will) so players can attack the vehicle on\
      \ both defense points. </dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons_.26_Pickups\"\

      <dl><dt>Offensive</dt>\n<dd> As mentioned before: the left road right after\
      \ the bridge leads to a magnet. This magnet picks up the Hellbender and carries\
      \ it across the level, out in the open. When the Hellbender is dropped the 5th\
      \ and 6th Objectives will be completed and you can continue to go on to the\
      \ Main Gates. When used successfully, the magnet will give the player a quicker\
      \ route to the end. However, the Hellbender will be very vulnerable to attack,\
      \ as it can be seen and fired at from most of the level. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\
      \ Another thing that might help the attackers is to spread out, especially when\
      \ working in larger teams. 1 person can just go ahead to the switch for the\
      \ next objective, before the defending team builds up its defense, and wait\
      \ for the rest of the team to complete the objective before that.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Defensive</dt>\n<dd> The defending team can make use of all kinds of\
      \ features in this map. Blow up the barrels near the pipes and the big antenna\
      \ at the end to block some passages and make the job easier. Lay down mine fields\
      \ and have the Redeemer ready for when it's needed. The best spot to choke the\
      \ Hellbender is the tunnel near the pipes, as it has to drive through this narrow,\
      \ long cylinder, making it vulnerable to mine fields and other firepower. When\
      \ the attackers use the magnet, then the Redeemer is the best option. Other\
      \ options are turrets (there are 2 with a constant clear view on the magnet)\
      \ and the AVRiL. </dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Single-Player_tips\"\

    text: "{{Infobox Map\n| title       = Junkyard Escape\n| description = This scenario\
      \ is based on an infamous episode of a popular Holovision program. In the original\
      \ episode, two teams of mechanics were competing to make their vehicle operational\
      \ and escape the junk yard. The unexpected twist occurred when the losing team\
      \ pulled out some makeshift weapons and pounded the other team into oblivion\
      \ before they could make their escape. Since there was no explicit rule forbidding\
      \ violence in the competition, they were declared the winners, and a new Tournament\
      \ classic was born.\n| mapimage    = AS-Junkyard.gif\n| imagedesc   = Junkyard\
      \ Escape\n| author      = [[Phil Cole]]\n| players     = 8-16\n| music     \
      \  = KR-Junkyard\n| game        = UT2004\n| gametype    = Assault\n}}\n\n==Map\
      \ Description==\nIn this map the attacking team must \"build\" a [[Hellbender]]\
      \ and race it to the exit of the junkyard. \nThere are a few obstacles along\
      \ the way, with spawnpoints of the defending team nearby. It is their job to\
      \ delay the attackers as much as they can (by destroying the Hellbender or preventing\
      \ the other team from clearing the road to the exit). After one of the obstacles\
      \ has been cleared, a checkpoint becomes available for the attacking team. The\
      \ team with the fastest time wins.\n\nThis map can be considered an updated\
      \ and reimagined [[AS-Rook]].\n\n==Objectives==\n\n;Find the Energy Core\n:\
      \ Before the attackers can use the Hellbender, they first must make it operational.\
      \ For that, they need the core. There is a large clearing outside the attacker's\
      \ base, with a large metal structure in the middle. The core is located on a\
      \ platform inside that structure. \n\n: The spawnpoints of the defending team\
      \ are very close, so they'll be waiting for the attackers near the core. The\
      \ defending team also has a turret on a high ledge to the right which overlooks\
      \ the entire battlefield. This turret can be reached quickly with the network\
      \ of jumppads. \n\n;Return the Core to the Vehicle\n: Pick up the core (by walking\
      \ over it) and take it back to the base. When the person carrying the core dies,\
      \ the core will be dropped and someone else from the attacking team can pick\
      \ it up again. When the core is carried into the base the Hellbender is operational.\n\
      \n: The defenders will have a [[Sniper Rifle]], which can be very effective\
      \ in this battle. If the turret hasn't been taken out yet, then that too still\
      \ forms a threat to the attackers.\n\n;Lower the Bridge\n: Right above the attacker's\
      \ base is a bridge. The problem, however, is that the bridge is open, blocking\
      \ the Hellbender. It's only a small distance from the base though, and a player\
      \ on foot will be there in no-time. When walking out of the base, go left (uphill),\
      \ through the bars and you'll find the switch to lower the bridge on the other\
      \ side of the road. \n\n: The defending team has another turret on the sight,\
      \ which can be really useful for taking down the enemy before they can reach\
      \ the switch. Its view on the switch itself is slightly obstructed by a fence\
      \ and the structure of the bridge. A crouched player near the switch can not\
      \ be shot by the turret. 2 additional healthpack next to the turret should help\
      \ the defenders survive a little longer.\n\n;Cross the Bridge\n: Once the bridge\
      \ is lowered you will have to get the Hellbender across. There are 2 splits\
      \ in the road from the base to the bridge. The left road is the shortest (both\
      \ times). It's also the least safe one, as another turret overlooks that road.\
      \ You'll also have to jump over a fire pit after the 2nd split which may cause\
      \ up to 200 damage to the Hellbender. Make it to the end of the bridge (and\
      \ onto the white platform) for the checkpoint. Your Hellbender will now respawn\
      \ here instead of back at the base.\n\n: The defenders have 3 turrets to use:\
      \ the one that was mentioned just now, the one from the previous objective,\
      \ and the one from the first 2 objectives. The Hellbender can be followed on\
      \ foot by using the jumppads, so an offense of players on foot can be effective\
      \ as well. \n\n;Open the Checkpoint Gate\n: Just like the 3rd Objective: this\
      \ is one for the players on foot. After having opened the bridge, go in the\
      \ direction opposite of the bridge. To the right of the turret you'll see a\
      \ jumppad leading up. Take that one and take the road on the left to the switch.\
      \ \n\n: Defenses here are heavy and include another turret which can look over\
      \ the road to the switch, making a lone player an easy target. The defending\
      \ team has a big loadout of weapons as usual, including the Sniper Rifle. Their\
      \ primary focus should be to guard the road leading to the front gate. A useful\
      \ [[Mine Layer]] can be found near the checkpoint as well.\n\n;Secure the Checkpoint\n\
      : After you've crossed the bridge in the Hellbender you'll get to a crossing.\
      \ Go right to go to the next checkpoint. The left road leads to the magnet,\
      \ which will be discussed later on. After the turn you'll find a more sheltered\
      \ road on the right. Although it does provide coverage, a number of explosive\
      \ barrels on the end of it will slightly compensate that advantage. Right after\
      \ that tunnel the player can once again choose 2 paths: The path on the left\
      \ is longer, but also much safer. It's also where the [[Redeemer]] is located.\
      \ The path on the right is shorter, but not nearly as safe. After the 2 roads\
      \ join again it's a straight piece to the checkpoint. \n\n: For the first time\
      \ the defending team does not have a turret in the area. It may look like this\
      \ area is hard to defend, but it's not. Shooting the  barrels next to the group\
      \ of pipes will cause the pipes to roll free and block most of that route. The\
      \ \"tunnel\" will be the HellBender's only option, making it easy to attack.\
      \ The route through the drive-in cinema is the defending team's only concern.\
      \ The other passage has a button which  activates a set of crushers, causing\
      \ everything inside the passage to be wrecked/killed.    \n\n;Proceed to the\
      \ Main Gates\n: All there is left now is a last run to the Main Gate. Along\
      \ the way you'll find enemy turrets and exploding barrels. Neither should be\
      \ a problem if you drive fast and keep your eye on the road. Near the end the\
      \ road splits one more time. The left road is slightly quicker due to the less\
      \ steep terrain. The difference is small though. After that you should see a\
      \ flashing tunnel which means you've made it!\n\n: Along the road the defending\
      \ team has 2 more turrets. The first one isn't really interesting unless you\
      \ plan on attacking the Hellbender early on. The 2nd turret (which near the\
      \ end) is more interesting for the defenders, as the Mine Layer is in the weapon\
      \ loadout there. A hill with the turret on there splits the road in 2. Shooting\
      \ the explosive barrels near the big antenna will cause it to fall over, blocking\
      \ 1 of the 2 paths, making it lots easier to defend the area. The jumppads make\
      \ it easy to go from 1 turret to the other (even faster than the Hellbender\
      \ will) so players can attack the vehicle on both defense points. \n\n== Weapons\
      \ & Pickups ==\n{{sectstub}}\n===Weapons===\n===Pickups===\n*1x Redeemer (near\
      \ the house in the drive-in cinema)\n*1x AVRiL (on a piece of scrap near the\
      \ magnet)\n===Vehicles and turrets===\n* 1x [[Hellbender]]\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n\
      ;Offensive\n: As mentioned before: the left road right after the bridge leads\
      \ to a magnet. This magnet picks up the Hellbender and carries it across the\
      \ level, out in the open. When the Hellbender is dropped the 5th and 6th Objectives\
      \ will be completed and you can continue to go on to the Main Gates. When used\
      \ successfully, the magnet will give the player a quicker route to the end.\
      \ However, the Hellbender will be very vulnerable to attack, as it can be seen\
      \ and fired at from most of the level. \n\n: Another thing that might help the\
      \ attackers is to spread out, especially when working in larger teams. 1 person\
      \ can just go ahead to the switch for the next objective, before the defending\
      \ team builds up its defense, and wait for the rest of the team to complete\
      \ the objective before that.\n\n;Defensive\n: The defending team can make use\
      \ of all kinds of features in this map. Blow up the barrels near the pipes and\
      \ the big antenna at the end to block some passages and make the job easier.\
      \ Lay down mine fields and have the Redeemer ready for when it's needed. The\
      \ best spot to choke the Hellbender is the tunnel near the pipes, as it has\
      \ to drive through this narrow, long cylinder, making it vulnerable to mine\
      \ fields and other firepower. When the attackers use the magnet, then the Redeemer\
      \ is the best option. Other options are turrets (there are 2 with a constant\
      \ clear view on the magnet) and the AVRiL. \n\n===Single-Player tips===\n{{sectstub}}\n\
      {{Prevnext|AS-Glacier|AS-Mothership|UT2004 AS Ladder}}\n\n==Trivia==\n* The\
      \ map is likely a reference to the [[wikipedia:Scrapheap Challenge|Scrapheap\
      \ Challenge]] TV show, known as Junkyard Wars in the US, where contestants need\
      \ to build a working machine using junkyard items.\n* Many believe the map references\
      \ the [[wikipedia:Goatse.cx|Goatse.cx]] [[wikipedia:Shock site|shock site]]\
      \ with the tunnel at the end of the map (with the pipes at the sides resembling\
      \ the hands).\n* There is a hidden bathtub near where the road from the magnet\
      \ to the main gate and the road from the final checkpoint to the main gate join.\
      \ This bathtub, with a fountain of brown goo coming from the drain could be\
      \ a reference to Tubgirl, another famous shock site.\n* Bot support for this\
      \ map is notoriously buggy.  When defending if you kill a bot holding the power\
      \ core no other bot will pick it up, even after it returns to the respawn point.\
      \ Also, the bots will never take the magnet route, which means that they'll\
      \ always use the same route over and over again.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[DM-Junkyard]]\n\
