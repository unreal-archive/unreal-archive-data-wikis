      \ useful until that point. From then, the primary fire energy bolts are surprisingly\
      \ powerful, but very slow moving making it hard to hit most enemies. If you\
      \ do use them, fire at a fairly close range or against slow targets. Theoretically,\
      \ you could use the wall-bouncing ability to target enemies, but even then the\
      \ shots tend to ricochet into some strange places since they’ll bounce off several\
      \ surfaces before they dissipate. Note that if you fire the dual bolts straigth,\
      \ they will simply stop moving after hitting a wall and will do a mini-explosion\
      \ after that. To make it bounce off walls, the bolts must hit a surface by 5-70°\
      , as anything near 90° will cause it to stop moving (as oppsed to the <a href=\"\

      Force wall\">force walls</a> (again, in one direct hit) by shooting either the\

      \ Medium Drakks which, sure enough, go down in one direct hit.</li>\n<li>Damage\
