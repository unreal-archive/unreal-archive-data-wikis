      >Nali</a> town on the surface of the floating sky island. At the centre of a\
      \ waterfall and a lake, a gigantic obelisk keeps the sky island afloat. Unfortunately,\
      \ even this magical place has been overrun by the <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"\

      \ mountain.</dd>\n<dt> Note</dt>\n<dd> The title of this map, and the map that\
      \ precedes it, suggests that the name \"<a href=\"/Na_Pali\" title=\"Na Pali\"\
      >Na Pali</a>\" was originally only intended to be attributed to this sky island.\
      \ However, \"Na Pali\" has since entered canon as the name of the planet itself,\

      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>The Na Pali Haven... a once peaceful Nali town which stands at the foot\
      \ of a mountain atop the skyborne Na Pali rock. The beautiful haven seems quiet\
      \ at first, but its peace is an illusion that does not last that long... for\
      \ within the mountain, something alien lurks.\n</p><p>You start in the corridor\
      \ you entered at the end of the last level. Follow it round to the right and\
      \ climb steps until you arrive at and pass through a sliding door that leads\
      \ out on to the surface of the rock.\n</p><p>You are in a small earth hollow\
      \ now, so follow the earth slope up to the main ground level which is covered\
      \ in grass. You will round the corner of a building, and be spotted by a <a\
      \ href=\"/Krall\" title=\"Krall\">KrallElite</a> - basically a blue-tattooed\
      \ Krall with greater intelligence and health - who may go for a Nali standing\
      \ in the area. Use the <a href=\"/Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rifle\"\
      >Rifle</a> in zoom mode to decapitate it before it can harm the Nali.\n</p><p>If\
      \ you made proper use of the rifle's zoom mode, you will still be in the vicinity\
      \ of the earth slope you just came up. Opposite the earth slope, a small arched\
      \ doorway goes through a stone wall. Shoot open barrels from behind a lantern\
      \ post here to get two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, then go through the doorway\
      \ itself. Following the ground beyond, you will come to a piece of land where\
      \ a huge white obelisk stands at the centre of a lake with a waterfall cascading\
      \ down off the mountain on the left. You can take a dip if you want, but all\
      \ you'll find is a locked underwater tunnel into the mountain.\n</p><p>Various\
      \ buildings and doors cluster round the banks of this lake, but the only point\
      \ in the lake where you can climb out leads you back on to the land where you\
      \ are currently standing. Nothing to do here then, so go back through the arched\
      \ door to the main area.\n</p><p>Before going any further into the built-up\
      \ area of the town, cross back over and walk along the raised strip of grass\
      \ between a building wall and the earth hollow by which you emerged from the\
      \ caves. Jumping over a low fence, you will arrive in a garden at the edge of\
      \ the rock (don't fall off!) where one of the flowerbeds contains five <a href=\"\
      /Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a>.\n\
      </p><p>Go along the grass to the left of the building. You will arrive on a\
      \ lawn where two <a href=\"/Nali_Cow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nali Cow\"\
      >Nali Cows</a> are grazing; there are two locked sliding barn doors here, plus\
      \ another locked door on a balcony accessible by a flight of wooden steps. Three\
      \ barrels at the back of the area each contain a <a href=\"/Nali_Fruit_Seed\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nali Fruit Seed\">Nali Fruit Seed</a>, but apart\
      \ from that, this area too is a dead end.\n</p><p>Clearly there is nothing more\
      \ to do in this area for now, so return once again to the built-up area at the\
      \ top of the earth slope. As you travel you will see a church above on a plateau\
      \ to the left, but it is inaccessible. So, enter the area between the buildings\
      \ here.\n</p><p>A door on the left of this area is locked, and as you reach\
      \ the far end of the area the grass turns to tiles as a road heads under a building\
      \ to the left, but the road is blocked by some heavy metal gates that won't\
      \ budge in a hurry.\n</p><p>Go back and investiate the one door that you haven't\
      \ tried yet, the door that is to the left as you stand facing the church on\
      \ the plateau. Finally some progress as the door opens and you can step inside\
      \ to a small room with an earth floor. You can open barrels in this area to\
      \ get three <a href=\"/Bandage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bandage\">Bandages</a>\
      \ should you need them, then take the corridor to the right, which ends in a\
      \ locked door. Return to the small room and take the other corridor; this one\
      \ ends in a switch which unlocks the door you were at just now.\n</p><p>Returning\
      \ to the door and going through, you will come out in a barn with two Nali Cows.\
      \ A Nali stands on a wooden trapdoor in the centre of the room beneath a heavy-looking\
      \ wooden platform suspended from the roof. Not a great deal you can do in here\
      \ for now, so look at the room's two exits... the door at the back right is\
      \ locked, but the sliding barn door at the back left has a turning wheel nearby.\
      \ Operate the wheel, and the door will slide open leading you back on to the\
      \ grazing lawn with the Nali Cows. However, the other sliding barn door in this\
      \ area has also opened, allowing you access to another room.\n</p><p>Enter the\
      \ revealed room, which also has an earth floor. Within, you will find a Nali\
      \ being watched by a pair of Krall guards whilst a KrallElite guards the doorway\
      \ in to the next room. Kill the guards before the Nali can come to any harm.\
      \ Then, raid this room for its gear; two ASMD Cores are at the back of this\
      \ room, while crates in another corner contain three Clips.\n</p><p>Go through\
      \ the doorway the KrallElite was guarding. Kill the two Krall who attack as\
      \ you enter, then collect the Health Pack from the far side of the room. Head\
      \ for the wooden steps at the far end of the room, then go beneath them to collect\
      \ two boxes of 10 Flak Shells.\n</p><p>Cimb the steps and kill the bewildered\
      \ Krall who was asleep at his post. You will be in a balcony room with tables\
      \ where a window has a view out to the surrounding sky. In their respective\
      \ corners of the room are a Health Pack and two boxes of 8 Rifle Rounds.\n</p><p>Go\
      \ to the far corner of this room and behind the partition wall there; you will\
      \ come to a lever which you can press and watch through a window as the doors\
      \ on the balcony above the grazing lawn swing open. So, leave this building\
      \ and go back out through the barn doors to the grazing lawn. Climb the steps\
      \ on the left so that you arrive on the balcony. On the balcony, kill the two\
      \ Krall who come out of the now open room. When they are dead, you may want\
      \ to take the opportunity to pay a visit to the Nali Healing Fruit in the flowerbed\
      \ you passed earlier.\n</p><p>Enter the upstairs room. Here, glass windows overlook\
      \ the built up area you were in earlier (you can smash them if you are feeling\
      \ destructive). Explore the right-hand end of the room; there's a <a href=\"\
      /Dispersion_Pistol_Powerup\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol Powerup\">Dispersion\
      \ Pistol Powerup</a> on the floor, and if you jump on to the table there's a\
      \ Health Pack and a diary [1].\n</p><p>Go to the far end of the room and through\
      \ a doorway there - beware a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScout</a> who comes out from the right as you enter the\
      \ corridor beyond. Kill it, then go into its alcove for a Health Pack, before\
      \ continuing along the corridor and through the next doors on to a balcony above\
      \ the Nali Cow barn.\n</p><p>Follow the balcony a short distance. At the back\
      \ of the room, one of the pillars has a light bracket on it from which no lantern\
      \ is suspended. Jump on to the light bracket and it moves down slightly, causing\
      \ a hidden door off the balcony to open. Return to the balcony and enter the\
      \ secret room. Collect two Health Packs from the floor within and open chests\
      \ for an <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a>\
      \ and a can of 12 Eightballs. There's also a diary on the table [2].\n</p><p>Leave\
      \ the chamber and follow the balcony around to the far side of the barn. Look\
      \ again at the heavy wooden platform suspended above the praying Nali - you\
      \ are going to be dropping that platform, so you need to find a way of displacing\
      \ the Nali so he doesn't get killed. You could be brutal and shoot him (once),\
      \ but I prefer a more subtle approach.\n</p><p>Open the door at the end of the\
      \ balcony. Two Krall on guard inside will come out and attack you. Lead them\
      \ on to the balcony then drop down to the barn floor - the Nali will see the\
      \ Krall jump down and take fright, which will shake him out of his catatonic\
      \ state and make him get out of the way.\n</p><p>When the Krall are dead, return\
      \ to the balcony via the steps outside. Follow the balcony round and go into\
      \ the room the Krall were guarding. There is nothing special about this room;\
      \ crates contain three Clips, and another door leads out on to a smaller, isolated\
      \ balcony above the barn. Go out on to this balcony and collect a <a href=\"\
      /Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a> that is on the left, then\
      \ press the lever on the right.\n</p><p>When you press the lever, the heavy\
      \ wooden platform will be released from its support on the roof. It will fall\
      \ down and smash through the wooden trapdoor in the floor, into the cellar below,\
      \ then break into pieces itself on the cellar floor. Follow it down - via the\
      \ barn floor so that you don't take falling damage - so that you too land in\
      \ the cellar.\n</p><p>The cellar has gear and crates in the corners, and an\
      \ exit to a small foyer. Don't go to the exit yet. Visit the various corners\
      \ to find two Health Packs and containers with three clusters of 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards and a box of 8 Rifle Rounds.\n</p><p>Ready a powerful weapon now and\
      \ approach the exit. As you do so, doors will slam shut locking you in, and\
      \ will not open until a nasty <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a> who drops in through a hole in the ceiling\
      \ is dead. Kill the Skaarj and go out into the foyer. If you double back to\
      \ the right, you will follow a corridor past a Nali before going up a slope\
      \ to a small room where you can open a door back to the barn, but you don't\
      \ need to do this unless you're looking for health and ammo.\n</p><p>Stand in\
      \ the foyer and look at the back wall. There's a fairly obvious crack in the\
      \ wall there - use a reasonably powerful weapon such as your powered up primary\
      \ fire <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion\
      \ Pistol</a>, and shoot the wall by the crack. It will blast open to reveal\
      \ another cellar beyond.\n</p><p>Go up to your home-made hole and take a jump\
      \ into the cellar beyond. Several <a href=\"/Pupae\" title=\"Pupae\">Pupae</a>\
      \ will attack you here so you will have to kill them, but if like mine your\
      \ Dispersion Pistol has reached power 5 by now, then you can silence them each\
      \ in one primary fire shot. Time to raid the cellar now, so go to the back on\
      \ the right for two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge and a Health Pack. Collect\
      \ what you need, then approach the far end of the cellar, where a single Pupae\
      \ attacks from beneath a staircase. Kill it then go under the stairs yourself\
      \ for two boxes of 10 Flak Shells.\n</p><p>Climb the stairs now. As you open\
      \ the doors at the top, watch out for a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjTrooper</a> with a <a href=\"/Bio_Rifle\" title=\"\
      Bio Rifle\">GES Biorifle</a> who will attack from the next room. Kill the Skaarj,\
      \ then collect the GES Biorifle and <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"Shock Rifle\"\
      >ASMD</a> that he drops. Raid this ground floor room - there are two Health\
      \ Packs behind a table to the left, and two ASMD Cores at the back of the room\
      \ ahead. The door to the left is a route out to the main built-up area, but\
      \ you don't want to take it yet. Go instead towards the staircase to the right,\
      \ taking a brief diversion under the staircase for two Clips.\n</p><p>Climb\
      \ the steps here and go along the top room, which opens out into a library to\
      \ the right guarded by a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol. If you go into\
      \ the library, you can collect two Health Packs from between the bookcases and\
      \ read a diary on the table [3].\n</p><p>Opposite the library, there's another\
      \ door you haven't ued yet. Go through and you will find a small room guarded\
      \ by a SkaarjWarrior. There are two cans of 12 Eightballs and a lever within;\
      \ if you activate the lever, you can watch through a grid in the floor as the\
      \ hefty metal gates outside that were blocked earlier swing open.\n</p><p>Go\
      \ back down the steps and out through the door on the ground floor of this building.\
      \ You will be back near the start, having come out of the previously locked\
      \ doors. Turn left and go along outside, and you will arrive at the open gates.\
      \ Pass through the gates and go along to the right on the tiled road beyond.\
      \ Shortly, you will pass a Nali and arrive at a plaza with a pool and statue\
      \ in the middle.\n</p><p>This attractive plaza is guarded by two Krall who see\
      \ you from a distance. Decapitate them with the Rifle, then take a look around.\
      \ To the left, the road continues through below a building. First things first,\
      \ visit a small grassy hollow on the right accessible by a few steps that contains\
      \ barrels that reveal three Clips. A similar hollow to the left of the road\
      \ has a small arched door out to the bank of the lake, but it doesn't get you\
      \ anywhere useful.\n</p><p>So, follow the road off through the arch. You will\
      \ come out on another stretch of tiled road; if you go to the dead end on the\
      \ left, you can open three barrels which contain a random assortment of Tarydium\
      \ Shards, Pupae and Health Packs. If you need to go back for any health or ammo,\
      \ do so now. When you're ready to move on, head off up the road.\n</p><p>As\
      \ you turn the first corner to the left you will come up against the combined\
      \ strength of a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol and a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjInfantry</a> with a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"\
      Stinger\">Stinger</a>. Kill them then collect the two Stingers the SkaarjInfantry\
      \ drops. Go along to the second corner of the road then collect the Health Pack\
      \ on offer there.\n</p><p>Continuing down the third straight of the road, you\
      \ will pass a door to a building on the left, but it is locked. Continue along\
      \ the road, collecting on the way the Clip hidden behind the chimney breast\
      \ of the building on the left. After the third corner, you will descend some\
      \ steps and reach a small arched door on the left, which you can pass through\
      \ on to a grassy lawn on the edge of the Na Pali rock.\n</p><p>This grassy area\
      \ has a Nali and a Nali Cow standing by a hay cart to the left. A sliding door\
      \ into the building on the left is locked; further along on the left another\
      \ small arched door leads on to the third bank of the lake. Here on the lake\
      \ side of the nearest building, there is another locked door; remember its position.\
      \ Return to the grassy lawn.\n</p><p>Go across the grassy area to the point\
      \ where the grass stretches off into a ledge around the mountain on the edge\
      \ of the rock.\n</p><p>Going on round the edge of the mountain, you will pass\
      \ beneath a Skaarj dock carved out of the mountain side with a forcefield over\
      \ it. It's of no relevance to you for now, so go on past. Soon you will see\
      \ a Krall and KrallElite looking out over the edge of the rock; I use the Rifle's\
      \ zoom mode to decapitate the pair of them. Go to the far end of this ledge\
      \ to collect the <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault\
      \ Vest\">Assault Vest</a> there, then turn around and head back to the main\
      \ grassy area. Go straight across the area and back out through the small door\
      \ to the road - the other features of this area are for later.\n</p><p>Follow\
      \ the road to the left and on round until shortly it comes to an end on a balcony\
      \ round a water pool in a lower area below accessible by steps. A pair of KrallElite\
      \ are on guard here. Once again, the rifle comes out...\n</p><p>Go to the far\
      \ corner of this area and descend the steps to the poolside. Open barrels here\
      \ for two <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flares</a>, then look down into\
      \ the water and kill the <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a>\
      \ lurking within. There are two entrances to water tunnels here; take the one\
      \ nearest the bottom of the staircase, but beware the two <a href=\"/Tentacle\"\
      \ title=\"Tentacle\">Tentacles</a> who will attack from either side within.\n\
      </p><p>I like to take the long way round. So, go along the ledge alongside the\
      \ water in the tunnel in a clockwise direction. In the next straight after the\
      \ first corner, kill the Tentacle and Devilfish lurking. Round the second corner,\
      \ you will pass the other entrance to the water tunnels and will have to kill\
      \ another Tentacle. When you have gone three quarters of the way round the tunnels\
      \ clockwise, you will see light hitting the wall that is streaming through a\
      \ crack from a cellar beyond. Shoot the crack open like you did before.\n</p><p>The\
      \ cellar beyond is a large wine cellar. Dispose of the giant wine barrel that\
      \ blocks the way then turn left as you emerge in the main cellar. Going along\
      \ are two more alcoves with giant wine barrels, one of which contains a Pupae.\
      \ Go to the far end, where you can collect two Health Packs, then double back\
      \ between the racks in the centre of the room and you will come up behind a\
      \ SkaarjWarrior on guard.\n</p><p>Kill the Skaarj then open crates beyond to\
      \ find two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Go round to the left, past another giant\
      \ barrel containing a Pupae, until you reach a door out of the main cellar room.\
      \ Beyond the door, the corridor winds up and round to a Krall whom you should\
      \ kill. At the very top of the ramps you will meet another Krall before ultimately\
      \ coming out in a small storage room.\nVases on the shelves in the storage room\
      \ here reveal nothing, so open and pass through the doors on the right into\
      \ an inn where a group of Krall are playing dice while a Nali stands behind\
      \ the bar.\n</p><p>Load up a few Eightballs and blast the Krall out of existence.\
      \ Go behind the bar and press the pale block underneath; this will later allow\
      \ you access to the balconies above the inn floor. If you're short of health,\
      \ jump up on to the bar and collect the Health Pack there. When you're done,\
      \ go and investigate the fireplace.\n</p><p>A hidden switch at the back right\
      \ of the fireplace opens a hidden door near the bar, but watch out for the two\
      \ Pupae who jump down the chimney from above. Enter the revealed room behind\
      \ the hidden door and go along to the far end where chests reveal two boxes\
      \ of 10 Flak Shells. There's also a diary on a small table here [4].\n</p><p>Leave\
      \ the hidden room and go out through the other door from the main inn room into\
      \ the inn porch. To the left is the front door (it was locked when you passed\
      \ it earlier but is unlocked now) out to the tiled road. To the right is a flight\
      \ of steps to a door that, provided you pressed the block under the bar, opens\
      \ to reveal a small room beyond which is guarded by a SkaarjWarrior. When the\
      \ Skaarj is dead, go through the next door, and you will come out on the balconies\
      \ above the inn floor. Follow the curve of the balcony until it forks into doors\
      \ to the left and right.\n</p><p>Take the left fork and enter the right of the\
      \ two doors at that end of the balcony. This bedroom is occupied by a sleeping\
      \ SkaarjWarrior, and a chest nearby contains at random either a Flare or a Pupae.\
      \ The other door at this end of the balcony leads to a short corridor with two\
      \ bedrooms off it; the one on the right contains just a chest with a Pupae /\
      \ Flare at random, whilst the one on the left has a sleeping SkaarjWarrior but\
      \ also a chst containing <a href=\"/SCUBA_Gear\" title=\"SCUBA Gear\">SCUBA\
      \ Gear</a>.\n</p><p>Retun to the balcony and follow it round to the remaining\
      \ door. There is a chamber with a lever. Press it to receive a message [5].\n\
      </p><p>The door you have opened is that door you saw on the lakeside on the\
      \ third bank of the lake. The quickest way to get to that door is to blast the\
      \ window open and jump through; you will land on the third bank of the lake,\
      \ where the doors you have now opened reveal a small room with a Health Pack,\
      \ a box of 10 Flak Shells and a lever.\n</p><p>Press the lever and return to\
      \ the lake bank. Go to the right and through the small arched door, arriving\
      \ back in the grassy lawn on the edge of the rock where the sliding door in\
      \ the adjacent building is now open. As you go in the direction of the open\
      \ door, a SkaarjWarrior will come out from inside. When he is dead you may be\
      \ inclined to go inside through the open door, but first take the following\
      \ diversion for some useful gear.\n</p><p>Look over towards the arched door\
      \ to the tiled road. You will see to the left of that the grass plateau continuing\
      \ round the end of the town walls. Follow it round, and it opens out to a grassy\
      \ area where there are two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Continue round the ledge\
      \ and you will go down a long straight where two Nali Healing Fruit can be collected,\
      \ before arriving in another area where there are two cans of 12 Eightballs.\n\
      </p><p>One last stretch and one last corner, then you will arrive at the end\
      \ of the ledge, where there is a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a>. Collect the pack then start\
      \ to retrace your steps along the ledge. As you return, expect to meet three\
      \ Krall in the Eightballs area and two Krall beyond the Flak Shells area. Decapitate\
      \ them with your Rifle then return to the main grassy lawn.\n</p><p>Enter the\
      \ open door and go into the small room beyond, where barrels can be opened to\
      \ retrieve a Health Pack and two boxes of 8 Rifle Rounds. Continue through the\
      \ next door and you will arrive in a room modified by the Skaarj to incorporate\
      \ a lift and two large information panels. Read the panels [6, 7].\n</p><p>There's\
      \ a Health Pack at the back of the room. Collect it if necessary then activate\
      \ the small green panel by the entrance. The lift descends to this floor; step\
      \ aboard. You will rise to a Skaarj-outfitted room above. Behind you are two\
      \ cans of 12 Eightballs. To the right of a cluster of metal crates are two packs\
      \ of Razor Blades, and a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol beyond drops\
      \ a <a href=\"/Ripper\" title=\"Ripper\">Razorjack</a> when he is killed.\n\
      </p><p>Go to the far end of the room and collect of the two Health Packs should\
      \ you need two. Go through the door on the left and you will be in a room with\
      \ a control panel and a window overlooking the waterfall.\n</p><p>Activate the\
      \ panel and a display appears, with a picture of the obelisk and pool at its\
      \ centre. A message bleeps your Universal Translator [8].\n</p><p>You have opened\
      \ the metal barriers underwater blocking the tunnel beneath the waterfall into\
      \ the mountain. So, collect the Health Pack here then go back out to the lift.\
      \ Go down it (activate it by pressing the green panel behind the support pillar)\
      \ to the ground floor. Leave the building and go round to the left, through\
      \ the arched door and back on to the lakeside. Jump into the water and swim\
      \ to beneath the waterfall. Enter the now open underwater tunnel beneath the\
      \ waterfall to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      The Na Pali Haven... a once peaceful Nali town which stands at the foot of a\
      \ mountain atop the skyborne Na Pali rock. The beautiful haven seems quiet at\
      \ first, but its peace is an illusion that does not last that long... for within\
      \ the mountain, something alien lurks.\n\nYou start in the corridor you entered\
      \ at the end of the last level. Follow it round to the right and climb steps\
      \ until you arrive at and pass through a sliding door that leads out on to the\
      \ surface of the rock.\n\nYou are in a small earth hollow now, so follow the\
      \ earth slope up to the main ground level which is covered in grass. You will\
      \ round the corner of a building, and be spotted by a [[Krall|KrallElite]] -\
      \ basically a blue-tattooed Krall with greater intelligence and health - who\
      \ may go for a Nali standing in the area. Use the [[Rifle]] in zoom mode to\
      \ decapitate it before it can harm the Nali.\n\nIf you made proper use of the\
      \ rifle's zoom mode, you will still be in the vicinity of the earth slope you\
      \ just came up. Opposite the earth slope, a small arched doorway goes through\
      \ a stone wall. Shoot open barrels from behind a lantern post here to get two\
      \ clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, then go through the doorway itself. Following\
      \ the ground beyond, you will come to a piece of land where a huge white obelisk\
      \ stands at the centre of a lake with a waterfall cascading down off the mountain\
      \ on the left. You can take a dip if you want, but all you'll find is a locked\
      \ underwater tunnel into the mountain.\n\nVarious buildings and doors cluster\
      \ round the banks of this lake, but the only point in the lake where you can\
      \ climb out leads you back on to the land where you are currently standing.\
      \ Nothing to do here then, so go back through the arched door to the main area.\n\
      \nBefore going any further into the built-up area of the town, cross back over\
      \ and walk along the raised strip of grass between a building wall and the earth\
      \ hollow by which you emerged from the caves. Jumping over a low fence, you\
      \ will arrive in a garden at the edge of the rock (don't fall off!) where one\
      \ of the flowerbeds contains five [[Nali Healing Fruit]].\n\nGo along the grass\
      \ to the left of the building. You will arrive on a lawn where two [[Nali Cow]]s\
      \ are grazing; there are two locked sliding barn doors here, plus another locked\
      \ door on a balcony accessible by a flight of wooden steps. Three barrels at\
      \ the back of the area each contain a [[Nali Fruit Seed]], but apart from that,\
      \ this area too is a dead end.\n\nClearly there is nothing more to do in this\
      \ area for now, so return once again to the built-up area at the top of the\
      \ earth slope. As you travel you will see a church above on a plateau to the\
      \ left, but it is inaccessible. So, enter the area between the buildings here.\n\
      \nA door on the left of this area is locked, and as you reach the far end of\
      \ the area the grass turns to tiles as a road heads under a building to the\
      \ left, but the road is blocked by some heavy metal gates that won't budge in\
      \ a hurry.\n\nGo back and investiate the one door that you haven't tried yet,\
      \ the door that is to the left as you stand facing the church on the plateau.\
      \ Finally some progress as the door opens and you can step inside to a small\
      \ room with an earth floor. You can open barrels in this area to get three [[Bandage|Bandages]]\
      \ should you need them, then take the corridor to the right, which ends in a\
      \ locked door. Return to the small room and take the other corridor; this one\
      \ ends in a switch which unlocks the door you were at just now.\n\nReturning\
      \ to the door and going through, you will come out in a barn with two Nali Cows.\
      \ A Nali stands on a wooden trapdoor in the centre of the room beneath a heavy-looking\
      \ wooden platform suspended from the roof. Not a great deal you can do in here\
      \ for now, so look at the room's two exits... the door at the back right is\
      \ locked, but the sliding barn door at the back left has a turning wheel nearby.\
      \ Operate the wheel, and the door will slide open leading you back on to the\
      \ grazing lawn with the Nali Cows. However, the other sliding barn door in this\
      \ area has also opened, allowing you access to another room.\n\nEnter the revealed\
      \ room, which also has an earth floor. Within, you will find a Nali being watched\
      \ by a pair of Krall guards whilst a KrallElite guards the doorway in to the\
      \ next room. Kill the guards before the Nali can come to any harm. Then, raid\
      \ this room for its gear; two ASMD Cores are at the back of this room, while\
      \ crates in another corner contain three Clips.\n\nGo through the doorway the\
      \ KrallElite was guarding. Kill the two Krall who attack as you enter, then\
      \ collect the Health Pack from the far side of the room. Head for the wooden\
      \ steps at the far end of the room, then go beneath them to collect two boxes\
      \ of 10 Flak Shells.\n\nCimb the steps and kill the bewildered Krall who was\
      \ asleep at his post. You will be in a balcony room with tables where a window\
      \ has a view out to the surrounding sky. In their respective corners of the\
      \ room are a Health Pack and two boxes of 8 Rifle Rounds.\n\nGo to the far corner\
      \ of this room and behind the partition wall there; you will come to a lever\
      \ which you can press and watch through a window as the doors on the balcony\
      \ above the grazing lawn swing open. So, leave this building and go back out\
      \ through the barn doors to the grazing lawn. Climb the steps on the left so\
      \ that you arrive on the balcony. On the balcony, kill the two Krall who come\
      \ out of the now open room. When they are dead, you may want to take the opportunity\
      \ to pay a visit to the Nali Healing Fruit in the flowerbed you passed earlier.\n\
      \nEnter the upstairs room. Here, glass windows overlook the built up area you\
      \ were in earlier (you can smash them if you are feeling destructive). Explore\
      \ the right-hand end of the room; there's a [[Dispersion Pistol Powerup]] on\
      \ the floor, and if you jump on to the table there's a Health Pack and a diary\
      \ [1].\n\nGo to the far end of the room and through a doorway there - beware\
      \ a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScout]] who comes out from the right\
      \ as you enter the corridor beyond. Kill it, then go into its alcove for a Health\
      \ Pack, before continuing along the corridor and through the next doors on to\
      \ a balcony above the Nali Cow barn.\n\nFollow the balcony a short distance.\
      \ At the back of the room, one of the pillars has a light bracket on it from\
      \ which no lantern is suspended. Jump on to the light bracket and it moves down\
      \ slightly, causing a hidden door off the balcony to open. Return to the balcony\
      \ and enter the secret room. Collect two Health Packs from the floor within\
      \ and open chests for an [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Gun]] and a can of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ There's also a diary on the table [2].\n\nLeave the chamber and follow the\
      \ balcony around to the far side of the barn. Look again at the heavy wooden\
      \ platform suspended above the praying Nali - you are going to be dropping that\
      \ platform, so you need to find a way of displacing the Nali so he doesn't get\
      \ killed. You could be brutal and shoot him (once), but I prefer a more subtle\
      \ approach.\n\nOpen the door at the end of the balcony. Two Krall on guard inside\
      \ will come out and attack you. Lead them on to the balcony then drop down to\
      \ the barn floor - the Nali will see the Krall jump down and take fright, which\
      \ will shake him out of his catatonic state and make him get out of the way.\n\
      \nWhen the Krall are dead, return to the balcony via the steps outside. Follow\
      \ the balcony round and go into the room the Krall were guarding. There is nothing\
      \ special about this room; crates contain three Clips, and another door leads\
      \ out on to a smaller, isolated balcony above the barn. Go out on to this balcony\
      \ and collect a [[Flashlight]] that is on the left, then press the lever on\
      \ the right.\n\nWhen you press the lever, the heavy wooden platform will be\
      \ released from its support on the roof. It will fall down and smash through\
      \ the wooden trapdoor in the floor, into the cellar below, then break into pieces\
      \ itself on the cellar floor. Follow it down - via the barn floor so that you\
      \ don't take falling damage - so that you too land in the cellar.\n\nThe cellar\
      \ has gear and crates in the corners, and an exit to a small foyer. Don't go\
      \ to the exit yet. Visit the various corners to find two Health Packs and containers\
      \ with three clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 8 Rifle Rounds.\n\n\
      Ready a powerful weapon now and approach the exit. As you do so, doors will\
      \ slam shut locking you in, and will not open until a nasty [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]]\
      \ who drops in through a hole in the ceiling is dead. Kill the Skaarj and go\
      \ out into the foyer. If you double back to the right, you will follow a corridor\
      \ past a Nali before going up a slope to a small room where you can open a door\
      \ back to the barn, but you don't need to do this unless you're looking for\
      \ health and ammo.\n\nStand in the foyer and look at the back wall. There's\
      \ a fairly obvious crack in the wall there - use a reasonably powerful weapon\
      \ such as your powered up primary fire [[Dispersion Pistol]], and shoot the\
      \ wall by the crack. It will blast open to reveal another cellar beyond.\n\n\
      Go up to your home-made hole and take a jump into the cellar beyond. Several\
      \ [[Pupae]] will attack you here so you will have to kill them, but if like\
      \ mine your Dispersion Pistol has reached power 5 by now, then you can silence\
      \ them each in one primary fire shot. Time to raid the cellar now, so go to\
      \ the back on the right for two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge and a Health Pack.\
      \ Collect what you need, then approach the far end of the cellar, where a single\
      \ Pupae attacks from beneath a staircase. Kill it then go under the stairs yourself\
      \ for two boxes of 10 Flak Shells.\n\nClimb the stairs now. As you open the\
      \ doors at the top, watch out for a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper|SkaarjTrooper]]\
      \ with a [[Bio Rifle|GES Biorifle]] who will attack from the next room. Kill\
      \ the Skaarj, then collect the GES Biorifle and [[Shock Rifle|ASMD]] that he\
      \ drops. Raid this ground floor room - there are two Health Packs behind a table\
      \ to the left, and two ASMD Cores at the back of the room ahead. The door to\
      \ the left is a route out to the main built-up area, but you don't want to take\
      \ it yet. Go instead towards the staircase to the right, taking a brief diversion\
      \ under the staircase for two Clips.\n\nClimb the steps here and go along the\
      \ top room, which opens out into a library to the right guarded by a SkaarjTrooper\
      \ with a Dispersion Pistol. If you go into the library, you can collect two\
      \ Health Packs from between the bookcases and read a diary on the table [3].\n\
      \nOpposite the library, there's another door you haven't ued yet. Go through\
      \ and you will find a small room guarded by a SkaarjWarrior. There are two cans\
      \ of 12 Eightballs and a lever within; if you activate the lever, you can watch\
      \ through a grid in the floor as the hefty metal gates outside that were blocked\
      \ earlier swing open.\n\nGo back down the steps and out through the door on\
      \ the ground floor of this building. You will be back near the start, having\
      \ come out of the previously locked doors. Turn left and go along outside, and\
      \ you will arrive at the open gates. Pass through the gates and go along to\
      \ the right on the tiled road beyond. Shortly, you will pass a Nali and arrive\
      \ at a plaza with a pool and statue in the middle.\n\nThis attractive plaza\
      \ is guarded by two Krall who see you from a distance. Decapitate them with\
      \ the Rifle, then take a look around. To the left, the road continues through\
      \ below a building. First things first, visit a small grassy hollow on the right\
      \ accessible by a few steps that contains barrels that reveal three Clips. A\
      \ similar hollow to the left of the road has a small arched door out to the\
      \ bank of the lake, but it doesn't get you anywhere useful.\n\nSo, follow the\
      \ road off through the arch. You will come out on another stretch of tiled road;\
      \ if you go to the dead end on the left, you can open three barrels which contain\
      \ a random assortment of Tarydium Shards, Pupae and Health Packs. If you need\
      \ to go back for any health or ammo, do so now. When you're ready to move on,\
      \ head off up the road.\n\nAs you turn the first corner to the left you will\
      \ come up against the combined strength of a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion\
      \ Pistol and a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry|SkaarjInfantry]] with a [[Stinger]].\
      \ Kill them then collect the two Stingers the SkaarjInfantry drops. Go along\
      \ to the second corner of the road then collect the Health Pack on offer there.\n\
      \nContinuing down the third straight of the road, you will pass a door to a\
      \ building on the left, but it is locked. Continue along the road, collecting\
      \ on the way the Clip hidden behind the chimney breast of the building on the\
      \ left. After the third corner, you will descend some steps and reach a small\
      \ arched door on the left, which you can pass through on to a grassy lawn on\
      \ the edge of the Na Pali rock.\n\nThis grassy area has a Nali and a Nali Cow\
      \ standing by a hay cart to the left. A sliding door into the building on the\
      \ left is locked; further along on the left another small arched door leads\
      \ on to the third bank of the lake. Here on the lake side of the nearest building,\
      \ there is another locked door; remember its position. Return to the grassy\
      \ lawn.\n\nGo across the grassy area to the point where the grass stretches\
      \ off into a ledge around the mountain on the edge of the rock.\n\nGoing on\
      \ round the edge of the mountain, you will pass beneath a Skaarj dock carved\
      \ out of the mountain side with a forcefield over it. It's of no relevance to\
      \ you for now, so go on past. Soon you will see a Krall and KrallElite looking\
      \ out over the edge of the rock; I use the Rifle's zoom mode to decapitate the\
      \ pair of them. Go to the far end of this ledge to collect the [[Assault Vest]]\
      \ there, then turn around and head back to the main grassy area. Go straight\
      \ across the area and back out through the small door to the road - the other\
      \ features of this area are for later.\n\nFollow the road to the left and on\
      \ round until shortly it comes to an end on a balcony round a water pool in\
      \ a lower area below accessible by steps. A pair of KrallElite are on guard\
      \ here. Once again, the rifle comes out...\n\nGo to the far corner of this area\
      \ and descend the steps to the poolside. Open barrels here for two [[Flare|Flares]],\
      \ then look down into the water and kill the [[Devilfish]] lurking within. There\
      \ are two entrances to water tunnels here; take the one nearest the bottom of\
      \ the staircase, but beware the two [[Tentacle|Tentacles]] who will attack from\
      \ either side within.\n\nI like to take the long way round. So, go along the\
      \ ledge alongside the water in the tunnel in a clockwise direction. In the next\
      \ straight after the first corner, kill the Tentacle and Devilfish lurking.\
      \ Round the second corner, you will pass the other entrance to the water tunnels\
      \ and will have to kill another Tentacle. When you have gone three quarters\
      \ of the way round the tunnels clockwise, you will see light hitting the wall\
      \ that is streaming through a crack from a cellar beyond. Shoot the crack open\
      \ like you did before.\n\nThe cellar beyond is a large wine cellar. Dispose\
      \ of the giant wine barrel that blocks the way then turn left as you emerge\
      \ in the main cellar. Going along are two more alcoves with giant wine barrels,\
      \ one of which contains a Pupae. Go to the far end, where you can collect two\
      \ Health Packs, then double back between the racks in the centre of the room\
      \ and you will come up behind a SkaarjWarrior on guard.\n\nKill the Skaarj then\
      \ open crates beyond to find two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Go round to the left,\
      \ past another giant barrel containing a Pupae, until you reach a door out of\
      \ the main cellar room. Beyond the door, the corridor winds up and round to\
      \ a Krall whom you should kill. At the very top of the ramps you will meet another\
      \ Krall before ultimately coming out in a small storage room.\nVases on the\
      \ shelves in the storage room here reveal nothing, so open and pass through\
      \ the doors on the right into an inn where a group of Krall are playing dice\
      \ while a Nali stands behind the bar.\n\nLoad up a few Eightballs and blast\
      \ the Krall out of existence. Go behind the bar and press the pale block underneath;\
      \ this will later allow you access to the balconies above the inn floor. If\
      \ you're short of health, jump up on to the bar and collect the Health Pack\
      \ there. When you're done, go and investigate the fireplace.\n\nA hidden switch\
      \ at the back right of the fireplace opens a hidden door near the bar, but watch\
      \ out for the two Pupae who jump down the chimney from above. Enter the revealed\
      \ room behind the hidden door and go along to the far end where chests reveal\
      \ two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. There's also a diary on a small table here [4].\n\
      \nLeave the hidden room and go out through the other door from the main inn\
      \ room into the inn porch. To the left is the front door (it was locked when\
      \ you passed it earlier but is unlocked now) out to the tiled road. To the right\
      \ is a flight of steps to a door that, provided you pressed the block under\
      \ the bar, opens to reveal a small room beyond which is guarded by a SkaarjWarrior.\
      \ When the Skaarj is dead, go through the next door, and you will come out on\
      \ the balconies above the inn floor. Follow the curve of the balcony until it\
      \ forks into doors to the left and right.\n\nTake the left fork and enter the\
      \ right of the two doors at that end of the balcony. This bedroom is occupied\
      \ by a sleeping SkaarjWarrior, and a chest nearby contains at random either\
      \ a Flare or a Pupae. The other door at this end of the balcony leads to a short\
      \ corridor with two bedrooms off it; the one on the right contains just a chest\
      \ with a Pupae / Flare at random, whilst the one on the left has a sleeping\
      \ SkaarjWarrior but also a chst containing [[SCUBA Gear]].\n\nRetun to the balcony\
      \ and follow it round to the remaining door. There is a chamber with a lever.\
      \ Press it to receive a message [5].\n\nThe door you have opened is that door\
      \ you saw on the lakeside on the third bank of the lake. The quickest way to\
      \ get to that door is to blast the window open and jump through; you will land\
      \ on the third bank of the lake, where the doors you have now opened reveal\
      \ a small room with a Health Pack, a box of 10 Flak Shells and a lever.\n\n\
      Press the lever and return to the lake bank. Go to the right and through the\
      \ small arched door, arriving back in the grassy lawn on the edge of the rock\
      \ where the sliding door in the adjacent building is now open. As you go in\
      \ the direction of the open door, a SkaarjWarrior will come out from inside.\
      \ When he is dead you may be inclined to go inside through the open door, but\
      \ first take the following diversion for some useful gear.\n\nLook over towards\
      \ the arched door to the tiled road. You will see to the left of that the grass\
      \ plateau continuing round the end of the town walls. Follow it round, and it\
      \ opens out to a grassy area where there are two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Continue\
      \ round the ledge and you will go down a long straight where two Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit can be collected, before arriving in another area where there are two\
      \ cans of 12 Eightballs.\n\nOne last stretch and one last corner, then you will\
      \ arrive at the end of the ledge, where there is a [[Super Health Pack]]. Collect\
      \ the pack then start to retrace your steps along the ledge. As you return,\
      \ expect to meet three Krall in the Eightballs area and two Krall beyond the\
      \ Flak Shells area. Decapitate them with your Rifle then return to the main\
      \ grassy lawn.\n\nEnter the open door and go into the small room beyond, where\
      \ barrels can be opened to retrieve a Health Pack and two boxes of 8 Rifle Rounds.\
      \ Continue through the next door and you will arrive in a room modified by the\
      \ Skaarj to incorporate a lift and two large information panels. Read the panels\
      \ [6, 7].\n\nThere's a Health Pack at the back of the room. Collect it if necessary\
      \ then activate the small green panel by the entrance. The lift descends to\
      \ this floor; step aboard. You will rise to a Skaarj-outfitted room above. Behind\
      \ you are two cans of 12 Eightballs. To the right of a cluster of metal crates\
      \ are two packs of Razor Blades, and a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol\
      \ beyond drops a [[Ripper|Razorjack]] when he is killed.\n\nGo to the far end\
      \ of the room and collect of the two Health Packs should you need two. Go through\
      \ the door on the left and you will be in a room with a control panel and a\
      \ window overlooking the waterfall.\n\nActivate the panel and a display appears,\
      \ with a picture of the obelisk and pool at its centre. A message bleeps your\
      \ Universal Translator [8].\n\nYou have opened the metal barriers underwater\
      \ blocking the tunnel beneath the waterfall into the mountain. So, collect the\
      \ Health Pack here then go back out to the lift. Go down it (activate it by\
      \ pressing the green panel behind the support pillar) to the ground floor. Leave\
      \ the building and go round to the left, through the arched door and back on\
      \ to the lakeside. Jump into the water and swim to beneath the waterfall. Enter\
      \ the now open underwater tunnel beneath the waterfall to exit the level.\n\n\
