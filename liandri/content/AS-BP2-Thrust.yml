      <p>The setting for this mission is a remote island from where the NEG fires\
      \ its rockets. The attacking team must sabotage the launch of one of these rockets\
      \ in 3 steps: Fire the guidance rocket prematurely, stop the rocket from getting\
      \ fuel and then launch it without those 2 crucial factors.\nMost of the mission\
      \ takes place outside with a large variety of vehicles on the attacking team's\
      \ side side against a large amount of Minigun Turrets on the defender's side.\n\
      </p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span><span\

      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Launch\
      \ the Guidance Rocket</dt>\n<dd> The attacking team will spawn with a full arsenal\
      \ of weapons and vehicles. No less than 2 <a href=\"/Scorpion\" title=\"Scorpion\"\
      >Scorpions</a>, a <a href=\"/Hellbender\" title=\"Hellbender\">Hellbender</a>\
      \ and <a href=\"/Goliath\" title=\"Goliath\">Goliath</a> can be used for the\
      \ next objectives. </dd>\n<dd> The Guidance Rocket is located in a small building\
      \ on the right of the dirt track coming from the attacker's base. There are\
      \ a few valuable pickups on the ground floor of the building, which may be needed\
      \ later on. Inside the building a series of slopes on the left side will lead\
      \ to the rooftop (and an enemy <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"\
      Turrets\">Minigun Turret</a> ). The switch is on the left side of the rooftop\
      \ and requires a multi-second presence of an attacker to complete the objective.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The defending team spawns on the opposite side of the field on a high\
      \ platform. A convenient <a href=\"/edit/Jump_Pad?redlink=1\" class=\"new\"\
      \ title=\"Jump Pad (page does not exist)\">Jump Pad</a> will take the defenders\
      \ directly to the Guidance Rocket. The defenders can use 2 Minigun Turrets (1\
      \ near the spawnpoints and the other on the rooftop near the objective) and\
      \ a <a href=\"/Raptor\" title=\"Raptor\">Raptor</a> (also near the spawnpoints).\
      \ The Minigun Turret on the rooftop does not only guard the field in front of\
      \ the building, but the objective and the entire rooftop as well. This makes\
      \ it the best weapon in the defense, but also the first target of the attackers.\
      \ Once the Turret is destroyed the defending team will have to defend the rooftop\
      \ on foot, or with the help of the Raptor. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Place the Explosives\
      \ on the Pressure Tanks</dt>\n<dd> After the Guidance Rocket has been launched\
      \ the attackers will be awarded with another Scorpion and Hellbender. The bridge\
      \ has been extended and the attackers can now cross it to reach the Pressure\
      \ Tanks. Right after crossing the bridge the attackers can choose to take the\
      \ lift or road on the right to the optional objective, which will be explained\
      \ later.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The platform with the Pressure Tanks (which can\
      \ be reached by turning left after crossing the bridge) is defended by a total\
      \ of 3 Minigun Turrets. This also means that, when playing with smaller teams,\
      \ there won't be any footsoldiers left to defend the objective. A destroyed\
      \ Leviathan provides some cover for attackers on foot, who can use a set of\
      \ piers on both sides of the platform to avoid some of the Turrets' fire. 2\
      \ of the Turrets can also rotate to quickly kill any attacker who attempts to\
      \ place the objective. These Turrets, in combination with a new Raptor spawnpoint\
      \ (next to the stairs of the platform) and possible footsoldiers, will give\
      \ the defending team a good shot at stalling the attackers. The attacker's best\
      \ shot of destroying the Turrets would be the use of vehicles or completing\
      \ the optional objective. Footsoldiers can also try to battle the turrets with\
      \ the <a href=\"/AVRiL\" title=\"AVRiL\">AVRiL</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt><i>Optional</i>:\
      \ Destroy SAM Sites</dt>\n<dd> As mentioned before: The road and lift on the\
      \ right side of the road beyond the bridge will lead to a platform with 2 SAM\
      \ sites. Only 1 Minigun Turret guards this optional objective (which won't even\
      \ be used when playing in smaller teams). It takes 6 rockets to destroy a SAM\
      \ site and the attacking team will be rewarded with 2 Hellbenders and a Scorpion.\
      \ The attackers will now also spawn here and will be able to use the weapon\
      \ lockers, 4 <a href=\"/Armor#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\" title=\"Armor\"\
      >Shield packs</a> and the <a href=\"/Health#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Health\">Big Keg O' Health</a>. Last but not least the destruction\
      \ of the SAM sites also triggers an air strike near the Pressure Tanks objective,\
      \ which severely damages the 3 Minigun Turrets there.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The\
      \ defenses in this area are weak. The only Minigun Turret can only protect 1\
      \ of the SAM sites, and even then the vehicular force of the attackers can deal\
      \ with the turret quickly. The defending team can also use the Raptor located\
      \ near the Pressure Tanks to try and protect this objective, as well as the\
      \ <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper Rifle\">Sniper Rifle</a> located\
      \ on a small hill nearby. The large number of Shield Packs along with the Big\
      \ Keg O'Health will give any footsoldier the advantage in man-to-man combat.\
      \  </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Launch the Main Rocket</dt>\n<dd> After the Pressure\
      \ Tanks have gone skybound, the doors to the final objective are opened. Continue\
      \ to walk across the grassy island before making a left turn up a wide slope.\
      \ Keep an eye out for the Minigun Turret on the end of the path, right of the\
      \ slope. This turret will have a clear view on the attackers until after they\
      \ have reached the hall. Inside this hall the defending team has another Minigun\
      \ Turret which, again, guards the objective. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The slope\
      \ gives the defending team a slight advantage, especially with the 2 Turrets\
      \ that overlook most of the slope. Once inside, the attackers can steal a few\
      \ of the Health Pack to increase their chances of completing the objective.\
      \ The defending team can even use one of the turrets from the first objectives\
      \ (near their first spawnpoints). This turret overlooks most of the road to\
      \ the slope near the final objective, though from a great distance. The attackers'\
      \ main offensive against these Turrets is the AVRiL, or a vehicle if the attackers\
      \ still have one nearby. The launch panel is located on the right side of the\
      \ back wall, behind the Turret. It takes an attacker a few seconds to launch\
      \ the rocket and to finish the mission.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

    text: "{{Infobox Map\n| title       = Thrust\n| description = A recreation of\
      \ the infamous destruction of the Saturn IX PCNR rocket where a crack team of\
      \ anti-[[NEG]] rebels stormed the launch facility and scuttled the rocket by\
      \ launching it unguided and half-fueled.\n| mapimage    = AS-BP2-Thrust.gif\n\
      | imagedesc   = Thrust\n| author      = Tynan Sylvester\n| players     = 8-12\n\
      | music       = KR-Hyperblast-Redux\n| games       = [[UT2004]] (MegaPack)\n\
      | gametype    = Assault\n}}\n\n==Map Description==\nThe setting for this mission\
      \ is a remote island from where the NEG fires its rockets. The attacking team\
      \ must sabotage the launch of one of these rockets in 3 steps: Fire the guidance\
      \ rocket prematurely, stop the rocket from getting fuel and then launch it without\
      \ those 2 crucial factors.\nMost of the mission takes place outside with a large\
      \ variety of vehicles on the attacking team's side side against a large amount\
      \ of Minigun Turrets on the defender's side.\n\n==Objectives==\n;Launch the\
      \ Guidance Rocket\n: The attacking team will spawn with a full arsenal of weapons\
      \ and vehicles. No less than 2 [[Scorpion]]s, a [[Hellbender]] and [[Goliath]]\
      \ can be used for the next objectives. \n: The Guidance Rocket is located in\
      \ a small building on the right of the dirt track coming from the attacker's\
      \ base. There are a few valuable pickups on the ground floor of the building,\
      \ which may be needed later on. Inside the building a series of slopes on the\
      \ left side will lead to the rooftop (and an enemy [[Turrets#Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2004|Minigun Turret]] ). The switch is on the left side of the rooftop and\
      \ requires a multi-second presence of an attacker to complete the objective.\n\
      \n: The defending team spawns on the opposite side of the field on a high platform.\
      \ A convenient [[Jump Pad]] will take the defenders directly to the Guidance\
      \ Rocket. The defenders can use 2 Minigun Turrets (1 near the spawnpoints and\
      \ the other on the rooftop near the objective) and a [[Raptor]] (also near the\
      \ spawnpoints). The Minigun Turret on the rooftop does not only guard the field\
      \ in front of the building, but the objective and the entire rooftop as well.\
      \ This makes it the best weapon in the defense, but also the first target of\
      \ the attackers. Once the Turret is destroyed the defending team will have to\
      \ defend the rooftop on foot, or with the help of the Raptor. \n\n;Place the\
      \ Explosives on the Pressure Tanks\n: After the Guidance Rocket has been launched\
      \ the attackers will be awarded with another Scorpion and Hellbender. The bridge\
      \ has been extended and the attackers can now cross it to reach the Pressure\
      \ Tanks. Right after crossing the bridge the attackers can choose to take the\
      \ lift or road on the right to the optional objective, which will be explained\
      \ later.\n\n: The platform with the Pressure Tanks (which can be reached by\
      \ turning left after crossing the bridge) is defended by a total of 3 Minigun\
      \ Turrets. This also means that, when playing with smaller teams, there won't\
      \ be any footsoldiers left to defend the objective. A destroyed Leviathan provides\
      \ some cover for attackers on foot, who can use a set of piers on both sides\
      \ of the platform to avoid some of the Turrets' fire. 2 of the Turrets can also\
      \ rotate to quickly kill any attacker who attempts to place the objective. These\
      \ Turrets, in combination with a new Raptor spawnpoint (next to the stairs of\
      \ the platform) and possible footsoldiers, will give the defending team a good\
      \ shot at stalling the attackers. The attacker's best shot of destroying the\
      \ Turrets would be the use of vehicles or completing the optional objective.\
      \ Footsoldiers can also try to battle the turrets with the [[AVRiL]].\n\n;''Optional''<nowiki>:</nowiki>\
      \ Destroy SAM Sites\n: As mentioned before: The road and lift on the right side\
      \ of the road beyond the bridge will lead to a platform with 2 SAM sites. Only\
      \ 1 Minigun Turret guards this optional objective (which won't even be used\
      \ when playing in smaller teams). It takes 6 rockets to destroy a SAM site and\
      \ the attacking team will be rewarded with 2 Hellbenders and a Scorpion. The\
      \ attackers will now also spawn here and will be able to use the weapon lockers,\
      \ 4 [[Armor#Unreal Tournament 2003 and 2004|Shield packs]] and the [[Health#Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2003 and 2004|Big Keg O' Health]]. Last but not least the destruction\
      \ of the SAM sites also triggers an air strike near the Pressure Tanks objective,\
      \ which severely damages the 3 Minigun Turrets there.\n\n: The defenses in this\
      \ area are weak. The only Minigun Turret can only protect 1 of the SAM sites,\
      \ and even then the vehicular force of the attackers can deal with the turret\
      \ quickly. The defending team can also use the Raptor located near the Pressure\
      \ Tanks to try and protect this objective, as well as the [[Sniper Rifle]] located\
      \ on a small hill nearby. The large number of Shield Packs along with the Big\
      \ Keg O'Health will give any footsoldier the advantage in man-to-man combat.\
      \  \n\n;Launch the Main Rocket\n: After the Pressure Tanks have gone skybound,\
      \ the doors to the final objective are opened. Continue to walk across the grassy\
      \ island before making a left turn up a wide slope. Keep an eye out for the\
      \ Minigun Turret on the end of the path, right of the slope. This turret will\
      \ have a clear view on the attackers until after they have reached the hall.\
      \ Inside this hall the defending team has another Minigun Turret which, again,\
      \ guards the objective. \n\n: The slope gives the defending team a slight advantage,\
      \ especially with the 2 Turrets that overlook most of the slope. Once inside,\
      \ the attackers can steal a few of the Health Pack to increase their chances\
      \ of completing the objective. The defending team can even use one of the turrets\
      \ from the first objectives (near their first spawnpoints). This turret overlooks\
      \ most of the road to the slope near the final objective, though from a great\
      \ distance. The attackers' main offensive against these Turrets is the AVRiL,\
      \ or a vehicle if the attackers still have one nearby. The launch panel is located\
      \ on the right side of the back wall, behind the Turret. It takes an attacker\
      \ a few seconds to launch the rocket and to finish the mission.\n\n== Weapons\

      \n==Tips & tricks==\n;Offensive\n: By far the most powerful weapon of the attackers\
      \ is the Goliath. With the proper protection, the Goliath can be used all the\
      \ way to the final objective, making every objective significantly easier to\
      \ complete. It will take more time to retrieve it after it's been destroyed,\
      \ but it may be worth it in the end.\n\n;Defensive\n: The only vehicle the defending\
      \ team has is the Raptor. Although the Raptor will lose in a battle against\
      \ the full vehicle division of the attacking team, it can be very useful against\
      \ attackers on foot (despite the fact that the attackers always carry an AVRiL).\n\
      \n==Trivia==\n*AS-Thrust was the 1st place winner in the \"Best Assault Level\"\
