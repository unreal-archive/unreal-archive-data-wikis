      \ empty and serve as delivery place for skulls.\n</p><p>While almost all (V)CTF\
      \ layouts work well in Greed, there are also some custom maps with special layout\
      \ for the Greed gametype that would not work in standard (V)CTF. These maps\
      \ usually have a name of the form CTF-GRD-<i>Mapname</i> to identify them as\
      \ Greed maps. Special Greed maps are not restricted to one delivery point per\
      \ team or even the usual \"delivery point in enemy base\" layout.\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The basic rule is to bring collected skulls to the\
      \ delivery point usually found in the enemy base. Each delivered skull scores\
      \ one point for the team, one point for the player and one point for the player's\
      \ <a href=\"/Titan_(mutator)\" title=\"Titan (mutator)\">Titan</a> score. \n\
      Like in CTF, titans are not allowed to pick up skulls. Skulls are not dropped\
      \ when transforming into a titan, but titans cannot deliver their skulls at\
      \ the enemy base. They will drop as usual when the titan player dies.\n</p><p>In\
      \ addition to any carried skulls, players also drop additional skulls when they\
      \ are killed by an opponent. The number of additional skulls depend on whether\
      \ the player is a titan. Also, if the player was killed because of driving a\
      \ vehicle that got destroyed, additional skulls are dropped. Tt reduce the mess\
      \ caused by huge drop counts, players first drop red skulls worth 20 points,\
      \ then gold skulls worth 5 points and finally silver skulls worth 1 point.\n\
      </p>\n<dl><dt>Base drop</dt>\n<dd></dd></dl>\n<ul><li>Behemoth: 20 points</li>\n\

      \ for example, if you kill a Behemoth carrying 6 skulls, the total drop is worth\
      \ 26 skulls (20 for behemoth + 6 carried) and is dropped as 1 red, 1 gold and\
      \ 1 silver skull. Blowing up a vehicle with more than one player, counts as\
      \ separate kills. Assuming a Goliath kill where the driver did not collect any\
      \ skulls and the gunner carries 2, the resulting drops are 7 (regular player\
      \ + Goliath bonus) and 3 (regular player + 2 carried, no turret bonus), dropped\
