      \ people, this article isn't quite informative at all. Look at <a href=\"/Gen_Mo%27Kai\"\

      \ term Cyborg, that is derived from the word Cybernetics, actually means <i>an\
      \ organism that has both artificial and natural systems</i> (see <a href=\"\
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Cyborg\"\
      >Wikipedia</a>). So we should use these nice terms and probably ignore or mention\
      \ how Epic used them wrongly, if they did. Though I guess the term Automatons\
      \ should be used only for Blood Fist, as the Corrupt never mentions this term.\
      \ Probably they could just be called robots (as in AS-RobotFactory). --<a href=\"\
