      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>So... you've survived Decks 4 through 2, and you're here on the top deck.\
      \ What did that log say... get to the deck 1 transporters? And wasn't there\
      \ something about electric force field barriers and a hull breach in the Observation\
      \ Lounge? Time to move on and find out more.\n</p><p>You start off in the corridor\
      \ from the Primary Turbo-Lift. Go through the door and you will be at two large\
      \ information panels [1, 2].\n</p><p>Look ahead and you will see a crossroads\
      \ of corridors with a \"Transformer Room\" ahead. Don't go up to the crossroads\
      \ just yet.\n</p><p>I'll describe the current setting to you. This is a ring\
      \ of corridors. At the far side of the ring the entrance to the rest of the\
      \ map is blocked off by an electric beam. At the other three \"corners\" of\
      \ the ring (including this one) are three \"Transformer Rooms\". Each must be\
      \ deactivated before the beam will disengage. Sounds simple, but to complicate\
      \ matters the corridors are patrolled by a (seemingly) endless supply of <a\
      \ href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScouts</a>.\n\
      </p><p>That first log should have given you a clue. Don't use up all your ammo\
      \ trying to kill all the Skaarj. Instead, follow the next few paragraphs at\
      \ a sprint, only killing Skaarj who actually get in your way (I recommend the\
      \ <a href=\"/Energy_Amplifier\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Energy Amplifier\"\
      >Energy Amplifier</a> and <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"Shock Rifle\">ASMD</a>\
      \ Secondary fire, or Amp &amp; ASMD Combo if there are several Skaarj in a small\
      \ space).\n</p><p>Alternatively, if you have enough ammo for your explosive\
      \ weapons, you can just blast those <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScouts</a> in starting room. You should had\
      \ no problem with ammo supply later game even if you \"waste\" some. Playing\
      \ Unreal difficulty, there comes about 15. For Hard or Unreal difficulty levels,\
      \ I prefer killing them in first corridor instead of hide and destroy tactics.\n\
      </p><p>Sprint to the junction. Enter Transporter Room 1, where a monitor gives\
      \ you a message [3].\n</p><p>Press the button to deactivate the Transformer\
      \ Room. Collect of the 2 Health Packs in this room if you need them (I didn't\
      \ because I still had a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a> and &gt;100 Health from the previous map). Leave\
      \ the room and go anticlockwise round the corridor ring until you reach Transformer\
      \ Room 2. Enter and deactivate this second room, collecting 2 more Health Packs\
      \ if necessary. Follow the corridor ring further round past the beam-protected\
      \ exit until you enter Transformer Room 3. Collect of the <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\"\
      \ title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a> and 4 Health Packs here then deactivate\
      \ this final transformer room. The electric beam should have been deactivated\
      \ now, if you were to return to room 1 (which you shouldn't unless you need\
      \ health), the monitor would have changed [4].\n</p><p>Return to the now open\
      \ exit, pass through, then immediately press the button on the wall beyond to\
      \ reactivate the electrical field so that you are not followed.\n</p><p>The\
      \ lab itself is behind a hefty locked metal door in front. Another ring of corridors\
      \ goes around the outside of the lab, so head clockwise. As you round the first\
      \ corner you will see two beefy <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjOfficers</a>. SkaarjOfficers normally carry <a href=\"\
      /Ripper\" title=\"Ripper\">Razorjacks</a> but these ones only have <a href=\"\
      /Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistols</a>; count\
      \ yourself lucky.\n</p><p>Round the other way from the beam-protected entrance\
      \ (anticlockwise round the ring) is a door labelled \"Crew Berths\", but it\
      \ is locked. Thus your only route from here is to go through the entrance on\
      \ the ring opposite where you came in. You will arrive in a foyer with wooden\
      \ crates at the base of a pair of metal ramps containing two Clips. If you look\
      \ up the ramps you will see two corridors blocked at the far end by force fields,\
      \ either side of a sign that says \"Bridge\". If you go down the right of the\
      \ two corridors, you will find an information panel that explains the force\
      \ fields [5].\n</p><p>Only one way to go then. Continue up the ramps; you will\
      \ find your path blocked by wooden crates that you must shoot out of the way.\
      \ Follow through and you will be on a raised walkway above the lab corridor\
      \ ring below.\n</p><p>Going clockwise round the walkway, you will find four\
      \ <a href=\"/Bandage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bandage\">Bandages</a>\
      \ behind metal barrels. Going anticlockwise as an alternative, an <a href=\"\
      /Enforcer\" title=\"Enforcer\">Automag</a> behind further metal barrels. Either\
      \ way, you will arrive ultimately at a glowing control panel with a view of\
      \ the lab doors. Activate it and the huge lab doors slowly open. Drop down to\
      \ the main corridor ring and enter.\n</p><p>In the lab, a button at the unbreakable\
      \ window on the right opens the Crew Berths door beyond. The lab doors will\
      \ have started to close soon after you entered, but if you are quick then you\
      \ can be in and out of the lab before the doors close then through the Crew\
      \ Berths door before that closes too. Alternatively, you can stick around and\
      \ get full results out of the room you are now in.\n</p><p>First, walk round\
      \ the raised section of the lab and collect of the can of 12 Eightballs and\
      \ three Bandages here. If you press the Crew Berths button you will see the\
      \ Crew Berths door open temporarily beyond but you will be unable to reach it\
      \ because you are now locked in. Look instead to the centre of the lab; two\
      \ containment fields contain a collection of about six <a href=\"/Bloblet\"\
      \ title=\"Bloblet\">Bloblets</a>. Go to the lower section and investigate the\
      \ three panels from left to right [6, 7].\n</p><p>The third panel is a control\
      \ panel. Activate it and get up the ramp on to the raised area. Shortly the\
      \ fields will drop and the Bloblets will attack you. These close range attack\
      \ creatures are difficult to target, so I recommend keeping your distance and\
      \ using Eightballs to kill them. Soon the lab doors will start to grind open.\
      \ Press the Crew Berths button then leave the lab and get through the Crew Berths\
      \ door before it closes.\n</p><p>On the walkway beyond, you can drop down to\
      \ some maintenance areas below. Mind the engine coolant. Collect from dry land\
      \ here 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 50 Bullets. A service duct is your exit\
      \ from this area, but first check your HUD to see if you still possess a <a\
      \ href=\"/Toxin_Suit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Toxin Suit\">Toxin Suit</a>.\
      \ If so, dip into the coolant. Visit either end of the stream. At one end is\
      \ a can of 12 Eightballs. More importantly, open wooden crates at the other\
      \ end to collect a box of 10 Flak Shells and an <a href=\"/Invisibility\" title=\"\
      Invisibility\">Invisibility</a> powerup.\n</p><p>Climb out of the coolant and\
      \ go up to the service duct entrance. Enter when the grate is open and go up\
      \ the next lift, via 40 Tarydium Shards. Following the ducts through, you will\
      \ be in a raised area overlooking the Scientific Research Lab and its surrounding\
      \ corridor ring. Try not to fall off yet; lowered sections of walkway here have\
      \ crates containing two Health Packs and a box of 10 Flak Shells, plus steps\
      \ back to the main raised section.\n</p><p>At the far side of the raised area\
      \ from the point at which you entered, a wooden crate contains <a href=\"/Jump_Boots\"\
      \ title=\"Jump Boots\">Jump Boots</a>. Collect these then, standing on the roof\
      \ of the lab, jump up on to the roof beams to grab a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> (you\
      \ may need to use a <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a>\
      \ to do this).\n</p><p>Drop back down to the main walkway of this raised area.\
      \ Follow it round until you see a recess where you can drop down a step to an\
      \ <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault\
      \ Vest</a>.\n</p><p>Drop down on to this roof and collect the Assault Vest,\
      \ Razorjack and two boxes of Razor Blades here. Drop down one stage further\
      \ and you will be in the vicinity of the glowing control panel you used to initially\
      \ open the lab. You need to visit the lab again to open the Crew Berths door,\
      \ so open the lab doors, dart in, open the Crew Berths doors, then come quickly\
      \ back out and return to the main Crew Berths walkway.\n</p><p>Following said\
      \ walkway, you will shortly arrive at a crossroads. This next room is optional,\
      \ but do it anyway. Go through the door on the left. As you enter the darkened\
      \ crew berth, you will see a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a> operating a console at the far side. The\
      \ Skaarj will see you but the console will explode, probably killing it (you\
      \ may need to finish it off yourself). Collect a Clip from by the console, a\
      \ Stinger from atop a crate in the darkest area of the crew berth, and an ASMD\
      \ Core from near the entrance.\n</p><p>Go back out to the corridor; watch out\
      \ for a pair of <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\"\
      >SkaarjTroopers</a> with Dispersion Pistols who may have appeared. Then, go\
      \ across the walkway and into the other crew berth. This one may seem empty\
      \ but as you venture deeper into the room you will be ambushed by a SkaarjScout,\
      \ so watch out.\nWithin this room, three ASMD Cores stand atop a large crate\
      \ in the middle (these cores can only be reached using the Jump Boots mentioned\
      \ previously, or by weapon jump). In a corner of this room are 40 Tarydium Shards\
      \ and wooden crates containing a Clip. There's also an information panel [8].\n\
      </p><p>Leave the crew berth and turn right, going to the far end of the walkway.\
      \ One door later, you will be in a room where a Dispersion Pistol-armed SkaarjOfficer\
      \ guards a room with two lifts to a walkway above. Kill the Skaarj. Before using\
      \ the lifts, open crates to get two Bandages and two Health Packs.\n</p><p>Ride\
      \ the lifts. A door ahead at the top is labelled \"Observation Lounge\", but\
      \ before going through, jump down the crates on the left to get two boxes of\
      \ 10 Flak Shells. Return up the lifts and enter the Observation Lounge.\n</p><p>The\
      \ Observation Lounge is the location of a hull breach; rock and water have entered\
      \ the room. As you enter this area the ship will start to be racked by earthquakes;\
      \ ignore them. To the right, a crate beneath some rock contains an ASMD Core\
      \ which you can collect. There is a panel to the left [9].\n</p><p>Things are\
      \ hotting up. Go into the water; crates here reveal 40 Tarydium Shards. Head\
      \ over to a grate in the submerged floor held in place by a yellow clamp. Push\
      \ the clamp to open the grate, As you open the grate, a SkaarjTrooper with a\
      \ Dispersion Pistol may appear in the door. Kill it.\nDive down into the submerged\
      \ shaft you have opened and read the information panel at the bottom [10].\n\
      </p><p>Go along the shaft and activate the control panel at the end. The information\
      \ panel changes [11].\n</p><p>Surface and kill the SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion\
      \ Pistol that has appeared. Leave the Observation Lounge and sprint to the far\
      \ end of the Crew Berths corridor. Leave the Crew Berths area and make a right,\
      \ returning to the previously blocked entrance to the Bridge foyer. This information\
      \ panel too has changed [12].\n</p><p>Enter the Bridge foyer and collect the\
      \ ASMD from a corpse here. Ride one of the two lifts and kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ guarding the bridge access at the top.\n</p><p>On the Bridge, there are switches\
      \ to either side on the walls. Press one and drop down the revealed hole into\
      \ the emergency transporter room below, where there are two information panels\
      \ [13, 14].\n</p><p>Step on to the pad. After a few special effects, you have\
      \ teleported out of the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

    text: "[[Image:ISVKranDeck1.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]\n'''ISV-Kran Deck 1''' is\
      \ the seventeenth map in [[Unreal|Unreal's]] single player game.\n; Author :\
      \ [[Myscha the Sled Dog]]\n; Description\n: Finding no survivors, the player\
      \ makes his way towards the bridge of the tortured Terran vessel ISV-Kran as\
      \ the engines break down and the ship begins to collapse. Skaarj infest the\
      \ ventilation system, and within the science and research lab, strange alien\
      \ amoebas pulsate within the failing containment fields.\n; Note\n: This map\
      \ is described in-game as \"ISVDeck1\" rather than \"ISV-Kran Deck 1\"; however,\
      \ given the naming of the other maps in the sequence, this is held to be a mistake.\n\

      \ Trooper]]\n\n\n\n==Walkthrough==\n''This walkthrough was completed on Medium\
      \ difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\
      \nSo... you've survived Decks 4 through 2, and you're here on the top deck.\
      \ What did that log say... get to the deck 1 transporters? And wasn't there\
      \ something about electric force field barriers and a hull breach in the Observation\
      \ Lounge? Time to move on and find out more.\n\nYou start off in the corridor\
      \ from the Primary Turbo-Lift. Go through the door and you will be at two large\
      \ information panels [1, 2].\n\nLook ahead and you will see a crossroads of\
      \ corridors with a \"Transformer Room\" ahead. Don't go up to the crossroads\
      \ just yet.\n\nI'll describe the current setting to you. This is a ring of corridors.\
      \ At the far side of the ring the entrance to the rest of the map is blocked\
      \ off by an electric beam. At the other three \"corners\" of the ring (including\
      \ this one) are three \"Transformer Rooms\". Each must be deactivated before\
      \ the beam will disengage. Sounds simple, but to complicate matters the corridors\
      \ are patrolled by a (seemingly) endless supply of [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScouts]].\n\
      \nThat first log should have given you a clue. Don't use up all your ammo trying\
      \ to kill all the Skaarj. Instead, follow the next few paragraphs at a sprint,\
      \ only killing Skaarj who actually get in your way (I recommend the [[Energy\
      \ Amplifier]] and [[Shock Rifle|ASMD]] Secondary fire, or Amp & ASMD Combo if\
      \ there are several Skaarj in a small space).\n\nAlternatively, if you have\
      \ enough ammo for your explosive weapons, you can just blast those [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScouts]]\
      \ in starting room. You should had no problem with ammo supply later game even\
      \ if you \"waste\" some. Playing Unreal difficulty, there comes about 15. For\
      \ Hard or Unreal difficulty levels, I prefer killing them in first corridor\
      \ instead of hide and destroy tactics.\n\nSprint to the junction. Enter Transporter\
      \ Room 1, where a monitor gives you a message [3].\n\nPress the button to deactivate\
      \ the Transformer Room. Collect of the 2 Health Packs in this room if you need\
      \ them (I didn't because I still had a [[Shield Belt]] and >100 Health from\
      \ the previous map). Leave the room and go anticlockwise round the corridor\
      \ ring until you reach Transformer Room 2. Enter and deactivate this second\
      \ room, collecting 2 more Health Packs if necessary. Follow the corridor ring\
      \ further round past the beam-protected exit until you enter Transformer Room\
      \ 3. Collect of the [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Gun]] and 4 Health Packs here\
      \ then deactivate this final transformer room. The electric beam should have\
      \ been deactivated now, if you were to return to room 1 (which you shouldn't\
      \ unless you need health), the monitor would have changed [4].\n\nReturn to\
      \ the now open exit, pass through, then immediately press the button on the\
      \ wall beyond to reactivate the electrical field so that you are not followed.\n\
      \nThe lab itself is behind a hefty locked metal door in front. Another ring\
      \ of corridors goes around the outside of the lab, so head clockwise. As you\
      \ round the first corner you will see two beefy [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer|SkaarjOfficers]].\
      \ SkaarjOfficers normally carry [[Ripper|Razorjacks]] but these ones only have\
      \ [[Dispersion Pistol|Dispersion Pistols]]; count yourself lucky.\n\nRound the\
      \ other way from the beam-protected entrance (anticlockwise round the ring)\
      \ is a door labelled \"Crew Berths\", but it is locked. Thus your only route\
      \ from here is to go through the entrance on the ring opposite where you came\
      \ in. You will arrive in a foyer with wooden crates at the base of a pair of\
      \ metal ramps containing two Clips. If you look up the ramps you will see two\
      \ corridors blocked at the far end by force fields, either side of a sign that\
      \ says \"Bridge\". If you go down the right of the two corridors, you will find\
      \ an information panel that explains the force fields [5].\n\nOnly one way to\
      \ go then. Continue up the ramps; you will find your path blocked by wooden\
      \ crates that you must shoot out of the way. Follow through and you will be\
      \ on a raised walkway above the lab corridor ring below.\n\nGoing clockwise\
      \ round the walkway, you will find four [[Bandage|Bandages]] behind metal barrels.\
      \ Going anticlockwise as an alternative, an [[Enforcer|Automag]] behind further\
      \ metal barrels. Either way, you will arrive ultimately at a glowing control\
      \ panel with a view of the lab doors. Activate it and the huge lab doors slowly\
      \ open. Drop down to the main corridor ring and enter.\n\nIn the lab, a button\
      \ at the unbreakable window on the right opens the Crew Berths door beyond.\
      \ The lab doors will have started to close soon after you entered, but if you\
      \ are quick then you can be in and out of the lab before the doors close then\
      \ through the Crew Berths door before that closes too. Alternatively, you can\
      \ stick around and get full results out of the room you are now in.\n\nFirst,\
      \ walk round the raised section of the lab and collect of the can of 12 Eightballs\
      \ and three Bandages here. If you press the Crew Berths button you will see\
      \ the Crew Berths door open temporarily beyond but you will be unable to reach\
      \ it because you are now locked in. Look instead to the centre of the lab; two\
      \ containment fields contain a collection of about six [[Bloblet|Bloblets]].\
      \ Go to the lower section and investigate the three panels from left to right\
      \ [6, 7].\n\nThe third panel is a control panel. Activate it and get up the\
      \ ramp on to the raised area. Shortly the fields will drop and the Bloblets\
      \ will attack you. These close range attack creatures are difficult to target,\
      \ so I recommend keeping your distance and using Eightballs to kill them. Soon\
      \ the lab doors will start to grind open. Press the Crew Berths button then\
      \ leave the lab and get through the Crew Berths door before it closes.\n\nOn\
      \ the walkway beyond, you can drop down to some maintenance areas below. Mind\
      \ the engine coolant. Collect from dry land here 40 Tarydium Shards and a box\
      \ of 50 Bullets. A service duct is your exit from this area, but first check\
      \ your HUD to see if you still possess a [[Toxin Suit]]. If so, dip into the\
      \ coolant. Visit either end of the stream. At one end is a can of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ More importantly, open wooden crates at the other end to collect a box of\
      \ 10 Flak Shells and an [[Invisibility]] powerup.\n\nClimb out of the coolant\
      \ and go up to the service duct entrance. Enter when the grate is open and go\
      \ up the next lift, via 40 Tarydium Shards. Following the ducts through, you\
      \ will be in a raised area overlooking the Scientific Research Lab and its surrounding\
      \ corridor ring. Try not to fall off yet; lowered sections of walkway here have\
      \ crates containing two Health Packs and a box of 10 Flak Shells, plus steps\
      \ back to the main raised section.\n\nAt the far side of the raised area from\
      \ the point at which you entered, a wooden crate contains [[Jump Boots]]. Collect\
      \ these then, standing on the roof of the lab, jump up on to the roof beams\
      \ to grab a [[Super Health Pack]] (you may need to use a [[Flashlight]] to do\
      \ this).\n\nDrop back down to the main walkway of this raised area. Follow it\
      \ round until you see a recess where you can drop down a step to an [[Assault\
      \ Vest]].\n\nDrop down on to this roof and collect the Assault Vest, Razorjack\
      \ and two boxes of Razor Blades here. Drop down one stage further and you will\
      \ be in the vicinity of the glowing control panel you used to initially open\
      \ the lab. You need to visit the lab again to open the Crew Berths door, so\
      \ open the lab doors, dart in, open the Crew Berths doors, then come quickly\
      \ back out and return to the main Crew Berths walkway.\n\nFollowing said walkway,\
      \ you will shortly arrive at a crossroads. This next room is optional, but do\
      \ it anyway. Go through the door on the left. As you enter the darkened crew\
      \ berth, you will see a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]] operating\
      \ a console at the far side. The Skaarj will see you but the console will explode,\
      \ probably killing it (you may need to finish it off yourself). Collect a Clip\
      \ from by the console, a Stinger from atop a crate in the darkest area of the\
      \ crew berth, and an ASMD Core from near the entrance.\n\nGo back out to the\
      \ corridor; watch out for a pair of [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper|SkaarjTroopers]]\
      \ with Dispersion Pistols who may have appeared. Then, go across the walkway\
      \ and into the other crew berth. This one may seem empty but as you venture\
      \ deeper into the room you will be ambushed by a SkaarjScout, so watch out.\n\
      Within this room, three ASMD Cores stand atop a large crate in the middle (these\
      \ cores can only be reached using the Jump Boots mentioned previously, or by\
      \ weapon jump). In a corner of this room are 40 Tarydium Shards and wooden crates\
      \ containing a Clip. There's also an information panel [8].\n\nLeave the crew\
      \ berth and turn right, going to the far end of the walkway. One door later,\
      \ you will be in a room where a Dispersion Pistol-armed SkaarjOfficer guards\
      \ a room with two lifts to a walkway above. Kill the Skaarj. Before using the\
      \ lifts, open crates to get two Bandages and two Health Packs.\n\nRide the lifts.\
      \ A door ahead at the top is labelled \"Observation Lounge\", but before going\
      \ through, jump down the crates on the left to get two boxes of 10 Flak Shells.\
      \ Return up the lifts and enter the Observation Lounge.\n\nThe Observation Lounge\
      \ is the location of a hull breach; rock and water have entered the room. As\
      \ you enter this area the ship will start to be racked by earthquakes; ignore\
      \ them. To the right, a crate beneath some rock contains an ASMD Core which\
      \ you can collect. There is a panel to the left [9].\n\nThings are hotting up.\
      \ Go into the water; crates here reveal 40 Tarydium Shards. Head over to a grate\
      \ in the submerged floor held in place by a yellow clamp. Push the clamp to\
      \ open the grate, As you open the grate, a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol\
      \ may appear in the door. Kill it.\nDive down into the submerged shaft you have\
      \ opened and read the information panel at the bottom [10].\n\nGo along the\
      \ shaft and activate the control panel at the end. The information panel changes\
      \ [11].\n\nSurface and kill the SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol that\
      \ has appeared. Leave the Observation Lounge and sprint to the far end of the\
      \ Crew Berths corridor. Leave the Crew Berths area and make a right, returning\
      \ to the previously blocked entrance to the Bridge foyer. This information panel\
      \ too has changed [12].\n\nEnter the Bridge foyer and collect the ASMD from\
      \ a corpse here. Ride one of the two lifts and kill the SkaarjWarrior guarding\
      \ the bridge access at the top.\n\nOn the Bridge, there are switches to either\
      \ side on the walls. Press one and drop down the revealed hole into the emergency\
      \ transporter room below, where there are two information panels [13, 14].\n\
      \nStep on to the pad. After a few special effects, you have teleported out of\
      \ the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"ISV-KRAN DECK 1: Log Entry: Captain\
