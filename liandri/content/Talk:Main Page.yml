      \ a project basically like this, but got lazy and didn't finish it. However,\
      \ we did extract a lot of information and images, which can be transferred over\
      \ here. We were using PHPWiki, though, so it's not exactly just copy and paste.\
      \ The main problem is that it's currently only running off my machine and bandwidth,\
      \ so I don't really want to just link to it here. If you guys are interested\
      \ and BU is willing to give a little space for me to upload it so the information\
      \ can be sapped out, that'd be great; otherwise, feel free to MSN messenger/email\
      \ me at gnomre at gmail dot com for the link. [[User:Gnomre|Gnomre]] 22:37,\

      \ (such as \"Operation Na Pali\", \"Xidia\" etc.) which don't follow \"canon\"\
      ? [[User:Texcarson|Texcarson]] 16:04, 18 December 2007 (EST)\n\nI think it would\
      \ be reasonable to include information about notable custom content, such as\
      \ the examples you gave and things such as the community bonus packs and things\
      \ included with the GOTY or ECE versions of the games.  As long as it is clear\
      \ that it is separate and not part of the official game or storyline. --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]]\
      \ 16:26, 18 December 2007 (EST)\n\n:I thought LA was a wiki about the Unreal\
      \ Universe canon only. I'm not sure if mods should get their page, unless coming\
      \ in one of UT*'s [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease\
      \ updated rereleases], and I'm not sure to which extent the [http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfWikiExpansion\
      \ law of wiki expansion] should apply.\n\n== Hot topics ==\n\nI've been thinking\
      \ about this for a while now, and I think it'd be a good idea to reset the number\
      \ of views (that count for the hot topic section) every now and then. Perhaps\
      \ every month, or maybe even every week.\nBecause this list is not ever going\
      \ to change. UT3 will still be at the top even if it won't have any views for\
      \ the next months. --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]] 17:30, 1 February 2008 (EST)\n\
      \nThere isn't a good way for me to change what the list on the front page shows\
      \ without manually reseting values in the database, which I don't plan on doing.\
      \ --[[User:Haarg|Haarg]] 19:51, 1 February 2008 (EST)\n\n== Category links ==\n\
      \nI believe the categories in the main page (Hot Topics, Recent Updates etc)\
      \ should link to their Special pages (ex. Recent Updates -> [[Special:Recentchanges]]).\
      \ Also, a link to all [[Special:Specialpages|Special Pages]] would be useful.\
      \ Maybe some more special pages could be listed there, like [[Special:Search]]\
      \ and [[Special:Deadendpages]]. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 17:52,\

      \ 11:11, 5 June 2008 (EDT)\n:I'd support an article of the week or month. Don't\

      \ Prometheus level,under the name The Trench (RTNP Level). I moved all the materials\
      \ over, but as I am not an admin I cannot delete it. I posted here because unless\
