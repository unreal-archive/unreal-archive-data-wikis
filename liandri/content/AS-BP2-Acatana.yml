      <p>This scenario largely takes place in a research facility on a remote asteroid.\
      \ To reach this asteroid the attackers must first disable the asteroid's defense\
      \ system in a space battle. After having landed on the asteroid's surface the\
      \ attacking team must overrun the facility and steal a set of blueprints from\
      \ the weapons laboratory.  \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\"\
      >Objectives</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/AS-BP2-Acatana?section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Objectives\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Destroy\
      \ the Ship Engines</dt>\n<dd> For the first objective both teams are put in\
      \ Space Fighters. The attackers (using <a href=\"/Skaarj_Space_Fighter\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Space Fighter\">Skaarj Space Fighters</a> ) must destroy a total of 4\
      \ engines. These engines are mounted near the rear of the ships, on both sides.\
      \ Because the engines are very weak and exposed, it is easy to destroy them\
      \ from a distance.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Both ships each have 4 <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Link Turrets</a> and 3 <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Energy Turrets</a>. In total there are 4 Link Turrets and\
      \ 4 Energy Turrets that overlook the battlefield in between the 2 ships, to\
      \ compensate the engine's vulnerability. The defenders can also use <a href=\"\
      /Human_Space_Fighter\" title=\"Human Space Fighter\">Human Space Fighters</a>\
      \ to battle the attackers. These are located outside the hanger, and thus require\
      \ a little more time to reach.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Open the Security Gate</dt>\n\
      <dd> After spawning on the planet's surface the attackers must continue afoot.\
      \ The defending team will be waiting on the other side of a bridge, nearby the\
      \ gate's switch. The attackers can use a pipe to the right of the bridge, or\
      \ the supports of the bridge itself to diverse the defenders' attention. The\
      \ switch is located inside a hangar on the right side of the clearing. </dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The defending team can use the 2 <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Minigun Turrets</a> to try and stall the attackers. The\
      \ Turret's effectiveness is undermined by their limited view on the objective,\
      \ as well as the attacker's swift movement. Other, more useful items include\
      \ the <a href=\"/Armor#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\" title=\"Armor\">Shield\
      \ pack</a> near the defending team's spawnpoints and a <a href=\"/UDamage\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UDamage\">UDamage</a> pickup in one of the crates\
      \ near the bridge.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Blow up the Main Doors</dt>\n<dd> Another\
      \ right turn after passing the gate will take the attackers to their next objective.\
      \ The defending team has respawned in the building to the left of this door,\
      \ guaranteeing a safe passage to the <a href=\"/Armor#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Armor\">Super Shield pack</a> between the 2 crates on the left.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> This field is, just like the last one, guarded by 2 Minigun Turrets:\
      \ 1 of which also guards the objective. It only takes a few seconds for the\
      \ explosives to be placed, so the Turret alone is not enough to stop a group\
      \ of attackers trying to reach the objective. The defending team also has a\
      \ Super Shield pack to use, as well as a superior weapon set. There are also\
      \ a few explosive barrels near the door that the defenders may want to try to\
      \ utilize. Last but not least, the weapon loadout in the defending team's spawnroom\
      \ includes the <a href=\"/Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"Grenade Launcher\">Grenade\
      \ Launcher</a>, which can be a great weapon for setting up ambushes and protecting\
      \ the objective.  </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy the Reactor Core</dt>\n<dd> 2\
      \ Reactor Cores are preventing access to the Weapons Lab. 1 of these cores is\
      \ on the ground level, while the other one can be reached either via the jumppad\
      \ to the right (right after entering the facility) or via the lift in the reactor\
      \ room itself. The first route deserves a recommendation because of the handy\
      \ UDamage pickup placed on the platform in the main hall. The cores do not take\
      \ that long to destroy: 16 rockets are enough to take one down. With the help\
      \ of the Udamage this should be even quicker.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending\
      \ team will be intercepting the attackers in the 2nd part of the main hall.\
      \ They have another Minigun Turret, which the attackers can avoid by taking\
      \ the high route. There is also a Shield Pack on this route, near the defenders'\
      \ spawnpoints. Because the defending team still spawns from the same room as\
      \ the last objective, they can also still get the Super Shield Pack and use\
      \ the Grenade Launcher to stall the attackers.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Steal the\
      \ Weapon Blueprints</dt>\n<dd> The doors to the weapons lab are now open. When\
      \ exiting the reactor room, turn left twice to get to a small corridor with\
      \ a Super Shield Pack near an exit. This exit leads to a large hallway leading\
      \ to the room with the Blueprints. The defending team will be waiting near the\
      \ entrances to this blueprint room. Walk up to the large missile and touch the\
      \ small object floating in front of the red panel to complete the objective</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The defending team will respawn in the blueprints room, where they\
      \ will have some time to gear up. There are 2 Shield packs in this room to help\
      \ the defenders. There's also a Super Shield Pack on the other side of the glass\
      \ hallway which a swift moving defender may be able to grab before the attackers\
      \ reach it. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Escape with the Blueprints</dt>\n<dd> Now the\
      \ Blueprints must be carried back the the main entrance of the building. If\
      \ the carrier dies (s)he drops the blueprints. Another team member can then\
      \ pick them up from where the previous carrier died and continue to walk to\
      \ the entrance. The crates in the glass hallway will provide decent cover for\
      \ the first part. The stretch through the main hall to the entrance is a bit\
      \ longer, but the doorway from the glass hallway to the main hall is easy to\
      \ defend with a few well-equipped attackers. After the entrance has been reached\
      \ a cutscene will follow showing the escape of the attackers and the end of\
      \ the match.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending team does not have a major advantage\
      \ for these last 2 objectives. The Sniper post near the Blueprints room will\
      \ give the defenders a limited view (limited because of all the crates obstructing\
      \ the view) on the glass hallway. The Grenade Launchers in the weapon lockers\
      \ give the defending team the chance to plan an ambush near the blueprint room's\
      \ entrances. The defending team would do best to try and prevent the attackers\
      \ from reaching the room in the first place, for the final objective (trying\
      \ to prevent them from reaching the entrance of the building) is significantly\
      \ harder to defend.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons_and_Pickups\"\

      \ respawned in a hideout near the objective. This means that the teams are placed\
      \ at both ends of a route/field, while occasionally valuable pickups are placed\
      \ somewhere in the middle. The UDamage in the 2nd objective, Super Shield Pack\
      \ for the second-last objective and the Shield Pack on the route to the Reactor\
      \ Room are good examples. These pickups will give the holder (and thus his/her\
      \ entire team) a significant advantage in battle. A good knowledge of the location\
      \ of these pickups can be crucial in this scenario.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

    text: "{{Infobox Map\n| title       = Invasion of Acatana\n| description = Due\
      \ to the treacherous asteroid field and the advanced defense systems surrounding\
      \ the Acatana research facility, no intruders had been near the planet for years.\
      \  When the Skaarj Marauders heard rumors of a highly lucrative technology hidden\
      \ there, they decided to make it their own.  This scenario recreates the Skaarj\
      \ attack on the Acatana research facility, and the battle to penetrate the planet's\
      \ asteroid field.\n| mapimage    = AS-BP2-Acatana.gif\n| imagedesc   = Invasion\
      \ of Acatana\n| author      = Dave Kostiuk\n| players     = 8-12\n| music  \
      \     = KR-Assault\n| games       = [[UT2004]] (MegaPack)\n| gametype    = Assault\n\
      }}\n\n==Map Description==\nThis scenario largely takes place in a research facility\
      \ on a remote asteroid. To reach this asteroid the attackers must first disable\
      \ the asteroid's defense system in a space battle. After having landed on the\
      \ asteroid's surface the attacking team must overrun the facility and steal\
      \ a set of blueprints from the weapons laboratory.  \n\n==Objectives==\n;Destroy\
      \ the Ship Engines\n: For the first objective both teams are put in Space Fighters.\
      \ The attackers (using [[Skaarj Space Fighter]]s ) must destroy a total of 4\
      \ engines. These engines are mounted near the rear of the ships, on both sides.\
      \ Because the engines are very weak and exposed, it is easy to destroy them\
      \ from a distance.\n\n: Both ships each have 4 [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Link\
      \ Turrets]] and 3 [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Energy Turrets]]. In total\
      \ there are 4 Link Turrets and 4 Energy Turrets that overlook the battlefield\
      \ in between the 2 ships, to compensate the engine's vulnerability. The defenders\
      \ can also use [[Human Space Fighter]]s to battle the attackers. These are located\
      \ outside the hanger, and thus require a little more time to reach.\n\n;Open\
      \ the Security Gate\n: After spawning on the planet's surface the attackers\
      \ must continue afoot. The defending team will be waiting on the other side\
      \ of a bridge, nearby the gate's switch. The attackers can use a pipe to the\
      \ right of the bridge, or the supports of the bridge itself to diverse the defenders'\
      \ attention. The switch is located inside a hangar on the right side of the\
      \ clearing. \n\n: The defending team can use the 2 [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Minigun\
      \ Turrets]] to try and stall the attackers. The Turret's effectiveness is undermined\
      \ by their limited view on the objective, as well as the attacker's swift movement.\
      \ Other, more useful items include the [[Armor#Unreal Tournament 2003 and 2004|Shield\
      \ pack]] near the defending team's spawnpoints and a [[UDamage]] pickup in one\
      \ of the crates near the bridge.\n\n;Blow up the Main Doors\n: Another right\
      \ turn after passing the gate will take the attackers to their next objective.\
      \ The defending team has respawned in the building to the left of this door,\
      \ guaranteeing a safe passage to the [[Armor#Unreal Tournament 2003 and 2004|Super\
      \ Shield pack]] between the 2 crates on the left.\n\n: This field is, just like\
      \ the last one, guarded by 2 Minigun Turrets: 1 of which also guards the objective.\
      \ It only takes a few seconds for the explosives to be placed, so the Turret\
      \ alone is not enough to stop a group of attackers trying to reach the objective.\
      \ The defending team also has a Super Shield pack to use, as well as a superior\
      \ weapon set. There are also a few explosive barrels near the door that the\
      \ defenders may want to try to utilize. Last but not least, the weapon loadout\
      \ in the defending team's spawnroom includes the [[Grenade Launcher]], which\
      \ can be a great weapon for setting up ambushes and protecting the objective.\
      \  \n\n;Destroy the Reactor Core\n: 2 Reactor Cores are preventing access to\
      \ the Weapons Lab. 1 of these cores is on the ground level, while the other\
      \ one can be reached either via the jumppad to the right (right after entering\
      \ the facility) or via the lift in the reactor room itself. The first route\
      \ deserves a recommendation because of the handy UDamage pickup placed on the\
      \ platform in the main hall. The cores do not take that long to destroy: 16\
      \ rockets are enough to take one down. With the help of the Udamage this should\
      \ be even quicker.\n\n: The defending team will be intercepting the attackers\
      \ in the 2nd part of the main hall. They have another Minigun Turret, which\
      \ the attackers can avoid by taking the high route. There is also a Shield Pack\
      \ on this route, near the defenders' spawnpoints. Because the defending team\
      \ still spawns from the same room as the last objective, they can also still\
      \ get the Super Shield Pack and use the Grenade Launcher to stall the attackers.\n\
      \n;Steal the Weapon Blueprints\n: The doors to the weapons lab are now open.\
      \ When exiting the reactor room, turn left twice to get to a small corridor\
      \ with a Super Shield Pack near an exit. This exit leads to a large hallway\
      \ leading to the room with the Blueprints. The defending team will be waiting\
      \ near the entrances to this blueprint room. Walk up to the large missile and\
      \ touch the small object floating in front of the red panel to complete the\
      \ objective\n\n: The defending team will respawn in the blueprints room, where\
      \ they will have some time to gear up. There are 2 Shield packs in this room\
      \ to help the defenders. There's also a Super Shield Pack on the other side\
      \ of the glass hallway which a swift moving defender may be able to grab before\
      \ the attackers reach it. \n\n;Escape with the Blueprints\n: Now the Blueprints\
      \ must be carried back the the main entrance of the building. If the carrier\
      \ dies (s)he drops the blueprints. Another team member can then pick them up\
      \ from where the previous carrier died and continue to walk to the entrance.\
      \ The crates in the glass hallway will provide decent cover for the first part.\
      \ The stretch through the main hall to the entrance is a bit longer, but the\
      \ doorway from the glass hallway to the main hall is easy to defend with a few\
      \ well-equipped attackers. After the entrance has been reached a cutscene will\
      \ follow showing the escape of the attackers and the end of the match.\n\n:\
      \ The defending team does not have a major advantage for these last 2 objectives.\
      \ The Sniper post near the Blueprints room will give the defenders a limited\
      \ view (limited because of all the crates obstructing the view) on the glass\
      \ hallway. The Grenade Launchers in the weapon lockers give the defending team\
      \ the chance to plan an ambush near the blueprint room's entrances. The defending\
      \ team would do best to try and prevent the attackers from reaching the room\
      \ in the first place, for the final objective (trying to prevent them from reaching\
      \ the entrance of the building) is significantly harder to defend.\n\n== Weapons\
      \ and Pickups ==\n=== Weapons ===\n* 2x [[Link Gun]] ammo.\n* 2x [[Shock Rifle]]\
      \ ammo.\n* 5x [[Sniper Rifle]] ammo.\n* 5x [[Rocket Launcher]] ammo.\n* 16x\
      \ [[Weapon Locker]]\n** 6x [[Rocket Launcher]], [[Shock Rifle]], [[Link Gun]],\
      \ [[Minigun]], [[Grenade Launcher]], [[Sniper Rifle]].\n** 4x [[Rocket Launcher]],\
      \ [[Shock Rifle]], [[Link Gun]], [[Minigun]], [[Sniper Rifle]].\n** 2x [[Rocket\
      \ Launcher]], [[Shock Rifle]], [[Link Gun]], [[Flak Cannon]], [[Sniper Rifle]].\n\
      ** 2x [[Rocket Launcher]], [[Shock Rifle]], [[Link Gun]], [[Minigun]].\n** 2x\
      \ [[Rocket Launcher]], [[Link Gun]], [[Minigun]], [[Sniper Rifle]].\n\n=== Pickups\
      \ ===\n* 5x Super Shield.\n* 2x UDamage.\n\n=== Vehicles and turrets ===\n*\
      \ 8x Link Turrets\n* 5x Minigun Turrets\n* 5x Floor Sentinels\n* 5x Ceiling\
      \ Sentinels\n* 6x Turrets\n\n== Tips & tricks ==\nQuite often in this scenario\
      \ the defensive team is respawned in a hideout near the objective. This means\
      \ that the teams are placed at both ends of a route/field, while occasionally\
      \ valuable pickups are placed somewhere in the middle. The UDamage in the 2nd\
      \ objective, Super Shield Pack for the second-last objective and the Shield\
      \ Pack on the route to the Reactor Room are good examples. These pickups will\
      \ give the holder (and thus his/her entire team) a significant advantage in\
      \ battle. A good knowledge of the location of these pickups can be crucial in\
      \ this scenario.\n\n==Trivia==\n* AS-Acatana was the 5th place winner in the\
      \ \"Best Assault Level\" category in Phase IV of the Make Something Unreal Contest\n\
