      \ destroy you. If he beats you to the Shields (especially the Super Shield)\
      \ at least 3 times, you're dead. Needless to say, it would be a good idea to\
      \ play some small Instant Action matches in the map before facing Xan.</li>\n\
      <li> If you find that Xan took the Super Shield before you, then camp outside\

      \ <a href=\"/Adrenaline\" title=\"Adrenaline\">Adrenaline</a> Combo.</li>\n\
      <li> If you're really lucky, and Xan decides to go to the Super Shield from\

    text: "{{spoilers}}\n\nThe Unreal Tournament 2004 Finals are the 2 hardest levels\
      \ in the [[UT2004 Single Player]] ladder.\n\n== Finals overview ==\n{| class=\"\
      wikitable\"\n|-\n! Map !! Prize !! Gametype !! Scorelimit !! Timelimit\n|-\n\
      | [[DM-Deck17]] || 5000 || Team Deathmatch || 35 || 20\n|-\n| [[DM-HyperBlast2]]\
      \ || 10000 || Deathmatch || 20 || 20\n|}\n\nThere are 3 possible bosses that\
      \ you can face, the leaders of the Godlike Tier:\n\n* [[Thunder Crash]], with\
      \ [[Malcolm]] as final opponent.\n* [[The Corrupt]], with [[Xan]] as final opponent.\n\
      * [[Iron Skull]], with [[ClanLord]] as final opponent.\n\nWhich one you'll fight\
      \ depends on how well these teams fared in the Ladders. You can follow this\
      \ by going to the '''Details''' button, and then to the '''Opposing Teams'''\
      \ tab at the top.\n\n== The teams ==\n=== Iron Skull ===\n{{QuoteSource|The\
      \ Skaarj disposed of all other competitors on their way to this year's finals.\
      \ In reaction to their surprising defeat in the ladder at your hands, they have\
      \ brought in their Clan Lord to reinforce the team. The Clan Lord is like no\
      \ Skaarj you have ever faced.|Pre-Finals speech|Unreal Tournament 2004}}\n\n\
      : ''Main article: [[Iron Skull#Unreal Tournament 2004|Iron Skull]]''\n\n====\
      \ Team overview ====\nThis team is focused on attacking you, so it's easy to\
      \ get overwhelmed by their berserk rage, and getting the flag/ball in [[CTF]]/[[BR]]\
      \ respectively. But this is also it's Achilles' Heel. If you play smart with\
      \ strategies you can dominate them.\n\n==== ClanLord ====\nClanLord is the meanest,\
      \ greenest, and most aggressive of both the team and the three Godlike leaders.\
      \ His fighting style is offensively oriented: he will attack you pretty much\
      \ every time he sees you, and the first thing he cares about is fragging you,\
      \ to the point of being willing to attack even with the Assault Rifle. He can\
      \ be extremely annoying since he never gives up the chase for his prey. But,\
      \ like his team, you can use it as your advantage as well.\n\n==== Final match\
      \ strategies and hints ====\n* Your best bet is to go outside of the ship and\
      \ blast him to outer space, because he constantly jumps and dodge towards you,\
      \ where he can flak you.\n* Another area of interest may be the Shield Pack\
      \ area, where the space is so tight, he can be easily shock-combo'd. If he somehow\
      \ survives it, then he'll probably be knocked off the ship, and if he isn't,\
      \ finish him off by shoting a flak grenade at him.\n\n===The Corrupt===\n{{QuoteSource|The\
      \ Corrupt have done the bidding of their master, Xan Kriegor, and advanced to\
      \ the Tournament finals. Now Xan enters the fray, and your previous success\
      \ against The Corrupt is rendered meaningless.|Pre-Finals speech|Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2004}}\n\n: ''Main article: [[The Corrupt#Unreal Tournament 2004|The Corrupt]]''\n\
      \n==== Team overview ====\nThe Corrupt is always hard. This team is an excellent\
      \ demonstration of shock combo whores and annoying dodgers. In fact, they take\
      \ it to a whole new level. Like Xan, they're all afraid of dying so they'll\
      \ often take shields and try to max their health. Don't go with just a fully\
      \ loaded flak cannon and 100 health against them, you'll be annihilated. Give\
      \ them a taste of their own medicine and stock up on health yourself. In [[CTF]]\
      \ and [[Bombing Run]], use your [[Translocator]] as a security camera, and telefrag\
      \ them.\n\n==== Xan Kriegor ====\nXan fights defensively. The first thing he\
      \ cares about is weapon, shield, and health, and then, in fragging you, when\
      \ he has more shield and health than you. He'll run from you if he doesn't have\
      \ enough health, or has a bad weapon, to the point that you'll find yourself\
      \ usually hunting HIM down instead of HIM hunting YOU down.\n\n==== Final match\
      \ strategies and hints ====\n* The basic thing is to learn the map and time\
      \ both Shields, so you can always get the shields before him. If you don't know\
      \ the map or how long the Shields take to spawn, he'll destroy you. If he beats\
      \ you to the Shields (especially the Super Shield) at least 3 times, you're\
      \ dead. Needless to say, it would be a good idea to play some small Instant\
      \ Action matches in the map before facing Xan.\n* If you find that Xan took\
      \ the Super Shield before you, then camp outside the ship and don't let him\
      \ take the small shield.\n* The best weapon against Xan is the [[Minigun]],\
      \ since he constantly jumps around. Make sure your minigun has plenty of ammo.\n\
      * If you want to do a turnback, collect a lot of Adrenaline and use the Booster\
      \ [[Adrenaline]] Combo.\n* If you're really lucky, and Xan decides to go to\
      \ the Super Shield from the lower ship, (where the [[Bio Rifle]] and [[Flak\
      \ Cannon]] are) use the [[Shock Rifle]] (you should have got one and plenty\
      \ of Shock Cores while you were camping outside the ship) to kick him overboard.\
      \ 3 or 5 shots should knock him off. Xan can then say goodbye to his armor.\n\
      \n===Thunder Crash===\n{{QuoteSource|Malcolm is back, and his return transforms\
      \ Thunder Crash. They defeated all the other contestants without their great\
      \ champion. His return would seem to make their ultimate victory certain.|Pre-Finals\
      \ speech|Unreal Tournament 2004}}\n\n: ''Main article: [[Thunder Crash#Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2004|Thunder Crash]]''\n\n==== Team overview ====\nSurprisingly,\
      \ Malcolm's team isn't that hard at all. They decided to go all balanced with\
      \ their skills, but their tactics are awesome, so, if you think [[The Corrupt]]\
      \ are cool and try to copy their moves, don't play with them when fighting against\
      \ this team; instead, try Iron Skull Skaarj if you're into that. Speaking of\
      \ which, the same tactics that team uses and their aggressive berserk rage tactics\
      \ work excellent against this team, and it's very easy to copy Iron Skull's\
      \ tactics. Because of this, many people think Thunder Crash is the weakest Godlike\
      \ team...\n\n==== Malcolm ====\n...but this doesn't count for Malcolm. He's\
      \ the one you gotta watch out for. As long as he doesn't get in your way, you're\
      \ good to go. His fighting style is all-round. He isn't too aggressive or too\
      \ defensive; he's the most balanced of them all; in fact, he's half the way\
      \ between ClanLord's berserk rage aggressiveness and Xan's max-health/max-armor\
      \ attitude. Many people say that Malcolm is the hardest boss, this is because,\
      \ unlike Xan, Malcolm isn't jumpy, but he dodges a lot, making splash weapons\
      \ useless, and he's a Flak Monkey. Sometimes, depending on if his winning or\
      \ losing, he will change his combat style.\n\n==== Final match strategies and\
      \ hints ====\n* Like the rest of the bosses, don't let him get the Shields,\
      \ and the Minigun works well on him, so lure him outside the ship, and whip\
      \ him out with the Minigun.\n* Use the Shock Rifle and, if you got the skills,\
      \ combo him.\n* You should be able to change your fighting styles as well. You\
      \ can control him in this case. Remember. Defensive beats Offensive, All-Round\
      \ beats Defensive, and Offensive beats All-Round.\n\n== The matches ==\n===\
