      <blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">Your <a href=\"/Marine\" title=\"\

      \ Their ship crashed in a forest on the far side of the planet. They've still\
      \ got the artifact. They've set up a perimeter and will hold position until\
      \ you arrive. The indigenous creatures shouldn't give you any trouble, but somebody\
      \ shot that ship down - and whoever did is probably still around.<br />\nWe\
      \ can't fly you in there. You'll have to go in on foot.  They've lit beacons\
      \ to guide you to the crash site. Go get the Marines and lead them to a clearing\
      \ big enough to set the Atlantis down. I'll see you soon.</blockquote><div style=\"\
      text-align: right; font-size: 88%; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 1em;\"\
      ><a href=\"/Aida\" title=\"Aida\">Aida</a></div>\n<p>You will be shown the crashed\
      \ <a href=\"/Marine\" title=\"Marine\">Marines</a>' dropship, a process of placing\
      \ <a href=\"/Field_Generator\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Field Generator\"\
      >Field Generators</a>, then a <a href=\"/Rammer\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Rammer\">Rammer</a> and the beacons. You start the level near PeaceKeeper. A\
      \ few points to remember before you go on: as Aida said, the creatures here\
      \ are not aggressive. But watch your fire, or they will get mad and try to attack\
      \ you. You shouldn't act as in a \"shoot everything that moves\" game here.\
      \ Another point to remember is that there are absolutely no enemies here before\
      \ you reach the Marines. So take your time and explore instead of just following\
      \ the beacons. Don't worry, you won't get lost, those beacons are everywhere.\
      \ The third point to remember is that unlike in other <a href=\"/Unreal_series\"\
      \ title=\"Unreal series\">Unreal series</a> games, you don't cause stomp damage\
      \ - that is, you can jump on the animals as much as you want and you won't get\
      \ them angry.\n</p><p>That's why this level is the most peaceful level of all\
      \ the ones that you will find in this game. You can just relax by walking on\
      \ the terrain, looking at the animals, their incredibly detailed shadows, the\
      \ trees, the weather effects and so on.\n</p><p>After you're bored of exploring,\
      \ go find the spot where you can see a Shield Charger. Remember that place and\
      \ the closest path from there to the Marines. After you're used to that, go\
      \ over and see Sgt. Kramer. He will disable the Force Wall and let you pass.\
      \ Now a quite complex dialogue starts. It doesn't matter in what order you'll\
      \ talk, but the dialogue here is given in the most fluent order:\n</p>\n<div\

      \ the Marines now run out of the wreckage. Their target is that Energy Station\
      \ you saw earlier. So move on as you did before - straight towards the Station.\
      \ There's an interesting fact about these Marines: they are absolutely invincible.\
      \ None of them will die in this scenario, regardless of how much damage he will\
      \ take. Another interesting fact is that those Marines act a lot like bots in\
      \ Unreal Tournament series - they can taunt, follow paths, get your back, inform\
      \ about incoming enemies, complain for shooting them etc. So to survive, you\
      \ should just hide behind the Marines and let them do all the work as they're\
      \ invincible.\n</p><p>Once you get to the clearing the Marines will start building\
      \ a perimeter: both entryways to the clearing will be blocked by their <a href=\"\
      /Force_Wall\" title=\"Force Wall\">Force Walls</a>, and additionally an <a href=\"\
      /Auto_Turret\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Auto Turret\">Auto Turret</a> will\
      \ be set up to help you defend from the left (when looking from the Power Station).\
      \ So that's why the main foes will come from the right side. Soon enough you\
      \ will see more <a href=\"/Izarians\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Izarians\"\

      \ Follow Kramer and make sure the fire is received only by Kramer, and not yourself.\

      \ no matter how much friendly fire he takes. If you can, let Kramer deal with\
      \ enemies, and hold his back. You have to keep yourself alive for five minutes,\
      \ and Aida will keep informing you about the time you have left.\n</p>\n<div\

      \ Turret (pictured). Then, continue going forward and climbing up until you\

      \ mountain, and you will slowly get closer and closer to the top. Once you're\

      \ is the second mission on [[Elara V]] in [[Unreal II]]. Unlike the most other\
      \ levels, this one is mainly an enemy avoiding practise. It is famous for the\
      \ creatures living there, [[Seagoat]]s, that are the main easter egg topic in\
      \ the whole game. It doesn't have the usual Atlantis Interlude level.\n\n==Marsh\
      \ - Sanctuary Lost==\n\n===First cutscene===\n\n[[Image:Swamp0.jpg|right|thumb|250px|TCA\
      \ Atlantis and PeaceKeeper]]\n\nYour dropship flies back to [[TCA Atlantis]]\
      \ from Elara V. When it is about to land in it, [[Aida]] calls [[John Dalton]].\
      \ A dialogue starts.\n{{Quote|Aida: Atlantis calling PeaceKeeper.  We're sending\
      \ you back, John.<br />\nDalton: What's up, Aida?<br />\nAida: We've got more\
      \ trouble down there.|[[Aida]] and [[John Dalton]]}}\nPeaceKeeper turns back\
      \ and lands on the surface of Sanctuary. Obviously Aida heard the news only\
      \ when PeaceKeeper was about to land, as otherwise she would have contacted\
      \ John earlier, and the ship wouldn't have flown anywhere, as Ne'Ban controls\
      \ it. The cutscene ends here.\n\n===Marsh - Sanctuary Lost===\n[[Image:Swamp2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A\
      \ [[Rammer]] shown in the cutscene]]\n\nAn introduction now replaces the briefing.\
      \ Aida explains why you're here:\n{{QuoteSource|Your [[Marine]] pals were shot\
      \ down before they reached escape velocity. Their ship crashed in a forest on\
      \ the far side of the planet. They've still got the artifact. They've set up\
      \ a perimeter and will hold position until you arrive. The indigenous creatures\
      \ shouldn't give you any trouble, but somebody shot that ship down - and whoever\
      \ did is probably still around.<br />\nWe can't fly you in there. You'll have\
      \ to go in on foot.  They've lit beacons to guide you to the crash site. Go\
      \ get the Marines and lead them to a clearing big enough to set the Atlantis\
      \ down. I'll see you soon.|Aida|Aida}}\n\nYou will be shown the crashed [[Marine]]s'\
      \ dropship, a process of placing [[Field Generator]]s, then a [[Rammer]] and\
      \ the beacons. You start the level near PeaceKeeper. A few points to remember\
      \ before you go on: as Aida said, the creatures here are not aggressive. But\
      \ watch your fire, or they will get mad and try to attack you. You shouldn't\
      \ act as in a \"shoot everything that moves\" game here. Another point to remember\
      \ is that there are absolutely no enemies here before you reach the Marines.\
      \ So take your time and explore instead of just following the beacons. Don't\
      \ worry, you won't get lost, those beacons are everywhere. The third point to\
      \ remember is that unlike in other [[Unreal series]] games, you don't cause\
      \ stomp damage - that is, you can jump on the animals as much as you want and\
      \ you won't get them angry.\n\nThat's why this level is the most peaceful level\
      \ of all the ones that you will find in this game. You can just relax by walking\
      \ on the terrain, looking at the animals, their incredibly detailed shadows,\
      \ the trees, the weather effects and so on.\n\nAfter you're bored of exploring,\
      \ go find the spot where you can see a Shield Charger. Remember that place and\
      \ the closest path from there to the Marines. After you're used to that, go\
      \ over and see Sgt. Kramer. He will disable the Force Wall and let you pass.\
      \ Now a quite complex dialogue starts. It doesn't matter in what order you'll\
      \ talk, but the dialogue here is given in the most fluent order:\n\n[[Image:Swamp3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The\
      \ dialogue and the goody crate]]\n\n{{Quote|Kramer: Glad you could drop by,\
      \ Marshal.<br />\nDalton: I was in the neighborhood.<br />\nKramer: Such a nice\
      \ night for a walk, too.<br />\nDalton: Who was it? [[Izarians]]?<br />\nKramer:\
      \ [[Skaarj]], more likely.<br />\nDalton: Did you get the artifact?<br />\n\
      Kramer: Dug it out of the wreckage. Not a scratch on it.<br />\nDalton: Any\
      \ enemy activity?<br />\nKramer: Just some Izarian scouts. 'Course now they\
      \ know we're here.<br />\nDalton: Did everyone make it?<br />\nKramer: All three\
      \ of us. Ready for action.<br />\nDalton: We need to scout out a clearing.<br\
      \ />\nKramer: Way ahead of you. There's a spot about 2 clicks away. Perfect\
      \ for a dropship.<br />\nDalton: There's not gonna be a dropship.<br />\nKramer:\
      \ What?!?<br />\nDalton: Goin' deaf on me, soldier?<br />\nKramer: No, sir.\
      \ Sorry, sir.<br />\nDalton: We're bringing the [[TCA Atlantis|Atlantis]] down.<br\
      \ />\nKramer: Holy sh... Can you do that?<br />\nDalton: Piece of cake.<br />\n\
      Kramer: All right Marines, look sharp - we're moving out. Stay close Marshal.\
      \ If we get separated, I'll come find you.|[[John Dalton]] and [[Kramer]]}}\n\
      \nWhile talking, collect all the goodies in the area: [[Combat Assault Rifle]],\
      \ Assault Rifle clip, [[Shotgun]], 8 shotgun shells, 2 [[Health]] Pickups and\
      \ 3 Energy Pickups.\n\nThe dialogue reveals some interesting information: even\
      \ though you're only in [[TCA]], even Marines listen to you.\n\n[[Image:Swamp4.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Izarian\
      \ ambush]]\n\nAnyway, the Marines now run out of the wreckage. Their target\
      \ is that Energy Station you saw earlier. So move on as you did before - straight\
      \ towards the Station. There's an interesting fact about these Marines: they\
      \ are absolutely invincible. None of them will die in this scenario, regardless\
      \ of how much damage he will take. Another interesting fact is that those Marines\
      \ act a lot like bots in Unreal Tournament series - they can taunt, follow paths,\
      \ get your back, inform about incoming enemies, complain for shooting them etc.\
      \ So to survive, you should just hide behind the Marines and let them do all\
      \ the work as they're invincible.\n\nOnce you get to the clearing the Marines\
      \ will start building a perimeter: both entryways to the clearing will be blocked\
      \ by their [[Force Wall]]s, and additionally an [[Auto Turret]] will be set\
      \ up to help you defend from the left (when looking from the Power Station).\
      \ So that's why the main foes will come from the right side. Soon enough you\
      \ will see more [[Izarians]] and even light [[Skaarj]]. Follow Kramer and make\
      \ sure the fire is received only by Kramer, and not yourself. Dodge when needed,\
      \ and don't worry, Kramer won't turn aggressive towards you no matter how much\
      \ friendly fire he takes. If you can, let Kramer deal with enemies, and hold\
      \ his back. You have to keep yourself alive for five minutes, and Aida will\
      \ keep informing you about the time you have left.\n\n[[Image:Swamp5.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The\
      \ rock you need to climb in order to get to the safe point]]\n\nHowever, there\
      \ is a trick that lets you avoid all the enemies you could possibly encounter\
      \ in this map. Once the perimeter is set, climb onto the rock where the Auto\
      \ Turret is. Once you're there, climb another one so you would stand somewhat\
      \ higher than the Auto Turret (pictured). Then, continue going forward and climbing\
      \ up until you see a large mountain that you can't climb. Go counter clockwise\
      \ around that mountain, and you will slowly get closer and closer to the top.\
      \ Once you're on top of the mountain, you're safe, as your enemies don't know\
      \ the path to this place.\n\nSoon the level will end and the cutscene will start.\n\
      \n==Second cutscene==\n\n[[Image:Swamp6.jpg|right|thumb|250px|TCA Atlantis landing]]\n\
      \nThe hill near your beacon will be shown, as well as a [[Skaarj]] with an [[Izarian]]\
      \ on top of it. The Skaarj groans, and all of a sudden TCA Atlantis appears\
      \ from the sky. It flies down and crushes the opponents. Aida will exclaim:\n\
      {{QuoteSource|Someone called for a taxi?<br />\nMore on the way.  Let's get\
      \ outta here.<br />\nMove it!  Let's go!|Aida|Aida}}\n\nAll the four of you\
      \ stand still for a moment before entering Atlantis. The camera turns, revealing\
      \ a Seagoat that successfully attempts to get into your ship. As Aida asked\
      \ to hurry up, the entering creature was unseen until later, and you receive\
      \ your first [[Artifacts|Artifact]].\n\n==Trivia==\nThe Dialog Editor reveals\
      \ that in the second cutscene Aida was supposed to exclaim phrases randomly,\
      \ but that was never implemented. The phrases that were unused are:\n{{QuoteSource|I'm\
      \ comin' in.<br />\nNeed a ride, fellas?<br />\nStill plenty of 'em out there.\
      \ Let's go.<br />\nClimb aboard.<br />\nLet's go!<br />\nMore on the way.  Let's\
      \ go!|Aida|Aida}}\n\n{{prevnext|Sanctuary|Hell}}\n{{Unreal 2: The Awakening\
