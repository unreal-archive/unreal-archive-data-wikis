      \ Izanagi is a broad-based conglomerate modeled on the ancient Japanese Kereitsu.\
      \ They're into whatever makes money, and they protect themselves with an elite\
      \ corps of Merc soldiers, fanatically loyal to the corporation, who call themselves\
      \ \"Ghost Warriors\".|John Dalton|John Dalton}}\n\nThe '''Izanagi Corporation''',\
      \ along with the [[Axon Research Corporation]], seem to be the newest major\
      \ corporation in the Unreal universe. While [[Liandri Mining Corporation|Liandri]]\
      \ and [[Phayder Corporation|Phayder]] are established in [[UT]], their two main\
      \ competitors were only introduced in [[Unreal II]]. Since their introduction,\
      \ they have seen increasing use; however, Axon seems to be given preferential\
      \ treatment over Izanagi, perhaps due to the simplicity of its name.\n\nThe\
      \ Izanagi are one of the main antagonists of Unreal II, the other being Liandri\
      \ (as the player works for [[Terran Colonial Authority]], an offsout of [[NEG]]).\
      \ Izanagi [[Ghost Warrior]]s are by far the most common enemy encountered in\
      \ the game.\n\nIn [[UT3]] The Izanagi employ the [[Ronin]] team, including the\
      \ main character [[Reaper]].\n\n==Military units==\n===Ghost Warriors===\n{{QuoteSource|Well\
      \ trained. Some live by the old Samurai code. Others are just in it for the\
      \ action.|Isaak of Unreal II|Isaak}}\n{{QuoteSource|\"Ghost Warriors\" is the\
      \ name of the fighting elite of the original Izanagi clan.|Aida in Unreal II|Unreal\
      \ II}}\nThe [[Ghost Warrior]]s are a mercenary group completely loyal to the\
      \ Izanagi Corporation and, while billed as mercs, are not known to have taken\
      \ any assignments from any other entity. The name \"Ghost Warriors\" was originally\
      \ the name of the elite fighters of the Izanagi clan, before its days as a corporation,\
      \ but it is unknown if they remained pure blooded or later took recruits.\n\n\
      By the time of UT2004, the Ghost Warriors are either gone or simply remain absent\
      \ from Liandri's Tournament, though scenarios sparked by their aggressive involvement\
      \ are re-enacted.\n\n===Ronin===\nThe [[Ronin]] are a team of Izanagi Ghost\
      \ Warriors. The members of the team joined the Izanagi corporation forces to\
      \ avenge the [[Necris]] for the Twin Souls masacre. Ronin members are the main\
      \ characters in the [[Unreal Tournament 3]] campaign.\n\n==Involvement==\n===Unreal\
      \ II===\nIn Unreal II, the Izanagi are after the [[Artifacts]], competing directly\
      \ against [[Liandri]] and [[NEG]]. Indeed, Izanagi held several artifacts in\
      \ its possession, including two at a point of near extraction with heavy defenses\
      \ at the mining sites. \n\n====Acheron====\nThe Izanagi discovered the third\
      \ artifact on [[Acheron]]. They had built a localized mining facility near its\
      \ location, complete with paved roads and the beginnings of a terraforming project\
      \ on the world. A large number of Ghost Warriors defended the site. The artifact's\
      \ location was known and explosives were mounted and ready for its extraction,\
      \ but it is unknown why they had not already removed it. The artifact and perhaps\
      \ the entire facility was lost when [[John Dalton]] took the artifact, which\
      \ caused the planet to attack other living beings inside and on its surface.\n\
      \n====Severnaya====\nThe Izanagi controlled the [[Minkovsky Dam]] on the surface\
      \ of [[Severnaya]]. The dam was the target of an [[NEG]] Marine sabotage mission,\
      \ however, the marines were routed after placing the charges and were not able\
      \ to arm or detonate them. Dalton proceeded to enter the facility, arm the bombs,\
      \ and destroyed the dam along with dozens of Ghost Warriors.\n\n====Sulferon====\n\
      A secret research facility was on [[Sulferon]]. John Dalton infiltrated and\
      \ routed the base, clearing the way for a marine-escorted technician to steal\
      \ information on the detection of artifacts while the Ghost Warriors attempted\
      \ unsuccessfully to re-take the base.\n\n====Janus====\nAfter the Izanagi Corporation\
      \ learned that the Axon [[Polaris]] research facility on [[Janus]] housed two\
      \ artifacts, they made a successful assault and occupation of the facility.\
      \ However, they were unable to acquire the artifacts before Dalton arrived and\
      \ eradicated the Warriors.\n\n====Na Koja Abad====\nAn alien building was discovered\
      \ on [[Na Koja Abad]] and the Izanagi built a facility around it. Housed deep\
      \ inside the building was the sixth artifact. Exactly like on Acheron before,\
      \ the Izanagi were close to acquiring the artifact, but John Dalton came and\
      \ defeated them while stealing the artifact himself.\n\n===UT2004===\nIzanagi\
      \ does not take a primary role in UT2004; instead, it is only referenced in\
      \ a few minor descriptions. Its most major appearance in UT2004 is [[AS-Glacier]].\n\
      \n====Picard====\nPicard is an Tournament participant who stole secret space\
      \ fighter designs from the Izanagi Corporation. He is immune to their pursuit\
      \ while in the Tournament, though he is never seen.\n\n====Team SuperNova====\n\
      For unknown reasons, [[SuperNova]] is indebted to the Izanagi Corporation. The\
      \ mercenary outfit joined Liandri's Tournament hoping for a means to pay off\
      \ their debt.\n\n====AS-BP2-JumpShip====\nDuring the [[Corporation Wars]], Izanagi\
      \ Ghost Warriors stole a prototype faster-than-light ship from Liandri and successfully\
      \ jumped it to Izanagi space. The event was later re-enacted in Liandri's Tournament.\n\
      \ \n====AS-Glacier====\nAxon agents infiltrated and destroyed the Izanagi base\
      \ on Lamdon 3, stealing the prototype [[Ion Plasma Tank]] in the process. Curiously,\
      \ the Izanagi base was defended by [[New Earth Government|NEG]]-backed [[Thunder\
      \ Crash]] forces; in Unreal II, Axon backed the NEG and both openly fought Izanagi.\
      \ It is not known why the Ghost Warriors were not at the base.\n\n===Unreal\
      \ Tournament 3===\nThe Japanese-themed [[Ronin]] team is said to be Izanagi-backed\
      \ in UT3.\n\n[[Category:Corporations| {{PAGENAME}}]]"
