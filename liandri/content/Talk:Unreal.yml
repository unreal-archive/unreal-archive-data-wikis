      \ BU links directly here from the Classic Unreal Titles section on BU site,\
      \ instead of the essential files. So I think we should add some links to the\
      \ wizards here or something more, people are still willing to find things they\

      \ 08:57, 13 September 2008 (EDT)\n\nNope. DK stands for Darkmatch, which is\
      \ like deathmatch, but without any light in the arena. DKNightOp is the only\
      \ map for this gametype. -[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]] 10:30, 13 September 2008\

      \ 13 September 2008 (EDT)\n\nWhile we're on the topic, what should we use as\
      \ the map's page? The filename is DKNightOp, but this page lists it as DkNightOp.\
      \ There are a few other cases, such as DMfith being listed as DmFith. Should\
      \ we keep the links as they are (for formatting reasons) but change their destinations\
      \ to the official filenames of the maps? --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]] 08:39,\
      \ 14 September 2008 (EDT)\n\n{{keep}}. It looks unified. And just add redirect\
      \ links there. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 09:37, 15 September 2008\
      \ (EDT)\n\n== Bonus content ==\n\nFusion Map Pack is not the only official bonus\
      \ content for Unreal, there are others packs done by Epic, like the 3DFX pack\
      \ containing DMKrazy, DMBayC, DMCreek (included in the unreal special demo included\
      \ in some audio card drivers by creative, together with a creative bonus pack,\
      \ having maps not by Epic directly though, but still can be counted as official)\
      \ and then GW press addon pack DMScruular, Villa2, Locke.\nThe maps I named\
      \ were done by Epic.\n\nThe download for 3DFX conbined with GW press can be\
      \ found here (includes a fixed villa2 by me, so it can be played in later versions):\

      \n:Yes, but these maps were never officially released (publicly). You couldn't\
      \ get them in an official bonus pack or anything. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]]\
      \ 19:18, 1 January 2009 (EST)\n\n::Well but the maps are official ones, I mean\
      \ these first three were included in OEM demo found on the Unreal Special CD\
      \ which came with some creative labs sound cards (that's how I got them), they\
      \ should be at least listed as demo maps or someting and as gw press addon ones\
      \ as a bonus for purchasing GW press strategy guide and you had to answer question\
      \ how long was the soundtrack to originally get them. I mean Unreal is the only\
      \ incomplete game in  here with not all of the maps being listed. I mean there\
      \ are even listed console exclusive maps for each game, only game with missing\
      \ stuff is Unreal. --[[User:Leo(T.C.K.)|Leo(T.C.K.)]] 21:26, 9 January 2009\
      \ (EST)\n\n:I think it deserves a mention, but nothing more than that. Essential\
      \ files, and map pages especially, should be limited to stock maps or bonus\
      \ maps released by Epic themselves. If we start including semi-official content\
      \ we'll have to include the CBP's as well, which would add another 100 pages\
      \ to the to-do list.  Additional Information#Trivia seems like a good place\
      \ for a mention, seeing how it also lists a few SP maps cut from the game. --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]]\
      \ 21:26, 17 January 2009 (EST)\n\n::I think we have already agreed that semi-official\
      \ content is OK as long as it's listed on a single page. So create a page for\
      \ all 3DFX and GW maps combined and link all of the maps there. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 13:43, 18 January 2009 (EST)\n\n:::I have to disagree, the GW press and these\
      \ OEM demo( this is official so it should be listed and the GW maps were as\
      \ bonus for the strategy guide and were released by Epic as well) maps were\
      \ made by Epic themselves, it's not like it did another team, the authors of\
      \ these maps are Cliff, Myshathesleddog and Allan Willard. I really think it\
      \ should be counted as official, beacuse it simply is official, only it was\
      \ not included in a pack like it was later, the 3dfx pack consisted of the 3\
      \ OEM demo maps, but it was not distributed as 3dfx, that is why I edited the\
      \ page so these appear there. And as CBPs go, one of the CPB, the UT2003 one,\
      \ was listed even in official ut2003 site first and still is. --[[User:Leo(T.C.K.)|Leo(T.C.K.)]]\
      \ 15:44, 18 January 2009 (EST)\n\n::::Contributions by Epic/DE employees to\
      \ non-Epic/DE projects don't count as official content and don't get map-specific\
      \ pages. Don't forget that a few employees regularly contributed to community\
      \ projects (such as the CBP's, Rocket Arena, Jailbreak and many more) as well\
      \ as personal projects, which will lead to too long a list to complete. 3rd-party\
      \ projects that are in some way involved with Epic (either by Epic contributing\
      \ content, or distributing the project) should be treated as semi-official content.\
      \ In the case of these extras, a small article, like GreatEmerald suggested,\
      \ would suffice. I'm about to finish up the article on RA maps, which, in combination\
      \ with the Rocket Arena page itself, will hopefully serve as a template for\
      \ other semi-official mod projects --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]] 16:43, 18\

      \ 16:58, 18 January 2009 (EST)\n\n:::::The CBP wasn't included in UT2004 :P\
      \ It was a community pack like any other, the difference being it was the only\
      \ major community mappack for 2003 and the involvement of CliffyB and a few\

      ::::I am sorry, but this is not contributation to non epic project, this is\

      \ it is official. There is no doubt here, yeah that division pack or 3dfx is\
      \ not official, as that is only merged content, but hell, these maps were released\
      \ within Unreal Special edition demo....this is nothing like RocketArena, I\
      \ mean on this only worked Epic members and it was released by them in the demo\
      \ itself, there should be no discussion like this, I mean if there are listed\
      \ at Liandri Archives console maps, then teher should be listed this, I mean\
      \ god i've got these on friggin Unreal Special edition CD and it was made by\
      \ epic....OEM demo maps should be there by any means, I mean that Epic didn't\

      \ maps--[[User:Leo(T.C.K.)|Leo(T.C.K.)]] 21:03, 18 January 2009 (EST)\n\n:::::Ah,\
      \ I'm sorry for misunderstanding the nature of these projects then. It doesn't\
      \ change much though. We can discuss whether or not it's truly official, but\
      \ we've agreed here that we only count out-of-the-box content and content released\
      \ directly by the creators of the game (ie made available for download by themselves)\
      \ as the game's official content. To save time and effort, we've agreed that\
      \ other projects that we feel should be added, should be added in a more compact\
      \ form. What I mean is that in this case, 1 page for the 3DFX pack and 1 for\
      \ the OEM maps with a short description on the pack itself and the maps would\
      \ suffice. It's just too much work to make map pages for every individual map\
      \ that we feel should be added. --[[User:Kaithofis|Kaithofis]] 07:34, 19 January\

      \ (EST)\n::::::Well, the 3DFX pack=OEM Demo maps, they were only later released\
      \ separately in that \"3dfx\" pack and the GW Maps(if you played ut classic\
      \ pack3 you alrady know them if you have read the readme, that is Scruular Villa2\

      \ download for people who own the official strategy guide and know the length\
      \ of the soundtrack, then they could download the maps, sadly the support went\
      \ offline some days later. Also Villa2 is called Villa2, because there was Villa\
      \ in pre release versions of Unreal, this Villa2 is bigger map than that (new\
      \ rooms) and have different inventory placement and some changes. Oh and btw,\
      \ why does have Unreal2 listed as bonus content http://liandri.beyondunreal.com/Unreal_2#Bonus_Content\
      \ that solaris map....it was released just on its own and is even les bonus\

      \ guide as bonus for download), but the maps should stay there in the list of\
