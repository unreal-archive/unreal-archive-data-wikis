      \ return it to one's own flag.  A flag cannot be returned if one's own flag\
      \ is stolen.  If the flag carrier dies or translocates, the flag is dropped.\
      \  Dropped flags can be picked up by the team of the opposite color, and they\

      <p>Capture the flag maps tend to be highly symmetrical.  This is to achieve\
      \ a perfect balance between both teams, because asymmetrical layouts often lend\
      \ a certain bonus to one team or another.  In addition, there are almost always\
      \ multiple entrances to the flag area and they're often from different directions.\
      \  CTF tends to have at least 2-4 lower routes between flags, 1-3 upper routes,\
      \ a large central area with a valuable pickup, and enough room to maneuver easily\
      \ around the flag.  Most CTF maps are linear (so that the bases are laid out\
      \ across from each other--the very best example is the (in)famous CTF-Face)\
      \ and as a result the z-axis component and the degree to which paths overlap\
      \ is extremely important.  Both effect how easy it is for defenders to catch\
      \ up to the flag carrier, as well as how easy it is for attackers to invade.\n\
      </p><p>Capture the Flag maps range from the very rare <a href=\"/1v1\" title=\"\
      1v1\">1v1</a> (<a href=\"/CTF-1on1-Joust\" title=\"CTF-1on1-Joust\">CTF-1on1-Joust</a>)\
      \ all the way up to 32 players.  The average is around 6-16 players.  Depending\
      \ on the size of the CTF map, there will often be at least two 50 armors and\
      \ one 100 armor pickup, and finding a UDamage or a Big Keg-O'-Health is not\
      \ uncommon.  However, these items (except the 50 armors) are often difficult\
      \ to reach or far out of the way to provide the necessary trade-off for reaching\
      \ them.\n</p><p>Capture the Flag uses all standard \"<a href=\"/Deathmatch\"\
      \ title=\"Deathmatch\">Deathmatch</a>\" weapons, and occasionally the grenade\
      \ launcher or mine layer are thrown in there in custom maps.  Players start\
      \ with the shield gun, assault rifle, and translocator (unless disabled).  In\
      \ addition, all pickups are supported, including adrenaline.  Often, the shock\
      \ rifle, bio gun, or flak cannon is found close to each flag.  The rocket launcher,\
      \ if it exists in a CTF map at all, can be found pretty much anywhere, often\
      \ opposite the flak cannon.  The sniper, link gun, and minigun are usually found\
      \ towards the center of the map, under the theory that they're more difficult\
      \ to obtain there, which is justified because they're the more \"<a href=\"\
      /Hitscan\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hitscan\">hitscan</a>\" weapons and\
      \ UT2004 is a hitscan-dominant game.  Health vials and adrenaline are also prevalent,\
      \ and health pickups can usually only be found near the flag (usually two of\
