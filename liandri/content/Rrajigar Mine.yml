      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Another contrast now as you move from the open areas\
      \ of <a href=\"/NyLeve%27s_Falls\" title=\"NyLeve's Falls\">NyLeve's Falls</a>\
      \ on a sunny day to within a claustrophobic mining facility. However this route\
      \ is the only one open to you, so follow it you must. Be prepared because things\
      \ are about to get really nasty.\n</p><p>Now, proceed to the end of the corridor\
      \ in which you start so that you reach the mine entrance. Make sure you have\
      \ selected the <a href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\"\
      >Automag</a>, because your first critters are just around the corner.\n</p><p>In\
      \ the first room you will see two exits. There is a <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"\
      Brute\">LesserBrute</a> patrolling the one on the left, so take him out from\
      \ a distance, remaining on the walkway on which you are standing. Then collect\
      \ the Automag and Clips from an unfortunate prisoner's corpse to the right.\
      \ Notice how the wall at the end of the walkway is in shadow; shadows are always\
      \ worth investigating in Unreal, so use your Flashlight (select it and use your\
      \ inventory use key to turn it on and off) to illuminate the area. A small tunnel\
      \ will be revealed; follow it to collect an Assault Vest at the end.\n</p><p>Returning\
      \ to the starting area, there is a mining cart which you can drop down into\
      \ to find another prisoner's corpse, a Clip and a Health Pack. Further Clips\
      \ can be found on the larger metal crates in the middle of the room, so push\
      \ the small crate up to the bigger ones and use it as a step.\n</p><p>Head now\
      \ to the door that the LesserBrute was patrolling. It is signed to the Force\
      \ Field Control Area [1].\n</p><p>Well you haven't seen the force field yet,\
      \ so let's check it out first. Take the other exit from the start area, into\
      \ a rock tunnel illuminated by blue tarydium crystals. There will be a small\
      \ quake as you enter; also watch out for the <a href=\"/Tentacle\" title=\"\
      Tentacle\">Tentacle</a> on the ceiling.\n</p><p>The next room is guarded by\
      \ a LesserBrute. Kill it, then head over to the other corner on this side of\
      \ the room where there are 3 Clips. Collect what you need then walk over to\
      \ the force field. The aforementioned force field is barring a corridor [2].\n\
      </p><p>That is not all there is to be done here though. The red barrel on a\
      \ nearby ledge contains unstable Tarydium, so shoot it and it will blow up taking\
      \ a nearby wall with it. Leap up on to the ledge (it can be done) and follow\
      \ the revealed tunnel, using your Flashlight or a Flare if required. The small\
      \ cave at the end contains a Health Pack, and corpses of a prisoner and a Nali.\
      \ The Nali's diary is nearby [3].\n</p><p>You have seen all there is to see\
      \ here; you need to deactivate the force field now so return to the start area\
      \ and head for the door to the Force Field Control Area.\n</p><p>Enter the corridor\
      \ and press the button to call the lift. Stand on the lift and it will descend\
      \ automatically; a small ledge behind you as you descend contains a Clip if\
      \ you need it. Now follow the walkway - mind the Tentacle on the way - collecting\
      \ the Clip and trying not to fall into the lava until you reach the next corridor.\
      \ Collect the Clip as you enter the corridor, then follow it. You will pass\
      \ a collection of human corpses along the way which you can ignore for now,\
      \ and upon rounding the corner after that will meet a Tentacle and wooden crates\
      \ containing a Health Pack and a very useful <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a> armour item.\n</p><p>Soon\
      \ you will come to a room with two power beams on the left and two switches\
      \ on the right, plus two consoles also identifying the power beams as the Force\
      \ Field power sources [4,5].\n</p><p>First things first, collect Clips from\
      \ behind the power beams. Then press the two switches. The power beams will\
      \ die and the music will stop, and the messages on the consoles will change\
      \ [6,7]. \n</p><p>Now set back off down the corridor. You should notice the\
      \ corpses now, because barriers will suddenly close walling you in. What happened\
      \ here to kill so many people in such a small space? You are trapped, so get\
      \ your Automag ready. Next, the lights will go out one by one from the far end\
      \ of the corridor, plunging you into darkness. Toss a couple of Flares to help\
      \ you keep your bearings. Be prepared for this - shortly after the lights are\
      \ all out, sections of wall at either end of the section of corridor will open\
      \ and, to the accompaniment of blinking red light, emergency claxons and fast\
      \ urgent music, out will come bounding your first <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScout</a>. He is fast and deadly, so dispose\
      \ of him quickly.\n</p><p>When he is dead, the barriers will be withdrawn. Collect\
      \ two Flares, a Clip and a Health Pack from the new alcoves, then head back\
      \ out to the walkway by the lava. Now return to starting area via the lift.\
      \ Be warned, two LesserBrutes will have appeared at the lift and at the start\
      \ area, so keep your Automag at the ready.\n</p><p>Proceed to the door that\
      \ was previously barred by the force field [8].\n</p><p>Enter the corridor,\
      \ collecting Tarydium Shards as you go. Follow the corridor until you reach\
      \ a lift, then ride it down. As the lift goes back up it reveals two Clips beneath\
      \ if you need them. The next corridor arrives eventually at a walkway over lava;\
      \ watch out for the Tentacles and the LesserBrute patrolling the area.\n</p><p>If\
      \ you go left at the walkway, a Tarydium barrel can be used to blow up two wooden\
      \ crates, one of which contains a box of 50 Bullets. Beware as you approach\
      \ the walkway however as part of it will collapse into the lava. Now head the\
      \ other way along the walkway, where a short corridor on the right contains\
      \ two Health Packs. Continuing along the walkway another section collapses so\
      \ watch out.\n</p><p>Tip: If you fall into the lava, follow it round underneath\
      \ the walkway. A lift will descend and you can use it to get back on to dry\
      \ ground by the two Health Packs mentioned above.\n</p><p>At the next junction\
      \ you are faced with a choice; the left path, the middle path or the right path.\
      \ You can hear a Skaarj growling on the left, so don't go there yet. A Nali\
      \ can be heard praying to the right, and you don't want to draw him to the attention\
      \ of the Skaarj as the Skaarj will probably murder him. So instead, take the\
      \ middle path and follow the corridor. Collect Clips and Tarydium Shards as\
      \ you go.\n</p><p>Now the SkaarjScout you heard growling may come and meet you\
      \ in the corridor. Most likely however he will be operating a console and you\
      \ will find that you come out behind him. Either way, dispose of him quickly\
      \ without leading him onto the Nali. The console he was operating has a message\
      \ [9].\n</p><p>Head now to the left, along the walkway over the lava again,\
      \ back in the direction of the junction. Collect the <a href=\"/VoiceBox\" title=\"\
      VoiceBox\">VoiceBox</a> inventory item as you go from behind a pillar. Now go\
      \ off to the left, where the Nali can be heard praying.\n</p><p>When you see\
      \ the Nali, don't shoot him. Never shoot the Nali, because the more you shoot\
      \ them, or let them get killed, the less helpful all the Nali will be to you\
      \ as a whole. This particular Nali beckons for you to follow him; do so, but\
      \ grab Tarydium Shards and Health Packs from the crates first. The Nali will\
      \ lead you down the middle corridor and will open a secret compartment in the\
      \ wall, where there will be further Tarydium Shards and a very useful <a href=\"\
      /Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> weapon.\n</p><p>Follow this corridor\
      \ now to its end, so that you arrive back at the Skaarj's console, and this\
      \ time make a right. A gap with lava below and a low beam blocks your way; shoot\
      \ the red plate on the wall over the lava and the beam will rise, making a handy\
      \ bridge.\n</p><p>Cross the gap, and take out the Tentacle hiding round the\
      \ corner. Collect the Clip, and select the Stinger. Enter the cave on the right,\
      \ and you will be greeted by a SkaarjScout who drops in from above. He is best\
      \ taken out with the Stinger's secondary fire mode. Mercifully now the action\
      \ music from the first fight has stopped and is no longer doing your head in.\n\
      </p><p>Having disposed of the Skaarj, shoot the tarydium barrels at the far\
      \ end to open a hole in the wall. Follow the new tunnel - collecting a Health\
      \ Pack as you go - into the next room where a LesserBrute will greet you. Now,\
      \ step up to the lever on the left and press it. Buttons will be revealed on\
      \ the central column. Press all four to open the doors around the room. Doing\
      \ so will release an angry SkaarjScout whom you should dispose of. The two corridors\
      \ revealed each lead to the same lift, and each contain two Tentacles and a\
      \ Clip. Not much to choose really, take either or both. Ride the lift up to\
      \ the corridor above, being sure to collect the Shield Belt from the alcove\
      \ at the far end of said corridor (the Belt will only be available if the Nali\
      \ has survived unscathed).\n</p><p>Enter the next area - balconies over the\
      \ room below - and grab the Stinger and Tarydium Shards. Dispose of the SkaarjScout\
      \ lurking beyond the central column. You might also take this opportunity to\
      \ kill the Tentacle that snipes from a walkway above.\n</p><p>Collect Health\
      \ Packs from crates in the alcove on the left, then follow the corridor off\
      \ to the right. More music will start as you enter the next room. Kill the Tentacle\
      \ here then shoot the Tarydium Barrels to clear your passage to the next area.\
      \ Beyond is another room where you will be met by a SkaarjScout and another\
      \ Tentacle.\n</p><p>Round the corner is another Tentacle and beyond that a mechanism\
      \ to access the upper balcony. Don't go there yet though; instead, use your\
      \ Flashlight (if your batteries are low then use a Flare) to illuminate the\
      \ shadow behind the crates to the left, and follow the revealed tunnel to get\
      \ a very useful +100 <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a>. Now return and head for the large\
      \ red control switch in the next room.\n</p><p>Remove the crate from the lift\
      \ pad as instructed [10]. Before using the lift however grab the Flare from\
      \ the corner under the balcony. Now, press the switch to summon the lift. Like\
      \ the sign said, don't stand underneath or the effect will not be as planned.\
      \ Climb aboard the lift when it has descended - the crate aboard contains a\
      \ Clip - and ride up to the balcony. Collect the Automag at the top (there's\
      \ also a clip on the metal box below the balcony).\n</p><p>Further along the\
      \ balcony you will find a LesserBrute and a Tentacle to dispose of. Collect\
      \ Tarydium Shards from the crates in the alcove, then continue down the next\
      \ walkway, taking out a further LesserBrute as you go. Follow the corridor until\
      \ you reach a Nali who will beckon to you, but don't follow him yet. Tread carefully\
      \ here; head out into the next room which contains mining carts, until you see\
      \ the SkaarjScout at the consoles. Try and kill it without it seeing the Nali.\
      \ Hopefully the Nali will have remained at the entrance, but if it has come\
      \ in it is as good as dead and there's nothing you can do to save it. If however\
      \ you are successful, then the Nali will operate the consoles to open an alcove\
      \ with a very useful Assault Vest. As you kill the Skaarj, he will drop a Health\
      \ Pack should you need it.\n</p><p>Pause now to collect Tarydium Shards from\
      \ an alcove in the other corner of the room, and to read the two consoles, one\
      \ of which warns you of unstable bridges in the lower half of the mine [11,12].\n\
      </p><p>Head down the next walkway now. A Tentacle along the way lurks above\
      \ crates containing Tarydium Shards; having disposed of that, move on and drop\
      \ down at the end to the next corridor below. To the right here are Health Packs\
      \ and a drop back to earlier in the level, beware of the SkaarjScout that drops\
      \ in behind you if you go that way. Head now the other direction and you will\
      \ reach a bridge.\n</p><p>First things first, take out the LesserBrute who shoots\
      \ from the platform on the left. Now, look at the bridge; these bridges are\
      \ unsafe as stated by the consoles, and tend to collapse. You have a choice.\
      \ You can sprint along via the Tarydium Shards behind the pillar and hope that\
      \ you don't get chucked into the lava below, or you can climb the bridge frame\
      \ which is safe, collecting the Clip at the top. This second choice has the\
      \ added advantage that you can easily make the jump to the area on the left\
      \ where there is a Shield Belt.\n</p><p>If you do get chucked in, it's only\
      \ shallow so follow the tunnel beneath where you came in (watch out as the ceiling\
      \ collapses) to the lift at the other end where there are also two boxes of\
      \ 50 Bullets and a Health Pack.\n</p><p>Now return to the main walkway after\
      \ the first bridge. Round the corner are a LesserBrute and a Nali, so once again\
      \ try to prevent the Nali from getting killed. The Nali, as long as he has survived\
      \ and you haven't shot him or any other Nali so far, will open a cave containing\
      \ a <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol_Powerup\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol Powerup\"\
      >Dispersion Pistol Powerup</a>, which significantly increases the power of your\
      \ first weapon's primary fire mode permanently.\n</p><p>Tip: You can draw the\
      \ LesserBrute's fire away from the Nali if you drop into the lava pit below\
      \ the ledge before it sees you, then jump from landmass to landmass and climb\
      \ the plank to tackle the LesserBrute.\n</p><p>Cross the second bridge - I recommend\
      \ using the frame as you can then catch the Clip on the door frame ahead - and\
      \ head down the next tunnel, dealing with the Tentacle on the ceiling. Entering\
      \ the next room beware of the SkaarjScout who jumps down from above.\n</p><p>Continue\
      \ through the next room where there is a Health Pack, and into an area with\
      \ a balcony, a lift and pillars. A SkaarjScout on the balcony will come down\
      \ the lift and attack at this point, so dispose of him, then collect Tarydium\
      \ Shards and a Health Pack from crates behind the pillars. Use the lift to access\
      \ the balcony where there is a Stinger in a crate, and a ledge where a SkaarjScout\
      \ is guarding the next walkway below. Kill the Skaarj and collect the two ASMD\
      \ Cores (ASMD ammo) from his ledge. Drop down onto the left-hand of the two\
      \ beams and follow it, where you will eventually find two Clips and be able\
      \ to drop down on to some crates to get a Shield Belt. If you require any more\
      \ Clips, then return back up the ramp behind to the room with the lift, and\
      \ this time take the right hand beam. You will eventually reach two Clips at\
      \ the other end.\n</p><p>Almost there now. Drop down onto the crossroads, where\
      \ the closed door is locked. Take instead the route which is off to the right\
      \ when you first enter this area, towards the lift. Collect what you require\
      \ of the Health Pack and Tarydium Shards here; you might also be well advised\
      \ to dispose of the tarydium barrels here, as you are about to be involved in\
      \ a firefight. Press the switch, and the lift will descend, bringing a LesserBrute\
      \ down with it. Take him out, then ride the lift yourself.\n</p><p>You will\
      \ rise to a catwalk with railings going through a room with large ventilation\
      \ fans on either side. Sprint along making sure that you don't get sucked off\
      \ by the fast fan where there is a break in the railing (strafe to the left\
      \ as you pass the broken railing), and shoot down the glass door at the end.\
      \ Enter the control room, collecting Tarydium Shards if necessary, and press\
      \ the three cross-shaped switches.\n</p><p>Return along the catwalk. At the\
      \ second set of fans on the way back, hop off the railing into the fan pipe\
      \ on the left where the fan is moving very slowly and doesn't hurt you. Collect\
      \ the Assault Vest from behind. Stepping out of the tube, follow the air conditioning\
      \ duct and return to the crossroads. The door to the right is now open, so step\
      \ through and - hooray - you've completed the level!\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

    text: "[[Image:Rrajigarmine.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]\n'''Rrajigar Mine''' is the\
      \ third map in [[Unreal|Unreal's]] single player game.\n; Author : [[Cliffy\
      \ B]]\n; Description\n: The player arrives in the upper chamber of a grimy [[Skaarj]]\
      \ mining facility. Crystals of the much sought-after mineral Tarydium glimmer\
      \ in the caves, whilst lava rumbles in the depths of the lower levels. A few\
      \ [[Nali]] slaves are also cower in the mine's many corridors and rooms - can\
      \ they help our protagonist?\n; Note\n: Not to be confused with UT2004's [[DM-Rrajigar]].\n\
      {{clear}}\n\n==Weapons and Items==\nNew\n* [[Shield Belt]]\n* [[VoiceBox]]\n\

      \ Vest]]\n* [[Flare]]\n* [[Stinger|Tarydium Shards]]\n* [[Automag|Bullets]]\n\

      \n\nOld\n* [[Brute#Lesser Brutes|Lesser Brute]]\n* [[Tentacle]]\n* [[Nali]]\n\
      \n\n==Walkthrough==\nAnother contrast now as you move from the open areas of\
      \ [[NyLeve's Falls]] on a sunny day to within a claustrophobic mining facility.\
      \ However this route is the only one open to you, so follow it you must. Be\
      \ prepared because things are about to get really nasty.\n\nNow, proceed to\
      \ the end of the corridor in which you start so that you reach the mine entrance.\
      \ Make sure you have selected the [[Automag]], because your first critters are\
      \ just around the corner.\n\nIn the first room you will see two exits. There\
      \ is a [[Brute|LesserBrute]] patrolling the one on the left, so take him out\
      \ from a distance, remaining on the walkway on which you are standing. Then\
      \ collect the Automag and Clips from an unfortunate prisoner's corpse to the\
      \ right. Notice how the wall at the end of the walkway is in shadow; shadows\
      \ are always worth investigating in Unreal, so use your Flashlight (select it\
      \ and use your inventory use key to turn it on and off) to illuminate the area.\
      \ A small tunnel will be revealed; follow it to collect an Assault Vest at the\
      \ end.\n\nReturning to the starting area, there is a mining cart which you can\
      \ drop down into to find another prisoner's corpse, a Clip and a Health Pack.\
      \ Further Clips can be found on the larger metal crates in the middle of the\
      \ room, so push the small crate up to the bigger ones and use it as a step.\n\
      \nHead now to the door that the LesserBrute was patrolling. It is signed to\
      \ the Force Field Control Area [1].\n\nWell you haven't seen the force field\
      \ yet, so let's check it out first. Take the other exit from the start area,\
      \ into a rock tunnel illuminated by blue tarydium crystals. There will be a\
      \ small quake as you enter; also watch out for the [[Tentacle]] on the ceiling.\n\
      \nThe next room is guarded by a LesserBrute. Kill it, then head over to the\
      \ other corner on this side of the room where there are 3 Clips. Collect what\
      \ you need then walk over to the force field. The aforementioned force field\
      \ is barring a corridor [2].\n\nThat is not all there is to be done here though.\
      \ The red barrel on a nearby ledge contains unstable Tarydium, so shoot it and\
      \ it will blow up taking a nearby wall with it. Leap up on to the ledge (it\
      \ can be done) and follow the revealed tunnel, using your Flashlight or a Flare\
      \ if required. The small cave at the end contains a Health Pack, and corpses\
      \ of a prisoner and a Nali. The Nali's diary is nearby [3].\n\nYou have seen\
      \ all there is to see here; you need to deactivate the force field now so return\
      \ to the start area and head for the door to the Force Field Control Area.\n\
      \nEnter the corridor and press the button to call the lift. Stand on the lift\
      \ and it will descend automatically; a small ledge behind you as you descend\
      \ contains a Clip if you need it. Now follow the walkway - mind the Tentacle\
      \ on the way - collecting the Clip and trying not to fall into the lava until\
      \ you reach the next corridor. Collect the Clip as you enter the corridor, then\
      \ follow it. You will pass a collection of human corpses along the way which\
      \ you can ignore for now, and upon rounding the corner after that will meet\
      \ a Tentacle and wooden crates containing a Health Pack and a very useful [[Shield\
      \ Belt]] armour item.\n\nSoon you will come to a room with two power beams on\
      \ the left and two switches on the right, plus two consoles also identifying\
      \ the power beams as the Force Field power sources [4,5].\n\nFirst things first,\
      \ collect Clips from behind the power beams. Then press the two switches. The\
      \ power beams will die and the music will stop, and the messages on the consoles\
      \ will change [6,7]. \n\nNow set back off down the corridor. You should notice\
      \ the corpses now, because barriers will suddenly close walling you in. What\
      \ happened here to kill so many people in such a small space? You are trapped,\
      \ so get your Automag ready. Next, the lights will go out one by one from the\
      \ far end of the corridor, plunging you into darkness. Toss a couple of Flares\
      \ to help you keep your bearings. Be prepared for this - shortly after the lights\
      \ are all out, sections of wall at either end of the section of corridor will\
      \ open and, to the accompaniment of blinking red light, emergency claxons and\
      \ fast urgent music, out will come bounding your first [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScout]].\
      \ He is fast and deadly, so dispose of him quickly.\n\nWhen he is dead, the\
      \ barriers will be withdrawn. Collect two Flares, a Clip and a Health Pack from\
      \ the new alcoves, then head back out to the walkway by the lava. Now return\
      \ to starting area via the lift. Be warned, two LesserBrutes will have appeared\
      \ at the lift and at the start area, so keep your Automag at the ready.\n\n\
      Proceed to the door that was previously barred by the force field [8].\n\nEnter\
      \ the corridor, collecting Tarydium Shards as you go. Follow the corridor until\
      \ you reach a lift, then ride it down. As the lift goes back up it reveals two\
      \ Clips beneath if you need them. The next corridor arrives eventually at a\
      \ walkway over lava; watch out for the Tentacles and the LesserBrute patrolling\
      \ the area.\n\nIf you go left at the walkway, a Tarydium barrel can be used\
      \ to blow up two wooden crates, one of which contains a box of 50 Bullets. Beware\
      \ as you approach the walkway however as part of it will collapse into the lava.\
      \ Now head the other way along the walkway, where a short corridor on the right\
      \ contains two Health Packs. Continuing along the walkway another section collapses\
      \ so watch out.\n\nTip: If you fall into the lava, follow it round underneath\
      \ the walkway. A lift will descend and you can use it to get back on to dry\
      \ ground by the two Health Packs mentioned above.\n\nAt the next junction you\
      \ are faced with a choice; the left path, the middle path or the right path.\
      \ You can hear a Skaarj growling on the left, so don't go there yet. A Nali\
      \ can be heard praying to the right, and you don't want to draw him to the attention\
      \ of the Skaarj as the Skaarj will probably murder him. So instead, take the\
      \ middle path and follow the corridor. Collect Clips and Tarydium Shards as\
      \ you go.\n\nNow the SkaarjScout you heard growling may come and meet you in\
      \ the corridor. Most likely however he will be operating a console and you will\
      \ find that you come out behind him. Either way, dispose of him quickly without\
      \ leading him onto the Nali. The console he was operating has a message [9].\n\
      \nHead now to the left, along the walkway over the lava again, back in the direction\
      \ of the junction. Collect the [[VoiceBox]] inventory item as you go from behind\
      \ a pillar. Now go off to the left, where the Nali can be heard praying.\n\n\
      When you see the Nali, don't shoot him. Never shoot the Nali, because the more\
      \ you shoot them, or let them get killed, the less helpful all the Nali will\
      \ be to you as a whole. This particular Nali beckons for you to follow him;\
      \ do so, but grab Tarydium Shards and Health Packs from the crates first. The\
      \ Nali will lead you down the middle corridor and will open a secret compartment\
      \ in the wall, where there will be further Tarydium Shards and a very useful\
      \ [[Stinger]] weapon.\n\nFollow this corridor now to its end, so that you arrive\
      \ back at the Skaarj's console, and this time make a right. A gap with lava\
      \ below and a low beam blocks your way; shoot the red plate on the wall over\
      \ the lava and the beam will rise, making a handy bridge.\n\nCross the gap,\
      \ and take out the Tentacle hiding round the corner. Collect the Clip, and select\
      \ the Stinger. Enter the cave on the right, and you will be greeted by a SkaarjScout\
      \ who drops in from above. He is best taken out with the Stinger's secondary\
      \ fire mode. Mercifully now the action music from the first fight has stopped\
      \ and is no longer doing your head in.\n\nHaving disposed of the Skaarj, shoot\
      \ the tarydium barrels at the far end to open a hole in the wall. Follow the\
      \ new tunnel - collecting a Health Pack as you go - into the next room where\
      \ a LesserBrute will greet you. Now, step up to the lever on the left and press\
      \ it. Buttons will be revealed on the central column. Press all four to open\
      \ the doors around the room. Doing so will release an angry SkaarjScout whom\
      \ you should dispose of. The two corridors revealed each lead to the same lift,\
      \ and each contain two Tentacles and a Clip. Not much to choose really, take\
      \ either or both. Ride the lift up to the corridor above, being sure to collect\
      \ the Shield Belt from the alcove at the far end of said corridor (the Belt\
      \ will only be available if the Nali has survived unscathed).\n\nEnter the next\
      \ area - balconies over the room below - and grab the Stinger and Tarydium Shards.\
      \ Dispose of the SkaarjScout lurking beyond the central column. You might also\
      \ take this opportunity to kill the Tentacle that snipes from a walkway above.\n\
      \nCollect Health Packs from crates in the alcove on the left, then follow the\
      \ corridor off to the right. More music will start as you enter the next room.\
      \ Kill the Tentacle here then shoot the Tarydium Barrels to clear your passage\
      \ to the next area. Beyond is another room where you will be met by a SkaarjScout\
      \ and another Tentacle.\n\nRound the corner is another Tentacle and beyond that\
      \ a mechanism to access the upper balcony. Don't go there yet though; instead,\
      \ use your Flashlight (if your batteries are low then use a Flare) to illuminate\
      \ the shadow behind the crates to the left, and follow the revealed tunnel to\
      \ get a very useful +100 [[Super Health Pack]]. Now return and head for the\
      \ large red control switch in the next room.\n\nRemove the crate from the lift\
      \ pad as instructed [10]. Before using the lift however grab the Flare from\
      \ the corner under the balcony. Now, press the switch to summon the lift. Like\
      \ the sign said, don't stand underneath or the effect will not be as planned.\
      \ Climb aboard the lift when it has descended - the crate aboard contains a\
      \ Clip - and ride up to the balcony. Collect the Automag at the top (there's\
      \ also a clip on the metal box below the balcony).\n\nFurther along the balcony\
      \ you will find a LesserBrute and a Tentacle to dispose of. Collect Tarydium\
      \ Shards from the crates in the alcove, then continue down the next walkway,\
      \ taking out a further LesserBrute as you go. Follow the corridor until you\
      \ reach a Nali who will beckon to you, but don't follow him yet. Tread carefully\
      \ here; head out into the next room which contains mining carts, until you see\
      \ the SkaarjScout at the consoles. Try and kill it without it seeing the Nali.\
      \ Hopefully the Nali will have remained at the entrance, but if it has come\
      \ in it is as good as dead and there's nothing you can do to save it. If however\
      \ you are successful, then the Nali will operate the consoles to open an alcove\
      \ with a very useful Assault Vest. As you kill the Skaarj, he will drop a Health\
      \ Pack should you need it.\n\nPause now to collect Tarydium Shards from an alcove\
      \ in the other corner of the room, and to read the two consoles, one of which\
      \ warns you of unstable bridges in the lower half of the mine [11,12].\n\nHead\
      \ down the next walkway now. A Tentacle along the way lurks above crates containing\
      \ Tarydium Shards; having disposed of that, move on and drop down at the end\
      \ to the next corridor below. To the right here are Health Packs and a drop\
      \ back to earlier in the level, beware of the SkaarjScout that drops in behind\
      \ you if you go that way. Head now the other direction and you will reach a\
      \ bridge.\n\nFirst things first, take out the LesserBrute who shoots from the\
      \ platform on the left. Now, look at the bridge; these bridges are unsafe as\
      \ stated by the consoles, and tend to collapse. You have a choice. You can sprint\
      \ along via the Tarydium Shards behind the pillar and hope that you don't get\
      \ chucked into the lava below, or you can climb the bridge frame which is safe,\
      \ collecting the Clip at the top. This second choice has the added advantage\
      \ that you can easily make the jump to the area on the left where there is a\
      \ Shield Belt.\n\nIf you do get chucked in, it's only shallow so follow the\
      \ tunnel beneath where you came in (watch out as the ceiling collapses) to the\
      \ lift at the other end where there are also two boxes of 50 Bullets and a Health\
      \ Pack.\n\nNow return to the main walkway after the first bridge. Round the\
      \ corner are a LesserBrute and a Nali, so once again try to prevent the Nali\
      \ from getting killed. The Nali, as long as he has survived and you haven't\
      \ shot him or any other Nali so far, will open a cave containing a [[Dispersion\
      \ Pistol Powerup]], which significantly increases the power of your first weapon's\
      \ primary fire mode permanently.\n\nTip: You can draw the LesserBrute's fire\
      \ away from the Nali if you drop into the lava pit below the ledge before it\
      \ sees you, then jump from landmass to landmass and climb the plank to tackle\
      \ the LesserBrute.\n\nCross the second bridge - I recommend using the frame\
      \ as you can then catch the Clip on the door frame ahead - and head down the\
      \ next tunnel, dealing with the Tentacle on the ceiling. Entering the next room\
      \ beware of the SkaarjScout who jumps down from above.\n\nContinue through the\
      \ next room where there is a Health Pack, and into an area with a balcony, a\
      \ lift and pillars. A SkaarjScout on the balcony will come down the lift and\
      \ attack at this point, so dispose of him, then collect Tarydium Shards and\
      \ a Health Pack from crates behind the pillars. Use the lift to access the balcony\
      \ where there is a Stinger in a crate, and a ledge where a SkaarjScout is guarding\
      \ the next walkway below. Kill the Skaarj and collect the two ASMD Cores (ASMD\
      \ ammo) from his ledge. Drop down onto the left-hand of the two beams and follow\
      \ it, where you will eventually find two Clips and be able to drop down on to\
      \ some crates to get a Shield Belt. If you require any more Clips, then return\
      \ back up the ramp behind to the room with the lift, and this time take the\
      \ right hand beam. You will eventually reach two Clips at the other end.\n\n\
      Almost there now. Drop down onto the crossroads, where the closed door is locked.\
      \ Take instead the route which is off to the right when you first enter this\
      \ area, towards the lift. Collect what you require of the Health Pack and Tarydium\
      \ Shards here; you might also be well advised to dispose of the tarydium barrels\
      \ here, as you are about to be involved in a firefight. Press the switch, and\
      \ the lift will descend, bringing a LesserBrute down with it. Take him out,\
      \ then ride the lift yourself.\n\nYou will rise to a catwalk with railings going\
      \ through a room with large ventilation fans on either side. Sprint along making\
      \ sure that you don't get sucked off by the fast fan where there is a break\
      \ in the railing (strafe to the left as you pass the broken railing), and shoot\
      \ down the glass door at the end. Enter the control room, collecting Tarydium\
      \ Shards if necessary, and press the three cross-shaped switches.\n\nReturn\
      \ along the catwalk. At the second set of fans on the way back, hop off the\
      \ railing into the fan pipe on the left where the fan is moving very slowly\
      \ and doesn't hurt you. Collect the Assault Vest from behind. Stepping out of\
      \ the tube, follow the air conditioning duct and return to the crossroads. The\
      \ door to the right is now open, so step through and - hooray - you've completed\
      \ the level!\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"Force Field Control Area\"\n# \"\
