      \ and a <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a>,\

      \ title=\"UDamage\">UDamage</a> and <a href=\"/Berserk\" title=\"Berserk\">Berserk</a>\
      \ and the Rocket Launcher locks in targets almost instantly. Additionally, a\
      \ Titan can perform a close-range radius attack by pressing the Use key (by\
      \ default E or Enter), which does massive damage to nearby enemies and has a\
      \ shockwave effect similar to the <a href=\"/Darkwalker\" title=\"Darkwalker\"\
      >Darkwalker</a>'s secondary blast fire mode. This shockwave has a greater radius\
      \ than the melee damage itself and can knock enemies off their feet and out\
      \ of certain vehicles. Like with the Darkwalker blast, <a href=\"/Scavenger\"\
      \ title=\"Scavenger\">Scavengers</a> are forced into ball mode when hit by a\
      \ Titan melee blast.\n</p><p>All this power comes with a price: Titans are slower\
      \ than regular players and their size may restrict them from certain areas of\
      \ the map. The main disadvantage, however, is that Titans can no longer touch-interact\
      \ with game objectives, use jump pads or anything that requires the Use key,\
      \ e.g. entering vehicles or using <a href=\"/Warfare\" title=\"Warfare\">Warfare</a>\
      \ teleporters. Transforming into a Titan is irreversible, the only way to become\
      \ regular again is to die. If you die as a Titan, you go out with a bang, though.\n\
      </p><p>Titans continue to score \"hero points\" and when their \"hero meter\"\
      \ is full, the player can press the transformation key again to turn into a\
      \ Behemoth. Becoming a Behemoth doubles the player size again and further reduces\
      \ the movement speed in exchange for 800 points of health and shield. This additional\
      \ boost has a very important drawback, a limited lifetime. Behemoths only survive\
      \ 45 seconds. After that, the player blows up automatically.\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      <p>Titans are tough opponents. If you see one and are on foot, prepare to respawn\
      \ soon. Their massive amounts of health and raw firepower make them difficult\
      \ to attack directly.\n</p><p>Apart from the protection via the massive amount\
      \ of hitpoints, Titans also take damage very similar to vehicles. Not exactly\
      \ like vehicles, but the same damage multipliers apply. That means <a href=\"\
      /Enforcer\" title=\"Enforcer\">Enforcers</a> are useless and <a href=\"/Stinger\"\
      \ title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> or <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper\
      \ Rifle\">Sniper Rifle</a> only do limited damage. The <a href=\"/Impact_Hammer\"\
      \ title=\"Impact Hammer\">Impact Hammer</a> still works as against regular players,\
      \ but at only 20% of the damage output. An <a href=\"/AVRiL\" title=\"AVRiL\"\
      >AVRiL</a>, while not being able to lock onto Titans, does 200 points of damage,\
      \ though.\n</p><p>Things that can really hurt a Titan are long range attacks\
      \ with the <a href=\"/SPMA\" title=\"SPMA\">SPMA</a> or <a href=\"/Eradicator\"\
      \ title=\"Eradicator\">Eradicator</a> and self-destruction attacks by <a href=\"\
      /Scorpion\" title=\"Scorpion\">Scorpions</a> or <a href=\"/Viper\" title=\"\
      Viper\">Vipers</a>. Titans don't take any damage from vehicles running into\
      \ them, with the notable exception of \"Pancake\" kills. Be careful about trying\
      \ to pancake a Titan, as this will heavily damage the vehicle and usually destroy\
      \ it as well.\n</p><p>Against a Behemoth you could just play out your size advantage\
      \ and hide away in a spot the Behemoth can't reach. Behemoths are four times\
      \ as tall and wide as regular players, so especially on indoor maps they are\
      \ quite limited in which places they can reach. If you can get to such a place,\
      \ you can just sit out the Behemoth's suicide timer. Otherwise the same strategies\
      \ as against Titans apply.\n</p><p>In any case, if you have killed a Titan or\
      \ Behemoth - run for your life. The subsequent explosion has the same devastating\
      \ effect as a <a href=\"/Redeemer\" title=\"Redeemer\">Redeemer</a> missile.\n\
