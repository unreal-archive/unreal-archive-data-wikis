      \ What's more, the gun can also move the target without resistance, meaning\
      \ that expert gunners will catch the Manta and bring it in the tank's line of\
      \ fire. Conversely, enemy G5 wielders can be grabbed and thrown away, distrupting\
      \ their laser painter's aim, thereby redirecting the missile away from the tank\
      \ (the only thing that can withstand a direct G5 hit is a Paladin's shield and\
      \ a Leviathan). The UT2004 tutorial says that \"the Shield Gun can be particularly\
