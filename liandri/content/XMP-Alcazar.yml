      \ There are one to three teleporters per floor. First floor has three teleporters:\
      \ the one opposite the exit takes players directly to the Artifact node (third\
      \ floor), while both of the two other teleporters take you to the second floor.\
      \ Second floor has walkways that take you to jump pads that could be used as\
      \ an alternative route to the Artifact node. Second floor also has an exit that\
      \ leads to the shattered bridge, as well as Health and Energy stations. There\
      \ is one unhackable Deploy Point per each floor.\n</p><p>The valley, as opposed\
      \ to the identical alcazars, is not entirely symmetrical. There are two <a href=\"\
      /Raptor_(XMP_vehicle)\" title=\"Raptor (XMP vehicle)\">Raptors</a> in a small\
      \ structure near each base. There are two Energy Generators in the valley -\
      \ one, called Valley Generator, is in a medium-sized concrete structure in the\
      \ west of the valley, and the other one, called Underbridge Generator, is in\
      \ the north-east of the valley in a canyon. Near the each of them are <a href=\"\
      /Juggernaut_(XMP_vehicle)\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Juggernaut (XMP vehicle)\"\
      >Juggernaut</a> spawn points. Valley Generator has a bunker with a Health Station\
      \ nearby. There are two Deploy Points - one is on top of a mountain in the east\
      \ of the map, and the second one is near the red alcazar on a sand dune. Two\
      \ more <a href=\"/Harbinger\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Harbinger\">Harbinger</a>\

      \ only from the second floor of both alcazars, is a huge bridge that is broken\
      \ on both sides of it. The center is held in place by unknown forces. There\
      \ you can find another Energy Generator, the Cloud Generator, a Deploy Point\
      \ and two <a href=\"/Raptor_(XMP_vehicle)\" title=\"Raptor (XMP vehicle)\">Raptors</a>.\
      \ There are also two Ammo Stations, an Energy Station and a Health station there.\
      \ On both ends of the bridge are Health and Energy stations as well as Shield\
      \ Wall triggers that are unique to this map. They, once activated, deploy a\
      \ wall of energy that stops anyone from entering or exiting for a short period\
      \ of time. The Shield Wall, however, doesn't extend all the way to the ground\

      \ useless. Both triggers can be hacked.\n</p><p>To reach the center of the bridge,\
      \ a player has to perform a dodge jump (best if they also use their speed boost\

      Alcazar is a big [[XMP]] level featuring two fortresses (alcazars) for each\

      \ Mine]] jumping. Gunners can deploy Laser Trip mines in two places: in the\
      \ entrance of the first floor of each alcazars and on top of the shattered bridge,\
      \ below the walkways to the Deploy Point. One Laser Trip Mine jump will send\

      \ the direct teleporter on the first floor of the alcazars.\n* Jump pads on\
      \ the second floor of both alcazars can be used to annoy base defenders. Jump\
      \ on one of them, and once you're at the top, fire at a player or an automated\
      \ defense, then fall down on the same Jump Pad and repeat. Be careful to fall\
      \ down exactly on the pad, or you'll kill yourself!\n* It is worth taking the\
      \ Cloud deploy point, as there are all types of stations, two vehicles and one\
      \ energy generator there. Besides, you start closer to the enemy and it's not\
      \ as easy to get there.\n* Best places to deploy turrets are Artifact Node rooms\
      \ and the center of the shattered bridge. There is usually only one way enemies\
      \ can come from there, and enemies that come to the shattered bridge center\
      \ will have only 50% of personal energy left, resulting in inability to jump\
      \ for a short time.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Alcazar is alphabetically the first official\
      \ map in eXpanded MutiPlayer. That makes it the usual mod testing place.\n*\
      \ It is possible to fall off the bridge but stay alive by using cliffs to stop\
      \ the falling. It is also possible to enter a vehicle while falling and thus\
      \ take no damage.\n\n==Pictures==\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nImage:alcazar1.jpg|The\
