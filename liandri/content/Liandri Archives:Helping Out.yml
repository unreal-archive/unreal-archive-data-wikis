      \ place all the necessary links <i>from</i> the page, but it can be much less\
      \ convenient to track down all the other pages that should link to their new\
      \ page.  While looking over a page, click on the \"What Links Here\" button\

      \ whether the list of \"What Links Here\" pages seems comparable in length to\

  wikitext:
    text: "[[Category:Helping Out|{{PAGENAME}}]]\nThere are many ways to '''help the\
      \ wiki'''. Our goal is to document everything about the [[Unreal series]], and\
      \ anyone who would like to help is welcome to contribute.\n\nEditors are free\
      \ to work on any project that they find interesting.  If you're reading a page\
      \ and see something that needs to be fixed, just click on the [[Help:Editing\
      \ Pages|\"edit\"]] button and fix it.  If you're looking for something that\
      \ needs to be done, this page provides some suggestions.\n\n==General Page Improvement==\n\
      The ideas in this section can be applied to almost any page on the site; while\
      \ you are reading articles, keep in mind whether any of these improvements are\
      \ needed on the page.  In addition, there are various [[:Category:Needs Maintenance|categories]]\
      \ and [[Special:specialpages|Special Pages]] where articles that have been tagged\
      \ as needing improvements are listed.  You can browse through any of those categories\
      \ and see if any of the pages are on topics that you're knowledgeable about.\
      \  Or you can add any page that you think needs maintenance to a category to\
      \ let other editors know that page needs work.\n\nIf you're uncertain about\
      \ anything, or have any questions you'd like answered before jumping in and\
      \ starting to edit, feel free to ask!  You can post any questions you might\
      \ have on this article's [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|talk page]], you can ask a [[Project:Mentor\
      \ Program|mentor]] to help you, or you can add a question to any talk page on\
      \ the site, and an editor will try to help out.\n\n===Create New Articles===\n\
      Are we missing something? If there are a lot of pages that link to an empty\
      \ page, you may want to [[Help:Starting New Pages|create it]]. [[Help:Links|Links]]\
      \ in blue represent pages that have been created, and links in red represent\
      \ pages that have not been created. If an editor creates a red link, it is an\
      \ indication that he believes an article should be created at the target location.\n\
      \nNot all red link pages should be immediately created.  Before creating a new\
      \ page at the target location you should:\n* First check whether a page discussing\
      \ that topic already exists. If so, fix all of the links and make them point\
      \ to the correct page instead.\n* Only create a new page if you can fill in\
      \ more than a single sentence. New pages should try to provide a complete discussion\
      \ of the page's topic. If you don't know enough to fill in more than one sentence,\
      \ it is better to leave the page as a red link. Then other editors can more\
      \ easily identify which pages need work.\nIf you believe there should be an\
      \ article on the other end of a link and you have some good ideas about what\
      \ to put there, then by all means start writing it!\n* [[Special:Wantedpages|Wanted\
      \ Pages]] provides a list of all the pages that exist as \"red links\".  Click\
      \ on the page name to create it; click on the \"# links\" link to see what pages\
      \ have the links and fix those pages if more appropriate.\n\n===Expanding Articles===\n\
      Many articles can be expanded and improved upon. You could roam the site looking\
      \ for articles that you feel are too vague, then elaborate on them. You could\
      \ also expand upon [[:Category:Stubs|stubs]], which are articles that have not\
      \ received substantial attention from other editors and do not have a sufficient\
      \ amount of information.\n* [[:Category:Stubs|Stubs]] provides a list of minimal\
      \ length articles that need to be fleshed out.\n\n===Cleaning Up Articles===\n\
      There are (unfortunately) always articles that do not meet the site's [[Project:Style\
      \ Guide|style guidelines]].  Some common problems with articles include:\n*\
      \ Incorrect [[Project:Spelling|Spelling]] or grammar.\n* Use of [[Project:Style\
      \ Guide#No First Person|first person]] perspective.\n* Pages that do not include\
      \ proper wiki [[Help:Formatting|formatting]].\nPages that have been identified\
      \ as needing to be cleaned up are listed at:\n* [[:Category:Pages Needing Cleanup|Pages\
      \ Needing Cleanup]]: any type of general cleanup; typically the known problems\
      \ are listed on the article or on its talk page.\n* [[:Category:Pages Without\
      \ Formal Tone|Pages Without Formal Tone]]: pages that do not have a style appropriate\
      \ for an encyclopedia.\n* [[:Category:Pages Needing Wikification|Pages Needing\
      \ Wikification]]: pages that need wiki formatting; often these pages will also\
      \ need to have [[#Adding Links|links added]].\n\n===Adding Suggestions===\n\
      If you believe any article needs improvements or fixes, but you don't know how\
      \ to do it yourself, then post a message on the article's talk page.  For example,\
      \ if you don't understand anything on this article or think that there is missing\
      \ information, just edit [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|the talk page]] (also accessible\
      \ on any page by clicking the link that says \"discussion\") and type in your\
      \ suggestions.  Suggestions on how to make it easier to find information or\
      \ pointers about basic information that has been overlooked is particularly\
      \ welcome: the more experienced editors who add a lot of the wiki's content\
      \ have a hard time remembering what it was like as a new editor ;)\n\n===Adding\
      \ Links===\nMany necessary [[Help:Links|links]] between wiki pages are missing,\
      \ which makes it harder for readers to find information.  If you are reading\
      \ a page and realize that it contains few or no links, add some (although [[Project:Style\
      \ Guide#Avoid Cluttering Links|in moderation]]).\n\nAn even more prevalent problem\
      \ with wiki pages is that links ''to'' the page are often missing.  When new\
      \ pages are created, editors will often make sure to place all the necessary\
      \ links ''from'' the page, but it can be much less convenient to track down\
      \ all the other pages that should link to their new page.  While looking over\
      \ a page, click on the \"What Links Here\" button (in the toolbox at the bottom\
      \ of the left-hand side of the page), and see whether the list of \"What Links\
      \ Here\" pages seems comparable in length to the number of links on the page.\
      \  If you only see two or three pages in \"What Links Here\", check whether\
      \ any of the linked-to pages could be improved with a new link or two.\n\n*\
      \ [[Special:Lonelypages|Orphaned Pages]]: pages that are not linked to by any\
      \ other wiki pages.  In general, other pages should be edited to add links to\
      \ these pages (although there are exceptions, i.e., permanently orphaned pages\
      \ that do not need to be fixed).\n* [[:Category:Pages Needing Wikification|Pages\
      \ Needing Wikification]]: pages in general need of wiki formatting, which often\
      \ includes adding links.\n\n===Adding Images===\nThere are many screenshots,\
      \ maps, and other images that would help to make articles more informative.\
      \  [[Help:Images|Images]] provides information on image formats and how to obtain\
      \ good quality screenshots.\n* [[:Category:Pages Needing Images|Pages Needing\
      \ Images]] lists pages that have been identified as needing an image.\n\n===Other\
      \ Maintenance===\nOther categories and special pages that list pages needing\
      \ maintenance include:\n* [[:Category:Pages Needing Peer Review|Pages Needing\
      \ Peer Review]]: discussions where an editor would like input from the rest\
      \ of the community.\n* [[:Category:Pages Needing Verification|Pages Needing\
      \ Verification]]: pages that include facts that have not yet been confirmed\n\
      * [[Special:BrokenRedirects|Broken Redirects]]: Redirect pages that link to\
      \ non-existent pages (often they need to be [[Project:Deletion Policy#Proposed\
      \ Deletion|proposed for deletion]]).\n* [[Special:DoubleRedirects|Double Redirects]]:\
      \ Redirect pages that link to another redirect page.  The redirect needs to\
      \ be edited to point to a real wiki page.\n* [[Special:Wantedcategories|Wanted\
      \ Categories]]: [[Project:Categories|Categories]] that have had pages added\
      \ to them, but the container page has not been created.\n\n==Helping the Community==\n\
      ===Monitoring Articles===\nUnfortunately, many people who do not understand\
      \ our goals come through here and make careless edits or edits that otherwise\
      \ do not comply with the [[Project:Style Guide|style guide]]; [[Project:Vandalism|vandalism]]\
      \ occasionally happens.  These edits are caught and fixed by editors who monitor\
      \ the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]].  While there are some [[Project:Patrollers|patrollers]]\
      \ who are given a couple of special tools to help monitor recent changes, any\
      \ editors are welcome to help out. Sometimes this means rewording a new contribution\
      \ to a page, and sometimes this means deleting it.\n\nIf you find that you enjoy\
      \ monitoring the recent changes page and tend to be frequently checking it,\
      \ you may wish to nominate yourself to join the site's [[Project:Patrollers|Patrollers]].\n\
      \n===Answering Questions===\nThere are frequently questions that get asked by\
      \ other contributors, either on the [[Project:Reference Desk|Reference Desk]],\
      \ or on article talk pages.  If you know the answer (or even a partial answer)\
      \ to any question, feel free to answer it.  Recent questions can be identified\
      \ from the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]] page; older questions can\
      \ be found by checking the talk pages of articles that you are reading.\n\n\
      ===Helping Other Users===\nMany users don't know some of the ways they can help\
      \ on the wiki. You could help them out by sharing with them some of your knowledge,\
      \ and encouraging them to get active and find something to start editing. One\
      \ of the ways to identify yourself as someone that would like to help others\
      \ is to place your name on the [[Project:Mentor Program|mentor program]]. Another\
      \ way is to look at the [[Special:Recentchanges|recent changes]] page and to\
      \ look for newcomers or anonymous editors who have been making some good edits.\
      \ Encourage them to get a new account if they haven't, and show them around\
      \ the community.\n\n===Public Relations===\nWe need more people that are interested\
      \ in reading what we write about, and we need more people that are interested\
      \ in writing. The {{SITENAME}} does not advertise formally, so it requires people\
      \ like you to spread the word to make this site bigger and better. Don't resort\
      \ to spamming, because it makes us look bad and makes people unhappy, but just\
      \ keep an eye out for people that may be interested. You could put a link to\
      \ us in your signature on the [http://forums.epicgames.com/ official forums],\
      \ for example, or you could show people who need help some of our articles.\n\
      \n==Projects==\nThe [[Project:Task List|Task List]] provides a list of projects\
      \ that other editors have identified as needing to be done.  Everyone is invited\
      \ to look through the list and add new projects or find projects that they would\
      \ like to work on.\n\n==See Also==\n* [[Project:Getting Started|Getting Started]]\
      \ - A guide for new editors\n* [[Project:Style Guide|Style Guide]] - General\
      \ guidelines for how to write, format, and present pages.\n* [[Project:Policies\
      \ and Guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]] - Important rules and guidelines\
