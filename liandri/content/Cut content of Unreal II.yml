      \ anything, dealing 100 points of damage. The sounds, particle effect and leftover\

      <p>The actual concept is far from the current U2XMP. It was initially meant\
      \ to be a much more strategy based game, even called \"Real-time strategy in\
      \ a shooter game\" by a few review sites. Each team initially started with one\
      \ Replicator and a few Energy Relays in their possession. Energy Relays were\
      \ meant to be used to get energy from Energy Sources, instead of the later Hacking.\
      \ An Energy Source could fit up to 8 Energy Relays, but the energy output was\
      \ shared between all of them equally, and the sum of all individual Relays generated\
      \ energy equals the energy generated by a single Relay if it's the only one\
      \ attached to the Source.\n</p><p>Each Energy Relay had an amount of health\
      \ that was automatically regenerated by stopping all of the energy production\
      \ and then using the energy to heal itself. If a player destroyed an enemy Relay,\
      \ he would have gotten points equal to those given from destroying an Automated\
      \ Defense deployable. This introduces a variety of strategies - you could either\
      \ lock the generator by placing 8 Relays at a single source, place relays on\
      \ already used enemy generators to steal energy or place one Relay on each Generator\
      \ to save time.\n</p><p>Replicators were the heart of the game. They were used\
      \ to generate all the technology for the team. They were controlled by players\
      \ that were either Techs or had a rank of Commander. Replicators were immobile\
      \ and appeared to be much like computers. When used, players were given two\
      \ categories to choose from - Research and Production. All technologies had\
      \ to be researched before being able to produce anything. All operations take\
      \ an amount of time and energy (as a rule, better technology takes more time\
      \ and consequently more energy). Technologies have to be researched only a single\
      \ time before production can be started. Only one operation can be executed\
      \ at a time, so there's nearly infinite amount of possibilities of using the\
      \ Replicator.\n</p><p>The core of the gameplay, as in U2XMP, is to capture an\
      \ amount of <a href=\"/edit/Artifact?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Artifact\
      \ (page does not exist)\">Artifacts</a>. But unlike U2XMP, artifacts could be\
      \ placed absolutely anywhere in the map, giving more possibilities for Level\
      \ Designers. Artifacts could be placed like in U2XMP - in the enemy base, or\
      \ out in the environment. Each of them could require different qualities to\
      \ reach - one could be accessible only by jumping over lava pits, the other\
      \ would require you to go through a room full of monsters from the single player\
      \ game while the third could require you to solve a puzzle or go through a maze.\
      \ Generally the gametype was highly customisable and thus let Level Designers\
      \ have an almost unlimited control over the gameplay.\n</p><p>Unlike U2XMP,\
      \ it was meant to be a pickup-based gametype, but items don't respawn like in\
      \ the single player campaign. Instead, you have to use the Replicator to get\
      \ the items you need. To make it less annoying, you only have to get the weapons,\
      \ and ammo comes in \"Ammo Packs\" for individual player classes. Each player\
      \ class could use a lot more weapons than in U2XMP, although still had their\
      \ own restrictions. For example, Rangers were the only ones that could use the\
      \ Sniper Rifle, while Gunners were the only ones that could use the Grenade\
      \ Launcher. Each class also had different starting weapons (except the <a href=\"\
      /Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a>, which\
      \ was available for everyone).\n</p><p>Jet packs were also not a part of the\
      \ energy suits of players. Instead, they had to be researched and produced with\
      \ Replicators as all other items. That's why <a href=\"/Field_Generator\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Field Generator\">Field Generators</a> were useful - you\
      \ can't just jump over them if you don't have a Jet Pack.\n</p><p>Replicators\
      \ could also produce all kinds of things, ranging from deployables to vehicles\
      \ to security cameras and security bots. There were also research-only options,\
      \ for example, Manned Turrets. Level Designers could also configure what teams\
      \ are allowed to build and what not. All production went to special Level Designer\
      \ marked storage rooms to make it more realistic.\n</p><p>It might sound as\
      \ if it required a large team of players to make the gametype playable. But\
      \ bot support was available and already in Unreal II, and even if bots were\
      \ disabled, a one-on-one match was possible, without even restricting players\
      \ to the Tech class. If there is only one player in a team, he automatically\
      \ becomes the Commander. Commanders have no pickup restrictions and can operate\
      \ Replicators even if their class is not Tech. Replicators were also meant to\
      \ have queues, so the player can select what he wants to get and let the Replicator\
      \ work for him. And even if it wasn't operated, it would automatically research\
      \ and build what it thinks would be useful for the team.\n</p><p>The gametype\
      \ was never complete due to the lack of time. The project was ambitious, and\
      \ Legend Entertainment simply didn't have enough time to complete the gametype.\
      \ A lot of alpha-state code is still in Unreal II, though, and it allowed us\
      \ to find out most of facts about the original XMP that we see in this article.\
      \ The gametype was never attempted to be remade to the original form (U2XMP\
      \ was made in a hurry and was simplified for a small team with only a few months\
      \ of time to complete the task) mostly because not many people knew of the gametype.\n\

    text: "{{Cut content}}\nExactly half of the game was cut from [[Unreal II: The\
      \ Awakening]]. This page lists most of the cut content, although it is likely\
      \ that there were more things cut from the game.\n\n==Races==\nThree races ([[N]],\
      \ [[Striders]], [[Shian]]) that include nine or more enemies were cut from the\
      \ game. Different versions of [[Izarians]] were not included as well.\n\n===The\
      \ N===\n{{mainarticle|N}}\n{{quote|The N are trans-dimensional aliens that can\
      \ occupy many simultaneous places in space and time. In reality, there are only\
      \ three N – but because they can somehow be in more than one place at once,\
      \ there appear to be hundreds of thousands of them. N weapons are all ranged\
      \ and psi-based – and each of the three N has a different weapon. You can't\
      \ really 'kill' an N – when you shoot one, the weapon simply depletes the energy\
      \ used to fold space and time at that particular node of the N.|FGN Online}}\n\
      There were three different N that could clone itself. None of the content was\
      \ included, although some of the OGG tracks might have been used for their levels.\
      \ See the [[N|main article]] for more information.\n\n===The Striders===\n{{mainarticle|Striders}}\n\
      {{quote|The Striders grow their own armor, weapons, and even spaceships. One\
      \ Strider Pod alone is not intimidating at all – a conical blob of goo on four\
      \ squat legs that is dumb as a post and is armed with little more than serrated\
      \ teeth. Unfortunately, the Pods will combine with each other to form the much\
      \ harder Strider Villains. And multiple Strider Villains can clump to create\
      \ a towering and lethal Strider Nemesis with dramatically increased intelligence\
      \ and firepower. The larger Strider monsters can navigate around obstacles and\
      \ through small openings by disassembling themselves long enough to get past\
      \ or through.|FGN Online}}\nStriders had three forms - Strider pod, Strider\
      \ Villain and Strider Nemesis. None of the content was included in the game,\
      \ but some OGG tracks might have been made for their levels. They are also oficcialy\
      \ mentioned in the Unreal Tournament timeline and in the game itself. See the\
      \ [[Striders|main article]] for more information.\n\n===The Shian===\n{{mainarticle|Shian}}\n\
      [[Image:U2_UglyFish.PNG|thumb|right|200px|The Ugly Fish, one of the Shian helpers]]\n\
      {{quote|The Shian are an underwater community (and the underwater regions look\

      \ with you telepathically, in that your mind simply \"hears what they're saying.\"\
      \ Where this really comes into play is that they, just like fairy tale mermaids,\
      \ are able to summon all the sea creatures in the area to serve in the battle.\
      \ You'll spend a lot of time not fighting them directly, but instead fighting\
      \ all the creatures that they're summoning from different parts of the ocean.|Cleaned\
      \ BeyondUnreal}}\nThe [[Shian]] could summon at least 8 different sea creatures\
      \ (see the main article). The Shian were one of the most important races, together\
      \ with the Drakk and the [[Skaarj]] in Unreal II. Some of the content is left\
      \ in the game - the pawns ShianWorker and ShianWarrior, the music - Mission_07Ambient,\
      \ Mission_07Battle and Mission_07Underwater, which makes it possible to imagine\
      \ them, and the meshes of the sea creatures. See the [[Shian|main article]]\

      \ single Izarian vambrace]]\nThe [[Izarians]] in Unreal II are seen only without\
      \ armor, but it was planned that there would be different versions of Izarians,\
      \ including armored Izarians and bald Izarians. The armor of Izarians included\
      \ only a set of spiky vambraces though. These versions are never seen in the\
      \ game, but are viewable in UnrealEd. Unfortunately, their meshes are aligned\
      \ wrongly.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Weapons==\nSix weapons (Tractor Beam, Stun Baton,\
      \ Mind Claw, Razik, Shock Rifle, Flak Cannon) were cut from Unreal II. Some\
      \ weapons have been changed, cutting some of their functions.\n\n===Tractor\
      \ Beam===\n{{quote|The last and hardest thing to really put into words was one\
      \ of the multiplayer levels that we got a glimpse at that was set in an asteroid\

      \ the Tractor Beam. It was not included in the game, but there is a test item\
      \ called a Grapple in UnrealEd.\n\n===Stun Baton===\nThe Stun Baton obviously\
      \ was a melee weapon and could stun enemies. It was included in the Alpha version\
      \ of Unreal II though. From that code, it seems that the Stun Baton was very\
      \ similar to the Control Baton of [[Wikipedia:Red Faction|Red Faction]]. It\
      \ could be charged and then used stab attack, or could be double swinged. If\
      \ you wish to see the full code, see it in [http://pastebin.com/f406ad805 the\
      \ pastebin].\n\n===Mind Claw===\n[[Image:MindClaw.PNG|thumb|left|150px|The Mind\
      \ Claw]]\n[[Image:MindClawDisplay.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Mind Claw on a screen]]\n\
      {{quote|\"A fearsome psi-weapon\", \"a crystal-based psionic weapon that channels\
      \ health from your enemies to you\"|Cleaned BeyondUnreal}}\nAs the N had psi\
      \ powers, it might be true that the Mind Claw belonged to them, but was stolen\
      \ by [[John Dalton]]. The mesh of the Mind Claw is still in the UnrealEd of\
      \ Unreal II, and the code was in the Alpha version of Unreal II. It reveals\
      \ that the primary fire could inflict damage and then absorb some of it (usually\
      \ 0.2 for 1 HP) to the attacker's health; the secondary fire, not finished in\
      \ the Alpha, was a some kind of Anti-Magic Aura effect around the player. See\
      \ the [http://pastebin.com/f2364c85b pastebin] for the full code.\n{{clear}}\n\
      \n===Razik===\n[[Image:Razik.PNG|thumb|right|200px|The Razik of Unreal II]]\n\
      {{mainarticle|Razik}}\nThe [[Razik]], codenamed SkaarjGlove, was originally\
      \ thought to be a weapon dropped by the [[Skaarj]]. It could fire all of the\
      \ projectiles of the different Skaarj classes, and could be used as a melee\
      \ weapon. It was never finished, but the sounds and the mesh is included in\
      \ the game, even though it was never used. The code was included in the Alpha\
      \ version of Unreal II, you can see it in the [http://pastebin.com/f1793f155\
      \ pastebin].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Singularity Cannon===\n[[Image:QuantumWave.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The\
      \ Quantum Wave effect.]]\nThe [[Singularity Cannon]], though included in the\
      \ game, was originally planned to have a secondary fire. It was codenamed Quantum\
      \ Wave. It was a kind of a vortex that would expand rapidly after being shot,\
      \ and would eventually explode when hit anything, dealing 100 points of damage.\
      \ The sounds, particle effect and leftover code are still in Unreal II. You\
      \ can compare it to the Alpha code which you can see in the [http://pastebin.com/f452aa658\
      \ pastebin].\n\nThe Singularity Cannon had ammo as well, codenamed Quantum Core,\
      \ which is in the full game and is complete, but lacks the mesh and was never\
      \ used in the game.\n\n===Leech Gun===\nThe Leech Gun, that was later replaced\
      \ by the [[Spider Gun]], was quite different. The primary fire was a leech that\
      \ chased enemies around and could even jump over gaps. The secondary fire was\
      \ a leech that sticked to the walls and waited for enemies to come. In the full\
      \ Unreal II, the gun was totally replaced by the Spider Gun, and the Leech Gun\
      \ code was only seen in the Alpha version of Unreal II. You can see it in the\
      \ [http://pastebin.com/f7f087187 pastebin].\n\n===Grenade Launcher===\nThe [[Grenade\
      \ Launcher]] was planned to be a little different from what it is now. The primary\
      \ fire was for releasing a bouncing grenade, while the alternative fire was\
      \ for releasing an instant exploding grenade. The Grenade Launcher had six grenades\
      \ - five of them is in the finished game, but the Concussion grenade was originally\
      \ planned to be a Stasis grenade that adjusted the enemy's speed, much like\
      \ the [[Deployables#Stasis_Field|Stasis Field]] of [[Unreal Tournament 3]].\
      \ See the [http://pastebin.com/f644ee4c9 pastebin] for the alpha code.\n\n==Maps\
      \ and Gametypes==\n\n===Maps===\n{{quote|The number of levels is starting to\

      \ of the maps being hard to configure for co-op play. This quote from the Infogrames\
      \ forum explains their decision:\n{{quote|We've said it several times before,\

      \ and quite a bit of non-linear gameplay. No, all that will not take away from\
      \ the action (Unreal was an action FPS game and U2 will be the same), but it's\
      \ simply impossible to include a coop mode that works well and is bug-free (do\
      \ you have any idea how easily scripted sequences break when there's more than\
      \ one player? ;)) without adding a few more months to the schedule. We realize\
      \ that a lot of the hard-core fans love coop, but we have to make tradeoffs\
      \ here. HL is still the biggest FPS game out there, and it doesn't have coop\
      \ (nor do I hear many people *****ing about it). If you want coop you should\
      \ wait until a 3rd party team creates a mod for it - until then you can play\
      \ straight action-shooters like Serious Sam :)|Matthias Worch on Infogrames'\
      \ U2 forum}}\nTechnically, as Mattchias Worch explained, it would have been\
      \ possible to create co-op mode. If Legend had made co-op support, Unreal II\
      \ would be a lot more played nowadays. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, it\
      \ was never finished, and even though it is still possible to see fragments\

      \ it is in the game. It is possible to play deathmatch and Capture the Flag\

      \ split the community and hurt eachother’s sales. Thus Epic, Infogrames, Legend\
      \ and DE sat together and re-arranged the whole release schedule and features\
      \ of the two games. It was decided that UT2003 would be strictly multiplayer\
      \ and released in mid 2002, while U2 would be strictly a story-based singleplayer\
      \ game, to be released end of 2002.|Cleaned BeyondUnreal}}\n\nThe list of gametypes\
      \ that were planned to be in Unreal II on release follows:\n\n*[[Single Player]]\n\

      \ eXpanded MultiPlayer===\n[[eXpanded MultiPlayer]] was intended to be a lot\
      \ different than it turned out to be in the end (again due to lack of time).\
      \ A quote taken from the pre-release Unreal II website (a recreation of which\
      \ can be found [http://unreal2.xsa1.com/ here]) approximately shows how it was\
      \ meant to be:\n{{Quote|In the new expanded multiplayer game, player teams will\
      \ fight for control of planet surfaces and alien artifacts using nanotechnology\
      \ replicators to build ever more sophisticated weapons such as automated gun\
      \ turrets, force fields, sensors, recon and repair robots, and more. Players\
      \ will choose one of three player classes at the beginning of play - class selection\
      \ establishes a balance of speed, special abilities, armor, and firepower. All\
      \ races, abilities, weapons, equipment, and tactics will have precedents in\
      \ the single player game - but the expanded multiplayer experience brings everything\
      \ together at the same time.|[http://unreal2.xsa1.com/ Unreal II website]}}\n\
      \nThe actual concept is far from the current U2XMP. It was initially meant to\
      \ be a much more strategy based game, even called \"Real-time strategy in a\
      \ shooter game\" by a few review sites. Each team initially started with one\
      \ Replicator and a few Energy Relays in their possession. Energy Relays were\
      \ meant to be used to get energy from Energy Sources, instead of the later Hacking.\
      \ An Energy Source could fit up to 8 Energy Relays, but the energy output was\
      \ shared between all of them equally, and the sum of all individual Relays generated\
      \ energy equals the energy generated by a single Relay if it's the only one\
      \ attached to the Source.\n\nEach Energy Relay had an amount of health that\
      \ was automatically regenerated by stopping all of the energy production and\
      \ then using the energy to heal itself. If a player destroyed an enemy Relay,\
      \ he would have gotten points equal to those given from destroying an Automated\
      \ Defense deployable. This introduces a variety of strategies - you could either\
      \ lock the generator by placing 8 Relays at a single source, place relays on\
      \ already used enemy generators to steal energy or place one Relay on each Generator\
      \ to save time.\n\nReplicators were the heart of the game. They were used to\
      \ generate all the technology for the team. They were controlled by players\
      \ that were either Techs or had a rank of Commander. Replicators were immobile\
      \ and appeared to be much like computers. When used, players were given two\
      \ categories to choose from - Research and Production. All technologies had\
      \ to be researched before being able to produce anything. All operations take\
      \ an amount of time and energy (as a rule, better technology takes more time\
      \ and consequently more energy). Technologies have to be researched only a single\
      \ time before production can be started. Only one operation can be executed\
      \ at a time, so there's nearly infinite amount of possibilities of using the\
      \ Replicator.\n\nThe core of the gameplay, as in U2XMP, is to capture an amount\
      \ of [[Artifact]]s. But unlike U2XMP, artifacts could be placed absolutely anywhere\
      \ in the map, giving more possibilities for Level Designers. Artifacts could\
      \ be placed like in U2XMP - in the enemy base, or out in the environment. Each\
      \ of them could require different qualities to reach - one could be accessible\
      \ only by jumping over lava pits, the other would require you to go through\
      \ a room full of monsters from the single player game while the third could\
      \ require you to solve a puzzle or go through a maze. Generally the gametype\
      \ was highly customisable and thus let Level Designers have an almost unlimited\
      \ control over the gameplay.\n\nUnlike U2XMP, it was meant to be a pickup-based\
      \ gametype, but items don't respawn like in the single player campaign. Instead,\
      \ you have to use the Replicator to get the items you need. To make it less\
      \ annoying, you only have to get the weapons, and ammo comes in \"Ammo Packs\"\
      \ for individual player classes. Each player class could use a lot more weapons\
      \ than in U2XMP, although still had their own restrictions. For example, Rangers\
      \ were the only ones that could use the Sniper Rifle, while Gunners were the\
      \ only ones that could use the Grenade Launcher. Each class also had different\
      \ starting weapons (except the [[Dispersion Pistol]], which was available for\
      \ everyone).\n\nJet packs were also not a part of the energy suits of players.\
      \ Instead, they had to be researched and produced with Replicators as all other\
      \ items. That's why [[Field Generator]]s were useful - you can't just jump over\
      \ them if you don't have a Jet Pack.\n\nReplicators could also produce all kinds\
      \ of things, ranging from deployables to vehicles to security cameras and security\
      \ bots. There were also research-only options, for example, Manned Turrets.\
      \ Level Designers could also configure what teams are allowed to build and what\
      \ not. All production went to special Level Designer marked storage rooms to\
      \ make it more realistic.\n\nIt might sound as if it required a large team of\
      \ players to make the gametype playable. But bot support was available and already\
      \ in Unreal II, and even if bots were disabled, a one-on-one match was possible,\
      \ without even restricting players to the Tech class. If there is only one player\
      \ in a team, he automatically becomes the Commander. Commanders have no pickup\
      \ restrictions and can operate Replicators even if their class is not Tech.\
      \ Replicators were also meant to have queues, so the player can select what\
      \ he wants to get and let the Replicator work for him. And even if it wasn't\
      \ operated, it would automatically research and build what it thinks would be\
      \ useful for the team.\n\nThe gametype was never complete due to the lack of\
      \ time. The project was ambitious, and Legend Entertainment simply didn't have\
      \ enough time to complete the gametype. A lot of alpha-state code is still in\
      \ Unreal II, though, and it allowed us to find out most of facts about the original\
      \ XMP that we see in this article. The gametype was never attempted to be remade\
      \ to the original form (U2XMP was made in a hurry and was simplified for a small\
      \ team with only a few months of time to complete the task) mostly because not\
      \ many people knew of the gametype.\n\n==Technologies==\nVarious graphics, gameplay\
      \ and sound technologies were cut from the game.\n\n===MP3 technology===\n{{quote|We\
