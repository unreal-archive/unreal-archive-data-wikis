      \ Wanna take a look? Or, how 'bout we brush up on your other weapons.<br />\n\
      <p>Dalton: Let's have a look.<br />\nIsaak: The M406 Grenade Launcher has slots\
      \ for six different grenade types. Tapping your primary fire lobs out a grenade\
      \ that explodes on contact. Holding the trigger a little longer engages the\
      \ timing mechanism, so you can bounce 'em around some. Secondary fire chambers\
      \ the next grenade type, if you've got any. If ya like, I can tell you about\

      \ />\nIsaak: The T-13 popgun is yer standard law enforcement sidearm. Doesn't\
      \ need ammo - recharges from a quantum pack in the handle. Primary fire is a\
      \ slow-moving energy pulse. Alt-Fire charges up a stronger pulse until you release\
      \ it. A dependable fall-back weapon, but not much use in a crowd.<br />\nDalton:\
      \ Lemme see the CAR.<br />\nIsaak: The M32 Duster fires depleted uranium shards\
      \ that don't have shells, but build up a nasty dust that gets ejected between\
      \ clips. Primary fire spits out rounds at a very high automatic rate. Alt-Fire\
      \ is a cluster of five shards packed together to form a single, slower-moving\
      \ slug. The slug breaks apart when it hits a wall, so if you're good, you can\
      \ even shoot around corners. Very effective overall - you can hose down an area\
      \ with primary fire, or deliver a single lethal punch with the alt-fire.<br\
      \ />\nDalton: Tell me about the frag grenade.<br />\nIsaak: Enormous explosive\

      \ some battles. Before going outside, collect the clips. When you go outside,\
      \ you will be immediately ambushed by Izarians on top of the hills sniping and\
      \ a Skaarj in front. Deal with the Skaarj first (you can take it out with a\
      \ single alt fire punch while it groans), then take out Izarians one by one\
      \ (snipe with alt fire). If you need more ammo, you can jump into the pool there\
      \ (the water is safe) for 3 CAR clips and one Combat Assault Rifle. Come out\
      \ and prepare to meet more Skaarj just as you cross the bridge there. One Medium\
      \ Skaarj is sneaking to the left, while another one is walking to the right.\
      \ They have huge Razik and tend to jump on you, so you are probably better with\
      \ using the Grenade Launcher for the one nearby, and a combo of primary and\
      \ alt fire for the one further. After both are dead, take the Health Pickup\
      \ to the right of the bridge and touch the dead Skaarj for getting back shield\
      \ energy. Now to the left there is a light Skaarj guarding a dead miner with\
      \ a CAR and a CAR clip, and there is one more just to the right of that Skaarj.\
      \ Again, don't use the primary CAR fire as it will be blocked. After that, you\
      \ might want to return to the pool and take the ammo you left (or even back\
      \ to the building if you didn't pick up both clips). The water in the pipe area\
      \ reveals nothing of interest, so don't fall in. Once you get to the camera,\
      \ Miller will think it's all over, and a \"dialogue\" will commence:\n</p>\n\

      \ you exit, jump over the fence and climb onto a piece of the generator that\
      \ goes further than the surrounding cylinder. Here comes agility training. You\
      \ have to get to the bottom without taking falling damage or getting burned\
      \ by the beams. They are moving to make things even more difficult. You have\
      \ to jump on the beam generator things while they are extended, and then jump\
      \ down as they come back. If you fail, you will fall and take some damage. It's\
      \ not much, but it's more interesting to climb down step by step. Remember,\
      \ unlike in other Unreal series games, you do fall down when crouching. Once\
      \ you're down there, go to the corpse of Danny Miller (don't worry, the Skaarj\
      \ isn't here... yet).\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\"\

      \ The M406 Grenade Launcher has slots for six different grenade types. Tapping\

      \ not much use in a crowd.<br/>\nDalton: Lemme see the CAR.<br/>\nIsaak: The\
      \ M32 Duster fires depleted uranium shards that don't have shells, but build\

      \ cause of the distress call''. This area is a good place to see what weapons\
      \ you have. The Combat Assault Rifle here is a great weapon that you will use\
      \ throughout this and later levels. The best thing is that it's almost fully\
      \ loaded! 500 bullets will be more than enough to pass the level. Now, take\
      \ out the [[Dispersion Pistol]] and play with it (we've got plenty of time because\
      \ the Unreal II episode is quite short). Try killing all cockroaches you find.\
      \ Then try to mantle on top of the TSL crate you see here (you might even mantle\
      \ on top of the Shock Lance there too!). Remember: mantling is a great way to\
      \ get good stuff. Many weapons and ammo are placed on top of crates. This crate,\
      \ though, reveals nothing interesting. The last weapon you have is the [[Grenade\
      \ Launcher]]. It has only frag grenades, and only 5. But remember that they\
      \ are extremely good and hit 200 points of damage. \n\nTake out your CAR and\

      \ a pack of Frag Grendades! Take them (you now have 10) and push the button.\
      \ The door opens, and you see the miner being tortured by Izarians on the opposite\

      \ dead, and there is no way you can help him. Now prepare to face your first\
      \ enemy... Turn right and go forward until you see two walkways meet, then continue.\
      \ You might alt fire your CAR forward hit the Izarian that runs though here.\
      \ I never managed to do that myself though. If you hit the fire extinguishers\

      \ Do that when the enemy is near one! Now reload your CAR (R key), and go right.\
      \ You will see a miner being killed by an Izarian. Now the action starts! The\
      \ Izarians will see you and hop through ventilation shafts at the top to kill\
      \ you! You can kill an Izarian with a direct Alt-Fire shot of the CAR. It hits\
      \ way more than the primary fire, so use it instead of the primary. Be careful\
      \ not to pick up the Izarian weapons! If you happen to do so, quickly change\
      \ back to the Combat Assault Rifle! Don't worry about the bouncy Shock Bolts,\
      \ they do almost no damage. Kill all of the Izarians and only then take all\
      \ the Shock Lances. Danny Miller will now start talking: \n{{QuoteSource|...get\

      \ tell you about what's waiting here:\n{{QuoteSource|Careful - a lot of that\
      \ stuff is unstable. A straight shot might set it off.|Danny Miller|Danny Miller}}\n\
      Remember what I've said about the fire extinguishers? Use that knowledge to\
      \ fry some Izarians and don't get yourself into the flames. There are two hiding\
      \ past the crates just in front. Kill them, then go forward. You'll be ambushed\
      \ just as you go half way from one set of crates to another. Watch your back!\
      \ There are some Izarians there too. So before you go there, reload and prepare.\
      \ There will be around 4 Izarins in front and 4 more behind. After you're done\
      \ dealing with them, take a health pickup if needed and go past the crates.\
      \ You'll see three CAR clips, each having 70 bullets. Take them to restock your\
      \ ammo. Now go through the door, but don't go too far away. Drown down into\
      \ the water to the left or right, then swim under the platform to find 2 packs\
      \ of extra Frag Grenades. Take them if you need, and mantle up the platform\
      \ again. Your screen darkens out and the level ends.\n\n===Sanctuary - Mining\
      \ Complex===\nYou start where you left the last time. The grenades aren't there\
      \ now, so don't even check. Go through the door to the outside area. Danny Miller\
      \ reports:\n\n[[Image:U2_M08_mission4.png|right|thumb|200px|An Izarian breaking\

      \ Miller}}\nYou'll soon see why Miller didn't see any of those creatures...\
      \ That's because they're on the roof. And they soon damage the camera. Now,\
      \ use your CAR to kill any Izarians you see on top of that structure. They will\
      \ jump down soon, so be careful. To the right you will soon see a Health Pickup.\
      \ When you advance further, you will see another Health Pickup just on the way.\
      \ Don't jump into the slime pool too. The barrels that are marked with a flame\
      \ icon are explosive - don't kill yourself. When you're done, you'll see that\
      \ the doors out of this area are broken. The lower section open and closes.\
      \ So, crouch, wait for it to start going down, and then crouch in. You shouldn't\
      \ be crushed. Now, Danny Miller sees you on the cameras and say:\n{{QuoteSource|Whew!\

      The doors here are your friends. Open the door, shoot what you can see with\
      \ the CAR primary fire, wait for them to close, reload, repeat. If after that\
      \ you'll need another health pickup, you can find it on the crate just to the\
      \ right from the door. Danny Miller doesn't help when he says \"Over there!\"\
      , but when he will say \"Man, I hope I never get YOU angry!\", there will be\
      \ no Izarians left. The drainage room has nothing interesting. Try to go through\
      \ the door and Miller will remember something:\n{{QuoteSource|Oh right, the\
      \ security door! Hold on, I'll open it up. There we go.|Danny Miller|Danny Miller}}\n\
      The doors open, and you can go through. Inside, there are loads of goodies you\
      \ need! Two CAR clips holding 70 bullets and one Energy Pickup which you will\
      \ surely need around now. Miller reports again:\n{{QuoteSource|I'm real worried\
      \ about the next stretch. None of the cameras work, so I can't see if anything's\

      \ elevator bursts into flames!]]\n\nHe's right. There is something bad in there.\
      \ But go in for now. The button is marked as \"Elevator_door\". This elevator\
      \ is made especially for you... Get out your Grenade Launcher. After you click\
      \ the button, a scene inspired by [[Unreal]]'s [[Rrajigar Mine]] will commence.\
      \ Relax and watch the show. The elevator will stop, and the lights will go off\
      \ one by one. Your eyes will get used to the dark and you will see a [[Skaarj]]\
      \ jumping down on your cabin. He will try to break in, and will cut off the\
      \ cables that hold your cabin. You will start falling down! The brakes work\
      \ good here, though, and you won't die from falling damage. As soon as you land,\
      \ get out of the elevator! Then throw in a Frag Grenade and if it hits the Skaarj,\
      \ you got an easy frag. It usually doesn't, though. In that case, either try\
      \ to hit him with the Grenade Launcher or get out your trusty CAR. Don't use\
      \ the alt fire though, as the Skaarj have [[Razik]] that reflects projectiles\
      \ - as your primary fire is [[hitscan]], there's no need to worry about that.\
      \ After the fight, you ask Aida:\n{{Quote|Dalton: Argh! Hey Aida, does your\
      \ guidebook list this as a vacation spot for Skaarj?<br/>\nAida: He's probably\
      \ checking up on his Izarian grunts. I don't like this, John.|John Dalton and\
      \ Aida}}\nNothing interesting in this area too. Go forward and press the button.\
      \ The door is blocked! Go back and you will see a small lift. Take it and ride\
      \ up. Open the door and go behind the stairs for an Energy and a Health Pickups.\
      \ Go back up, where Miller will see you:\n{{QuoteSource|So...? Nothing happened,\
      \ right? That's a relief. Guess I was worried for nothing.|Danny Miller|Danny\
      \ Miller}}\nYou can shoot at the camera to express annoyance.\n\nNow, prepare\
      \ your car and open the door. You will see another Skaarj - which you can take\
      \ out with a single well-placed alt-fire shot (be careful though, remember that\
      \ it can reflect projectiles). If you kill the Skaarj near the pool, you can\
      \ see some nice ragdoll effects. Now look around this eye-pleasing area. Inside\
      \ a round object (looks like a huge tyre) you can find an Assault Rifle clip,\
      \ and just to the left of the next doors - another one. You can also mantle\
      \ up the wall near the pool, walk the trampoline and jump into the water! Now\
      \ jump out and go through the door. But not far enough! Wait for the door to\
      \ close and click the hidden \"Item\" button behind the doors. No idea what\
      \ it does though, so you might as well go further and out of this map.\n\n===Sanctuary\

      \ mysteriously changed! Ah well, just a minor mistake. Take out your CAR and\

      \ see a dead miner with 2 CAR clips and hear Danny Miller talking.\n{{QuoteSource|The\

      \ Miller}}\n\n[[Image:U2_M08_mission6.png|right|thumb|200px|Outdoors]]\n\nYou\
      \ already noticed how hard it gets when Miller doesn't see you... So expect\
      \ some battles. Before going outside, collect the clips. When you go outside,\
      \ you will be immediately ambushed by Izarians on top of the hills sniping and\
      \ a Skaarj in front. Deal with the Skaarj first (you can take it out with a\
      \ single alt fire punch while it groans), then take out Izarians one by one\
      \ (snipe with alt fire). If you need more ammo, you can jump into the pool there\
      \ (the water is safe) for 3 CAR clips and one Combat Assault Rifle. Come out\
      \ and prepare to meet more Skaarj just as you cross the bridge there. One Medium\
      \ Skaarj is sneaking to the left, while another one is walking to the right.\
      \ They have huge Razik and tend to jump on you, so you are probably better with\
      \ using the Grenade Launcher for the one nearby, and a combo of primary and\
      \ alt fire for the one further. After both are dead, take the Health Pickup\
      \ to the right of the bridge and touch the dead Skaarj for getting back shield\
      \ energy. Now to the left there is a light Skaarj guarding a dead miner with\
      \ a CAR and a CAR clip, and there is one more just to the right of that Skaarj.\
      \ Again, don't use the primary CAR fire as it will be blocked. After that, you\
      \ might want to return to the pool and take the ammo you left (or even back\
      \ to the building if you didn't pick up both clips). The water in the pipe area\
      \ reveals nothing of interest, so don't fall in. Once you get to the camera,\
      \ Miller will think it's all over, and a \"dialogue\" will commence:\n{{Quote|Miller:\
      \ You made it! Woohoo! I'm right around the corner. Be right out!<br/>\nDalton:\
      \ No! It's not safe. I haven't cleared the area yet! Damn kid's going to get\
      \ himself killed.|Danny Miller and John Dalton}}\nJust after these words, a\
      \ cutscene will be shown. Danny Miller gets out of the building, and gets into\
      \ the hands of an Izarian. A heavy Skaarj, probably their general, comes out\
      \ and goes through the Izarian. He tries to hit Miller, but the miner accidentally\
      \ jumps down the generator shaft. An announcer will say: ''Obstruction detected,\
      \ emergency shutdown in 3... 2... 1...'', and as the generator closes, the Skaarj\
      \ will decide that he needs that thing too much and jumps in. The cutscene ends,\
      \ and your HUD shows ''Objective failed''. Now Aida starts a dialogue:\n{{Quote|Aida:\
      \ Pull out!<br/>\nDalton: Negative!<br/>\nAida: Your job's done. Fighting Skaarj\
      \ isn't in the mission profile.<br/>\nDalton: That kid just died to keep the\
      \ artifact from the Skaarj. You think I'm gonna just walk away? Get me down\
      \ there!<br/>\nAida: Forget it!<br/>\nDalton: I'm going, whether you help me\
      \ or not.<br/>\nAida: Damn! ...go to the control room and power up the generator.\
      \ And you'd better hope they kill you. Because if they don't, I will.|Aida and\
      \ John Dalton}}\n\n[[Image:U2_M08_mission7.png|right|thumb|200px|The laughing\
      \ Skaarj]]\n\nYou'll get a new objective. Now climb up the stairs near the camera\
      \ and follow the walkway to an emergency hatch. Open it and kill an Izarian\
      \ inside. Jump in and you'll find a Grenade Launcher, a CAR clip and a health\
      \ pickup. Take what you need and open the door. You will appear in another walkway\
      \ near the generator. Follow it, through an automatic door, through an empty\
      \ corridor, through another automatic door. There's an Izarian on the left side\
      \ attached to the ceiling. Kill it and operate the lift (once you're inside\
      \ it). Now you're probably wondering where are all the enemies. They will be\
      \ here soon. Go forward and a light Skaarj will break the window here. If you're\
      \ quick, you can shoot it before he starts doing anything. Go forward, and you'll\
      \ see a closed door with a Skaarj inside killing a miner. After it does that,\
      \ it will laugh at you and drown down. Now find a hole opposite the door, take\
      \ the CAR and a CAR clip on the way and alt fire at the Skaarj for an easy kill\
      \ (he has nowhere to hide or dodge here). Now this part is tricky. Crouch under\
      \ the raised platform here and go towards the grate floor you see. Mantle through\
      \ the side of the platform and kill the light Skaarj here. He will probably\
      \ have some time to dodge, so you'll be somewhat damaged then. Now you will\
      \ get an ''Objective Complete'' message. Take the CAR, CAR clip and an Energy\
      \ Pickup from the table, then go near the place you jumped out and take the\
      \ health pickup there. You will notice a Emergency Override trigger here, press\
      \ it and do the same with another one near it. Now a hologram of the generator\
      \ will appear on the table here. The announcer will say: ''Main terminal online.\
      \ Foreign object detected in generator. Analyzing... Alien lifeform detected\
      \ in generator. To terminate shutdown and restart generator, press override\
      \ button.'' A picture of the Heavy Skaarj and a button will appear. Press the\
      \ button. The announcer reports: ''Startup sequence engaged. Retracting shield.\
      \ Generator now online.''\n\nYou will be shown the generator opening, and you'll\
      \ get a new objective. Now Aida will say:\n{{QuoteSource|If you're going down\
      \ there, be careful. I decryped a Skaarj intercept that says they want that\
      \ thing pretty bad.|Aida|Aida}}\nThe door button is now available. Go through\
      \ these and another doors. Now this area is full of Izarians. Kill the one on\
      \ the crate, and try to take out the one behind without going inside the hallway.\
      \ If the doors close, open them again and kill the Izarian. Go in and there\
      \ is yet another one hiding behind a crate. Kill it and ride the lift back down.\
      \ This area is still clean. Go thorough 2 doors and exit the building. Now you\
      \ will see the generator. Just after you exit, jump over the fence and climb\
      \ onto a piece of the generator that goes further than the surrounding cylinder.\
      \ Here comes agility training. You have to get to the bottom without taking\
      \ falling damage or getting burned by the beams. They are moving to make things\
      \ even more difficult. You have to jump on the beam generator things while they\
      \ are extended, and then jump down as they come back. If you fail, you will\
      \ fall and take some damage. It's not much, but it's more interesting to climb\
      \ down step by step. Remember, unlike in other Unreal series games, you do fall\
      \ down when crouching. Once you're down there, go to the corpse of Danny Miller\
      \ (don't worry, the Skaarj isn't here... yet).\n\n[[Image:U2_M08_mission8.png|right|thumb|200px|The\

      \ foe you will face in this level... And the last one. Get out your Grenade\
      \ Launcher and frag the Skaarj with three or four grenades, as this Skaarj,\
      \ unlike the other ones, isn't agile at all and won't dodge off your grenades.\
      \ If you're quick, the Skaarj won't even start firing. If he does, avoid the\
      \ big red projectiles as they are very lethal. Take the energy he left in his\

      \ ''I've got the artifact!'' will be used in [[XMP]] matches... But for now,\
