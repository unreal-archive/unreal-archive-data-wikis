      \ <a href=\"/NEG\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"NEG\">NEG</a> forces. The New\
      \ Earth Government discovered that the Liandri were transferring experimental\
      \ weapons data through the facility, and sent an elite squad in to retrieve\
      \ the research. This squad must first make their way inside the compound (with\
      \ or without the use of a Hellbender). There they must open the vault, steal\
      \ the Data Stick and carry it outside, where they will have another Hellbender\
      \ to get the Stick to the computer terminal to transmit the weapon data to the\
      \ NEG.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Objectives\">Objectives</span><span\

      \ the Main Gate</dt>\n<dd> The attacking team starts a short distance from the\
      \ compound with a small weapon loadout and a <a href=\"/Hellbender\" title=\"\
      Hellbender\">Hellbender</a>. They must walk/drive down a short grassy road to\
      \ the compund's Main Gate. Useful tactics include setting up a chain with the\
      \ <a href=\"/Link_Gun\" title=\"Link Gun\">Link Gun</a>'s alt-fire (which can\
      \ also be used to repair the Hellbender) could make this objective easier to\

      >Rocket Launchers</a> from fragged defenders.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending\
      \ team spawns next to the door. They will have the better weapons, as well as\
      \ an <a href=\"/AVRiL\" title=\"AVRiL\">AVRiL</a> to fight the Hellbender and\
      \ a <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"Turrets\">Minigun Turret</a>\
      \ on a platform on the grassy road. A jumppad kicks the defenders to this platform\
      \ instantly. Although this turret is very effective against footsoldiers, it's\
      \ also very weak against the Hellbender. The vehicle won't have a lot of trouble\
      \ destroying the Minigun Turret, which then won't respawn.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy\
      \ the Front Door Controls</dt>\n<dd> With the Main Gate destroyed 2 hatches\
      \ will open next to the gate with Weapon Lockers and a very useful <a href=\"\
      /UDamage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UDamage\">UDamage</a> pickup. There's\
      \ a courtyard behind the destroyed Main Gate with 2 <a href=\"/Health#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Health\">Health Packs</a> in between the large pillars. The Door Controls\
      \ are on the left and right side of a small building in the back wall. Attackers\
      \ can use the large pillars for cover until they have reached either one of\
      \ the controls, where a few defenders will be waiting. 7 Rockets will destroy\
      \ a Control, and destroying both Controls will open the door.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\
      \ After the attackers completed the first objective the defending team will\
      \ respawn inside the building (after dying), close to the Controls. There are\
      \ 2 Minigun Turrets to use (1 near each of the controls) which overlook most\
      \ of the courtyard, but not the controls itself. Its view is also partially\
      \ obstructed by the large pillars, making them less effective. There's also\
      \ a <a href=\"/Armor#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\" title=\"Armor\">Shield\
      \ pack</a> and 2 sets of 4 <a href=\"/Health#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Health\">Health Vials</a> inside the building for the defenders to\
      \ use, though it takes a few seconds to reach them.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Get the\
      \ Keys from the Central Office</dt>\n<dd> Another set of hatches with weapon\
      \ lockers open as the Front Doors open. The main hall features a large statue\
      \ and 2 stairs. The Shield Pack and 8 Health Vials will be available for the\
      \ attackers at the foot of the statue, if the defenders haven't already snatched\
      \ them during the previous objective. The 2 stairs lead to a short hallway with\
      \ a large obstruction down the hall. The \"Central Office\" is just behind the\
      \ obstruction. The objective's status bar takes 4 seconds to empty.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The defending team respawns a bit to the back of the building, not\
      \ too far from the objective, but quite a walk from the Front Door. There's\
      \ not much the team can do but to take positions as fast as possible and wait\
      \ for the attackers. The only valuable item they could hope to obtain is the\
      \ Shield Pack near the entranc. The key to a successful defense here is tactical\
      \ positioning.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Use the Keys to open the Vault</dt>\n<dd>\
      \ There are now 4 more Shield Packs and 2 Weapon Lockers in the main hall for\
      \ the attackers to use. Beyond the Central Office, a turn to the left and a\
      \ small slope later the attackers will arrive in the room with the objective.\
      \ There are 2 Locks: 1 on the left and 1 on the right. A 4-second long presence\
      \ of an attacker will unlock a lock. Extra health and armor can be found in\
      \ the back of the room.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> These pickups are for the defending\
      \ team to use. They conveniently respawn near these pickups, above the Lock\
      \ room. They will reach the Shield Packs simply by jumping down. However, since\
      \ both teams have plenty of Shield Packs, this gives neither team an advantage.\
      \ What the defending team does have (and the attackers don't) is Health Packs.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Destroy the Data Shield</dt>\n<dd> 2 more hatches open in the Lock Room\
      \ with more Weapon Lockers. After a few seconds the Vault will be opened and\
      \ the attackers can move on to destroy the Data Shield. This Shield is in the\
      \ back of the large column in the middle of the large room up ahead. The defending\
      \ team will not be teleported away, so a cluttered-up fight in front of the\
      \ slowly-opening Vault Door is almost inevitable. There are no extra weapons\
      \ or pickups in the Vault to help either team. 20 rockets will destroy the Shield\
      \ and allow the attackers to complete the next objective.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\
      \ The defenders' spawnpoints are a small walk away from the Vault. That, in\
      \ combination with the limited weapon loadout, puts respawning defenders at\
      \ an disadvantage. Because of this it would be very wise to stock up on Shield\
      \ Packs just before the previous objective is over. The attackers will open\
      \ the vault quicker this way, but they may take a lot longer to destroy the\
      \ Data Shield with a team or well-armoured defenders defending it.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Get the Data Stick!</dt>\n<dd> With the Shield destroyed the Data Stick\
      \ can now be picked up by an attacker. When one of the attackers walks over\
      \ the Stick, the objective is completed. Much like in Capture The Flag, the\
      \ Stick will be dropped when the carrier is fragged. Another attacker can simply\
      \ pick it up again from where the carrier dropped the Stick and continue to\
      \ complete the next objective.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Realign the Antenna</dt>\n\
      <dd> Now it's time to make a run with the Data Stick. There's another Hellbender\
      \ waiting outside, next to the door, as well as a new Weapon Locker. There are\
      \ 2 slopes on the right side. The leftmost road is quicker, but guarded by Minigun\
      \ Turret on a platform (on the left of the road). The objective is on this same\
      \ platform, but the attackers will have to walk around it to be able to get\
      \ on it. The other path (which goes up) avoids most of that and leads straight\
      \ to the objective, via a small detour over a slightly-narrow bridge. When the\
      \ carrier reaches the marked area on the platform the objective is reached.\
      \  </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The only person who can complete the objective is the\
      \ carrier of the Data Stick. When the carrier is in the Hellbender the Data\
      \ Stick can be seen sticking out of its Skymine turret. FOr the first time the\
      \ defending team will teleport to the Computer Terminal. A set of jumppads will\
      \ kick them to either the bridge or the platform with the objective (depending\
      \ on which side of the terminal the defender spawned). Also, make sure not to\
      \ get too close to the attacker's spawnpoints to avoid its <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Sentinel's</a> fire.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Get the Data Stick!</dt>\n\
      <dd> The Data Stick is now magically teleported to the bridge where it can be\
      \ picked up again. Attackers coming from the spawnpoints need to take the rightmost\
      \ slope (the one leading up) to get to this bridge quickly. Like the first time:\
      \ Walking over the Data Stick will make the attacker in question pick it up\
      \ and complete this objective.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> This is where the attackers\
      \ can really rush their offense. Having an extra attacker stationary near the\
      \ location of the stick while the carrier reaches the platform will shave seconds\
      \ off of their time. Therefor the defending team would be wise to keep an eye\
      \ on this section at all times and/or send a defender in to prepare for/ambush\
      \ the attackers on the bridge. The Bio-Rifle's alt-fire can be particularly\
      \ useful on this narrow bridge.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Upload Data Stick at the\
      \ Computer Terminal</dt>\n<dd> Now it is time to complete the mission and transfer\
      \ the information from the Data Stick. This must be done in the building on\
      \ the other side of the bridge. From the Antenna (where the Data Stick was)\
      \ the attacker must jump over the side of the bridge (the side with the Antenna)\
      \ and make a straight run for the large entrance of the Computer Terminal. Look\
      \ out for the 2 Minigun Turrets on this building, which overlook roughly 90%\
      \ of this route. Once the carrier made it to the computer at the back of the\
      \ hall the mission is completed.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> A successful defense here\
      \ is based on preparation. The defenders will not be teleported for this objective,\
      \ so they may end up trying to catch up to the carrier if their preparation\
      \ was lacking. Suiciding could be used as a way to get the defenders close to\
      \ the Minigun Turrets and the objective faster. The combination of 2 Minigun\
      \ Turrets and footsoldiers wielding Flak Cannons should stall the carrier. The\
      \ small slopes near the back of the room also make good ambush points, where\
      \ the Bio-Rifle could come in handy. </dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ Turrets are no match for the Hellbender. A good strategy is to let the Hellbender\
      \ destroy these turrets and have a few attackers with Link Guns protect/repair\
      \ the Hellbender. With the Minigun Turrets gone, footsoldiers will have a much\
      \ easier time progressing through the level. The Hellbender can also destroy\
      \ the turrets in the courtyard from a distance, even though the entrance to\
      \ the area is mostly blocked. Inside the compound plenty of pickups and weapons\
      \ can be found after objectives have been completed. The extra armor or UDamage\
      \ might be worth the trip back to the first part of the level. The final 3 objectives\
      \ is where most of the time can be saved using good teamwork. Having an attacker\
      \ ready on the bridge to take the Data Stick, while another attacker is standing\
      \ by in a Hellbender to transport him to the Computer Terminal fast, while the\
      \ carrier of the first Stick reaches the 3rd-last objective could result in\
      \ a very quick time and victory in the match.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Defensive</dt>\n\
      <dd> There are only a few parts in this level where the defenders have an advantage\
      \ over the attackers. The AVRiL for the first objective, the Shield Pack for\
      \ the 2nd and the occasional Minigun Turret is all what the defenders have in\
      \ this aspect. In some parts of the level both teams will be racing to the same\
      \ objective. In these cases it may be wise to press Q (by default) to teleport\
      \ to the newly enabled spawnpoints instantly. This prevents the scenario where\
      \ the defenders are running after the attackers, trying to catch up. This also\
      \ gives defenders the time to load up the Bio-Rifles alt-fire and wait for the\

      \ Description==\nThis scenario recreates the invasion of the Central [[Liandri]]\
      \ Information compound by [[NEG]] forces. The New Earth Government discovered\
      \ that the Liandri were transferring experimental weapons data through the facility,\
      \ and sent an elite squad in to retrieve the research. This squad must first\
      \ make their way inside the compound (with or without the use of a Hellbender).\
      \ There they must open the vault, steal the Data Stick and carry it outside,\
      \ where they will have another Hellbender to get the Stick to the computer terminal\
      \ to transmit the weapon data to the NEG.\n\n==Objectives==\n;Destroy the Main\
      \ Gate\n: The attacking team starts a short distance from the compound with\
      \ a small weapon loadout and a [[Hellbender]]. They must walk/drive down a short\
      \ grassy road to the compund's Main Gate. Useful tactics include setting up\
      \ a chain with the [[Link Gun]]'s alt-fire (which can also be used to repair\
      \ the Hellbender) could make this objective easier to reach, as well as snatching\
      \ [[Rocket Launcher]]s from fragged defenders.\n\n: The defending team spawns\
      \ next to the door. They will have the better weapons, as well as an [[AVRiL]]\
      \ to fight the Hellbender and a [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Minigun Turret]]\
      \ on a platform on the grassy road. A jumppad kicks the defenders to this platform\
      \ instantly. Although this turret is very effective against footsoldiers, it's\
      \ also very weak against the Hellbender. The vehicle won't have a lot of trouble\
      \ destroying the Minigun Turret, which then won't respawn.\n\n;Destroy the Front\
      \ Door Controls\n: With the Main Gate destroyed 2 hatches will open next to\
      \ the gate with Weapon Lockers and a very useful [[UDamage]] pickup. There's\
      \ a courtyard behind the destroyed Main Gate with 2 [[Health#Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003 and 2004|Health Packs]] in between the large pillars. The Door Controls\
      \ are on the left and right side of a small building in the back wall. Attackers\
      \ can use the large pillars for cover until they have reached either one of\
      \ the controls, where a few defenders will be waiting. 7 Rockets will destroy\
      \ a Control, and destroying both Controls will open the door.\n\n: After the\
      \ attackers completed the first objective the defending team will respawn inside\
      \ the building (after dying), close to the Controls. There are 2 Minigun Turrets\
      \ to use (1 near each of the controls) which overlook most of the courtyard,\
      \ but not the controls itself. Its view is also partially obstructed by the\
      \ large pillars, making them less effective. There's also a [[Armor#Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003 and 2004|Shield pack]] and 2 sets of 4 [[Health#Unreal Tournament 2003\
      \ and 2004|Health Vials]] inside the building for the defenders to use, though\
      \ it takes a few seconds to reach them.\n\n;Get the Keys from the Central Office\n\
      : Another set of hatches with weapon lockers open as the Front Doors open. The\
      \ main hall features a large statue and 2 stairs. The Shield Pack and 8 Health\
      \ Vials will be available for the attackers at the foot of the statue, if the\
      \ defenders haven't already snatched them during the previous objective. The\
      \ 2 stairs lead to a short hallway with a large obstruction down the hall. The\
      \ \"Central Office\" is just behind the obstruction. The objective's status\
      \ bar takes 4 seconds to empty.\n\n: The defending team respawns a bit to the\
      \ back of the building, not too far from the objective, but quite a walk from\
      \ the Front Door. There's not much the team can do but to take positions as\
      \ fast as possible and wait for the attackers. The only valuable item they could\
      \ hope to obtain is the Shield Pack near the entranc. The key to a successful\
      \ defense here is tactical positioning.\n\n;Use the Keys to open the Vault\n\
      : There are now 4 more Shield Packs and 2 Weapon Lockers in the main hall for\
      \ the attackers to use. Beyond the Central Office, a turn to the left and a\
      \ small slope later the attackers will arrive in the room with the objective.\
      \ There are 2 Locks: 1 on the left and 1 on the right. A 4-second long presence\
      \ of an attacker will unlock a lock. Extra health and armor can be found in\
      \ the back of the room.\n\n: These pickups are for the defending team to use.\
      \ They conveniently respawn near these pickups, above the Lock room. They will\
      \ reach the Shield Packs simply by jumping down. However, since both teams have\
      \ plenty of Shield Packs, this gives neither team an advantage. What the defending\
      \ team does have (and the attackers don't) is Health Packs.\n\n;Destroy the\
      \ Data Shield\n: 2 more hatches open in the Lock Room with more Weapon Lockers.\
      \ After a few seconds the Vault will be opened and the attackers can move on\
      \ to destroy the Data Shield. This Shield is in the back of the large column\
      \ in the middle of the large room up ahead. The defending team will not be teleported\
      \ away, so a cluttered-up fight in front of the slowly-opening Vault Door is\
      \ almost inevitable. There are no extra weapons or pickups in the Vault to help\
      \ either team. 20 rockets will destroy the Shield and allow the attackers to\
      \ complete the next objective.\n\n: The defenders' spawnpoints are a small walk\
      \ away from the Vault. That, in combination with the limited weapon loadout,\
      \ puts respawning defenders at an disadvantage. Because of this it would be\
      \ very wise to stock up on Shield Packs just before the previous objective is\
      \ over. The attackers will open the vault quicker this way, but they may take\
      \ a lot longer to destroy the Data Shield with a team or well-armoured defenders\
      \ defending it.\n\n;Get the Data Stick!\n: With the Shield destroyed the Data\
      \ Stick can now be picked up by an attacker. When one of the attackers walks\
      \ over the Stick, the objective is completed. Much like in Capture The Flag,\
      \ the Stick will be dropped when the carrier is fragged. Another attacker can\
      \ simply pick it up again from where the carrier dropped the Stick and continue\
      \ to complete the next objective.\n\n;Realign the Antenna\n: Now it's time to\
      \ make a run with the Data Stick. There's another Hellbender waiting outside,\
      \ next to the door, as well as a new Weapon Locker. There are 2 slopes on the\
      \ right side. The leftmost road is quicker, but guarded by Minigun Turret on\
      \ a platform (on the left of the road). The objective is on this same platform,\
      \ but the attackers will have to walk around it to be able to get on it. The\
      \ other path (which goes up) avoids most of that and leads straight to the objective,\
      \ via a small detour over a slightly-narrow bridge. When the carrier reaches\
      \ the marked area on the platform the objective is reached.  \n\n: The only\
      \ person who can complete the objective is the carrier of the Data Stick. When\
      \ the carrier is in the Hellbender the Data Stick can be seen sticking out of\
      \ its Skymine turret. FOr the first time the defending team will teleport to\
      \ the Computer Terminal. A set of jumppads will kick them to either the bridge\
      \ or the platform with the objective (depending on which side of the terminal\
      \ the defender spawned). Also, make sure not to get too close to the attacker's\
      \ spawnpoints to avoid its [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Sentinel's]] fire.\n\
      \n;Get the Data Stick!\n: The Data Stick is now magically teleported to the\
      \ bridge where it can be picked up again. Attackers coming from the spawnpoints\
      \ need to take the rightmost slope (the one leading up) to get to this bridge\
      \ quickly. Like the first time: Walking over the Data Stick will make the attacker\
      \ in question pick it up and complete this objective.\n\n: This is where the\
      \ attackers can really rush their offense. Having an extra attacker stationary\
      \ near the location of the stick while the carrier reaches the platform will\
      \ shave seconds off of their time. Therefor the defending team would be wise\
      \ to keep an eye on this section at all times and/or send a defender in to prepare\
      \ for/ambush the attackers on the bridge. The Bio-Rifle's alt-fire can be particularly\
      \ useful on this narrow bridge.\n\n;Upload Data Stick at the Computer Terminal\n\
      : Now it is time to complete the mission and transfer the information from the\
      \ Data Stick. This must be done in the building on the other side of the bridge.\
      \ From the Antenna (where the Data Stick was) the attacker must jump over the\
      \ side of the bridge (the side with the Antenna) and make a straight run for\
      \ the large entrance of the Computer Terminal. Look out for the 2 Minigun Turrets\
      \ on this building, which overlook roughly 90% of this route. Once the carrier\
      \ made it to the computer at the back of the hall the mission is completed.\n\
      \n: A successful defense here is based on preparation. The defenders will not\
      \ be teleported for this objective, so they may end up trying to catch up to\
      \ the carrier if their preparation was lacking. Suiciding could be used as a\
      \ way to get the defenders close to the Minigun Turrets and the objective faster.\
      \ The combination of 2 Minigun Turrets and footsoldiers wielding Flak Cannons\
      \ should stall the carrier. The small slopes near the back of the room also\
      \ make good ambush points, where the Bio-Rifle could come in handy. \n\n== Weapons\

      ** 6x Ceiling Sentinel\n** 5x Floor Sentinel\n\n== Tips & tricks ==\n;Offensive\n\
      : As mentioned before: Minigun Turrets are no match for the Hellbender. A good\
      \ strategy is to let the Hellbender destroy these turrets and have a few attackers\
      \ with Link Guns protect/repair the Hellbender. With the Minigun Turrets gone,\
      \ footsoldiers will have a much easier time progressing through the level. The\
      \ Hellbender can also destroy the turrets in the courtyard from a distance,\
      \ even though the entrance to the area is mostly blocked. Inside the compound\
      \ plenty of pickups and weapons can be found after objectives have been completed.\
      \ The extra armor or UDamage might be worth the trip back to the first part\
      \ of the level. The final 3 objectives is where most of the time can be saved\
      \ using good teamwork. Having an attacker ready on the bridge to take the Data\
      \ Stick, while another attacker is standing by in a Hellbender to transport\
      \ him to the Computer Terminal fast, while the carrier of the first Stick reaches\
      \ the 3rd-last objective could result in a very quick time and victory in the\
      \ match.\n\n;Defensive\n: There are only a few parts in this level where the\
      \ defenders have an advantage over the attackers. The AVRiL for the first objective,\
      \ the Shield Pack for the 2nd and the occasional Minigun Turret is all what\
      \ the defenders have in this aspect. In some parts of the level both teams will\
      \ be racing to the same objective. In these cases it may be wise to press Q\
      \ (by default) to teleport to the newly enabled spawnpoints instantly. This\
      \ prevents the scenario where the defenders are running after the attackers,\
      \ trying to catch up. This also gives defenders the time to load up the Bio-Rifles\
      \ alt-fire and wait for the attackers on a tactical position, for example.\n\
      \n==Trivia==\n* When the player goes to stand to the left of the pillar in the\
      \ courtyard that's the closest to the leftmost Door Control, the large cannon\
      \ on top of the building will rotate and shoot down an incoming dropship, which\
      \ will crash just outside of the courtyard, causing a huge explosion.\n* This\
      \ map was originally called \"Teh Demo\", and was an assault on Epic headquarters\
      \ to steal the Unreal Tournament 2050 demo and upload it to the internet.\n\
      * If you look really closely to the monitors in the central office, the text\
      \ on the monitors with the missile and Matrix blueprints show the Unreal Tournament\
