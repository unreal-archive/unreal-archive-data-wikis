    text: "<p>The term \"lockdown\" was coined for an effect which happens when a\

      \ Gun</a>. Players under the effect of a lockdown cannot dodge or jump, which\
      \ greatly reduces their chances to avoid being hit, which in turn keeps them\
      \ exposed to the the lockdown effect while constantly taking damage.\n</p>\n\

      \ lockdown effect was never intentionally added into the game. It is a side\
      \ effect from the way a player takes damage. In order to bounce players around\
      \ when rockets or other things explode next to them, the player's physics mode\
      \ is changed to \"falling\" whenever a hit with a set momentum value occurs.\
      \ Small amounts of momentum, like that of a single <a href=\"/Enforcer\" title=\"\
      Enforcer\">Enforcer</a> shot, will not cause any significant movement -- the\
      \ player lands on the ground again within a split second without noticing that\
      \ he actually lost contact with the ground.\n</p><p>In that short period where\
      \ the player doesn't touch the ground, he can, by definition, neither jump nor\
      \ dodge. Since technically you are in the air, you could perform a double jump\
      \ or, if near a wall, wall dodge in <a href=\"/UT2003\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"UT2003\">UT2003</a> and <a href=\"/UT2004\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"UT2004\">UT2004</a>. In <a href=\"/UT\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      UT\">UT</a> you are a sitting duck, though, since there are no mid-air moves.\
      \ If you are only hit once in a while, this effect will not be a problem since\
      \ it's very unlikely you are trying to jump or dodge right at the moment when\
      \ you are hit. With rapid-fire weapons, however, the time between the hits is\
      \ small enough to increase the chance for this effect to interfere with your\
      \ dodging or jumping attempts. A dodging move (i.e. both key presses) must be\
      \ performed entirely while on the ground, and there's a short delay after landing\
      \ where a dodge cannot be executed. The rate at which a Minigun or Link Gun\
      \ applies momentum to the player is high enough to constantly keep the player\
      \ in this post-landing delay or at least to interrupt the dodging input sequence\
      \ before the key is pressed a second time.\n</p><p>Even the UT2004 Lightning\
      \ Gun exhibits lockdown, though the effect is so minor you might not have ever\
      \ noticed.  Getting hit with it applies 1 point of momentum, but it's enough\
      \ to disrupt your movement -- particularly, it can stop a dodge just as it's\
      \ about to occur.  The UT2004 Shock Rifle also exhibits a form of lockdown,\
      \ which was eventually dubbed \"shock tape\" by the community.  The momentum\
      \ of the Shock Rifle is so great that often the player being hit by it doesn't\
      \ have time to move again before the next shot occurs.  This allows for a lockdown\
      \ effect even though the weapon is anything but rapid-fire.\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ UT200x, the Shield Gun is one of the best ways to avoid the effects of lockdown\
      \ long enough to mount some sort of counter.  Otherwise, the only thing you\
      \ can do is hope the other player misses, you can kill him before he gets you,\
      \ or you can maneuver somewhere to force a break of his lockdown.\n</p><p>In\
      \ code, a common approach to avoid the lockdown effect is to turn off the damage\
      \ momentum for rapid-fire weapons with a mutator. In UT2003 this is done by\
      \ the custom mutator TTM for the Minigun and the Link Gun. In UT2004 the Minigun's\
      \ and the Assault Rifle's momentum is disabled by default, but the Link Gun\
      \ still applies momentum and thus locks down players.\n</p><p>Technical detail:\
      \ In the first UT the lockdown happen because the addvelocity function of a\
      \ player contain some code that modify the physics of the player so when he\
      \ is walking he will go to physic state falling. This force the player on the\
      \ ground and appear to reset the z component of velocity. It will interrupt\
      \ the jump or dodge of a player. This appear to be independant of the momentum\
      \ value so if you set velocity and addvelocity to null vector the lockdown effect\
      \ will continue. To fix this problem the mutator utpure modify the addvelocity\
      \ function of a pawn so it will do nothing when lockdown is disabled.\n</p>\n\
