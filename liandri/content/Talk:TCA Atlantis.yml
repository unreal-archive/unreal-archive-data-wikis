      \ title=\"User:Sir Brizz\">Sir Brizz</a> 10:05, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n</p><p>I\
      \ thought about it for a while, but I still disagree. First of all, I see the\
      \ <a href=\"/Unreal_2:_The_Awakening#Single_Player\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Unreal 2: The Awakening\">current list of maps</a> does currently link to the\
      \ planet articles (and this ship one), but simply changing the links in that\
      \ list would take about 5 seconds per mission, so \"reserved\" doesn't really\
      \ mean much. Other articles do already link to the planet articles (in my head\
      \ they were reserved for the planets). I argue that that changing the list would\
      \ be a better course of action.\n</p><p>It would keep the planet articles neatly\
      \ named, without the bracketed \"planet\" or \"moon\" suffixes. (Those should\
      \ be lower case instead of upper, right?)\n</p><p>Personally if I was looking\
      \ for the planet, I'd definitely enter the word \"Sanctuary\". If I was looking\
      \ for the mission, I'd go through the Unreal 2 article and look for a list there.\
      \ Especially if I wasn't a hardcore fan who is only looking for \"that level\
      \ where you land in the jungle to rescue some dude\".&#160;:) Also, once reading\
      \ an article, I'd like to have a template a the bottom to view the other missions,\
      \ just like it is with Unreal and RTNP already. That makes the names for the\
      \ missions somewhat less important.\n</p><p>The missions in-game are also chapters,\
      \ so wouldn't it be a decent solution to name them like in the game, with the\
      \ chapter number in front? In my opinion that wouldn't lower the quality of\
      \ the articles, the wiki a as a whole, or anything.\n</p><p>Taken straight from\
      \ the game, the list goes:\n</p>\n<ol><li>Avalon</li>\n<li>Atlantis Interlude</li>\n\
      <li>Sanctuary</li>\n<li>Swamp</li>\n<li>Atlantis Interlude</li>\n<li>Hell</li>\n\
      <li>Atlantis Interlude</li>\n<li>Acheron</li></ol>\n<p>(I restarted on my new\
      \ computer, don't play everyday, so I didn't get the rest unlocked just yet.)\
      \ I say the Atlantis Interlude stuff is very important to the story, so it should\
      \ also get some articles. Like with the game, players looking for a walkthrough\
      \ can easily skip them. Of course maybe a single article is better (depending\
      \ on the size(s)), with numbered sections for the different chapters, and bookmarks\
      \ to those chapters in the template at the bottom.\n</p><p>OK, pretty long response,\
      \ but that's my view on how this could/should be done. Feel free to (dis)agree!&#160;:)\

      \ April 2008 (EDT)\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Quite a long one&#160;;) I support disambiguations.\
      \ Like, there should be an article on <a href=\"/Foundry\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Foundry\">Foundry</a> - the actual building, and an article <a href=\"\
      /Foundry_Tarydium_Plant\" title=\"Foundry Tarydium Plant\">Foundry Tarydium\
      \ Plant</a> that is a level walkthrough, both with disambiguations (if more\
      \ than one, then it would be good to make a disambiguation page).</dd></dl>\n\
      <p>That way, it wouldn't matter how they are named, as when you get to the page,\
      \ you can follow a link to the one you need. But in my opinion, planets should\
      \ have higher priority, like Retodon stated, if I entered Sanctuary I would\
      \ be looking for the planet. But I would look there for a link to the level\
      \ as well.\n</p><p>Yes, template. I'm thinking of creating one, that's not hard.\
      \ I have a good walkthrough resource as well.\n</p><p>With Interludes, I'd say\
      \ we should do the same as it's with Intermissions of RTNP - after each level,\
      \ a section describing the Atlantis Interlude should be added. --<a href=\"\

      \ Examples like <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"Manta\">Manta</a> (vehicle) and <a\
      \ href=\"/Manta_(enemy)\" title=\"Manta (enemy)\">Manta (enemy)</a> benefit\
      \ from a little DAB link at the top (using <a href=\"/Template:For\" title=\"\
      Template:For\">this template</a>). If there was also an Tournament contestant\
      \ named Manta, maybe something else still, a whole DAB page could be better\
      \ still. However, see Sir Brizz comment below. DAB pages are always disruptive\
      \ of the flow of a wiki, never something someone is actually looking for, so\
      \ if one of the subjects is likely to be the most popular, it should get the\
      \ \"nice\" name, with a DAB link at the top, pointing to the DAB page.</dd></dl></dd></dl>\n\

      <dl><dd><dl><dd>Putting interludes inside the mission articles is another option;\

      <hr />\n<p>Why would anyone ever come to the wiki looking for information on\
      \ a planet in the series? It is MUCH more likely that someone typing in Sanctuary\
      \ would be looking for information on either the UT3 map DM-Sanctuary or the\
      \ Unreal 2 level than the planet name. That's why it should have the main title.\
      \ I realize most of the names are not explicit in the game, but \"Sanctuary\"\
      \ as a keyword in Unreal 2 is a lot more forefront than a cursory mention on\
      \ a character description page somewhere in UT.\n</p>\n<dl><dd>Why? Because\
      \ some people are just Unreal nuts!&#160;:) I believe most people don't care\
      \ about story a whole lot; they just want to shoot stuff, but the fans that\
      \ care about the story shouldn't be dismissed either. Think about Fan fiction...\
      \ something which usually gives me shivers all over, which I try to avoid as\
      \ best as I can, but something which at least benefits my argument here.&#160;:)</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd>You say it is \"MUCH more likely\" that someone is looking for the UT3\
      \ map (oh yeah, that's another \"Sanctuary\"), but in reality none of us have\
      \ any hard numbers to back up our claims... unless of course you do.&#160;:)\
      \ I just know what I think, and I stated that in my previous post/edit. Actually\
      \ I didn't remember the UT3 map at the time I wrote that though, and now I believe\
      \ that is probably the most likely candidate for a user's search, more likely\
      \ than either the U2 planet or mission. <small>—Preceding unsigned comment added\

      \ I think a disambiguation page in this case is undeniable. I'm sure that the\
      \ UT3 map is the most likely candidate for searches, however it is also technically\
      \ DM-Sanctuary and you could again make the argument that someone would reach\
      \ it through the UT3 page before searching for it&#160;:) I don't know which\
      \ of the two is most appropriate, but I do know the planet information is absolutely\
      \ the LEAST likely information that someone is looking for when searching for\
      \ this. It is really not a case of the information being un-needed at all. I\
      \ just don't think it's likely that is what someone is searching for when they\
      \ type in the search terms. To me it would be like someone searching for Face\
      \ and having it take them to a page about the facial animation software rather\
      \ than a page about Face or the disambiguation page for Face. --<a href=\"/User:Sir_Brizz\"\

      \ bring up the most common result on the strict name and link to the disambiguation\

    text: "This page needs to be moved to TCA Atlantis (Ship) or something, as this\
      \ page is reserved for the Unreal 2 level TCA Atlantis. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir\
      \ Brizz]] 10:05, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n\nI thought about it for a while, but\
      \ I still disagree. First of all, I see the [[Unreal 2: The Awakening#Single\
      \ Player|current list of maps]] does currently link to the planet articles (and\
      \ this ship one), but simply changing the links in that list would take about\
      \ 5 seconds per mission, so \"reserved\" doesn't really mean much. Other articles\
      \ do already link to the planet articles (in my head they were reserved for\
      \ the planets). I argue that that changing the list would be a better course\
      \ of action.\n\nIt would keep the planet articles neatly named, without the\
      \ bracketed \"planet\" or \"moon\" suffixes. (Those should be lower case instead\
      \ of upper, right?)\n\nPersonally if I was looking for the planet, I'd definitely\
      \ enter the word \"Sanctuary\". If I was looking for the mission, I'd go through\
      \ the Unreal 2 article and look for a list there. Especially if I wasn't a hardcore\
      \ fan who is only looking for \"that level where you land in the jungle to rescue\
      \ some dude\". :) Also, once reading an article, I'd like to have a template\
      \ a the bottom to view the other missions, just like it is with Unreal and RTNP\
      \ already. That makes the names for the missions somewhat less important.\n\n\
      The missions in-game are also chapters, so wouldn't it be a decent solution\
      \ to name them like in the game, with the chapter number in front? In my opinion\
      \ that wouldn't lower the quality of the articles, the wiki a as a whole, or\
      \ anything.\n\nTaken straight from the game, the list goes:\n#Avalon\n#Atlantis\
      \ Interlude\n#Sanctuary\n#Swamp\n#Atlantis Interlude\n#Hell\n#Atlantis Interlude\n\
      #Acheron\n(I restarted on my new computer, don't play everyday, so I didn't\
      \ get the rest unlocked just yet.) I say the Atlantis Interlude stuff is very\
      \ important to the story, so it should also get some articles. Like with the\
      \ game, players looking for a walkthrough can easily skip them. Of course maybe\
      \ a single article is better (depending on the size(s)), with numbered sections\
      \ for the different chapters, and bookmarks to those chapters in the template\
      \ at the bottom.\n\nOK, pretty long response, but that's my view on how this\
      \ could/should be done. Feel free to (dis)agree! :) [[User:Retodon8|Retodon8]]\
      \ 14:04, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n:Quite a long one ;) I support disambiguations.\
      \ Like, there should be an article on [[Foundry]] - the actual building, and\
      \ an article [[Foundry Tarydium Plant]] that is a level walkthrough, both with\
      \ disambiguations (if more than one, then it would be good to make a disambiguation\
      \ page).\n\nThat way, it wouldn't matter how they are named, as when you get\
      \ to the page, you can follow a link to the one you need. But in my opinion,\
      \ planets should have higher priority, like Retodon stated, if I entered Sanctuary\
      \ I would be looking for the planet. But I would look there for a link to the\
      \ level as well.\n\nYes, template. I'm thinking of creating one, that's not\
      \ hard. I have a good walkthrough resource as well.\n\nWith Interludes, I'd\
      \ say we should do the same as it's with Intermissions of RTNP - after each\
      \ level, a section describing the Atlantis Interlude should be added. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 15:05, 18 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n::I basically agree about the DAB (disambiguation).\
      \ Examples like [[Manta]] (vehicle) and [[Manta (enemy)]] benefit from a little\
      \ DAB link at the top (using [[Template:For|this template]]). If there was also\
      \ an Tournament contestant named Manta, maybe something else still, a whole\
      \ DAB page could be better still. However, see Sir Brizz comment below. DAB\
      \ pages are always disruptive of the flow of a wiki, never something someone\
      \ is actually looking for, so if one of the subjects is likely to be the most\
      \ popular, it should get the \"nice\" name, with a DAB link at the top, pointing\
      \ to the DAB page.\n\n::A U2 single player template could be build of the [[Template:Unreal\
      \ Single Player|Unreal Single Player]] one... the code seems easy enough. We\
      \ should wait doing that until the right format for this is decided though.\n\
      \n::Putting interludes inside the mission articles is another option; I managed\
      \ to not even think of that. Wouldn't it be better to put them at the beginning\
      \ though, since they are mostly the intro to the next mission, rather than the\
      \ outro to the previous? Then again, the uninterested would have to always skip\
      \ the interlude part to get to the walkthrough... [[User:Retodon8|Retodon8]]\
      \ 17:27, 19 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n:::For RTNP, no, as for U2, I don't know...\
      \ Probably it would. But then to save scrolling time, there could be a link\
      \ at the top to the bottom, like ''To see the mission briefing on TCA Atlantis,\
      \ look here: Article#Atlantis Interlude''. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 18:21, 19 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n----\n\nWhy would anyone ever come to the wiki\
      \ looking for information on a planet in the series? It is MUCH more likely\
      \ that someone typing in Sanctuary would be looking for information on either\
      \ the UT3 map DM-Sanctuary or the Unreal 2 level than the planet name. That's\
      \ why it should have the main title. I realize most of the names are not explicit\
      \ in the game, but \"Sanctuary\" as a keyword in Unreal 2 is a lot more forefront\
      \ than a cursory mention on a character description page somewhere in UT.\n\n\
      :Why? Because some people are just Unreal nuts! :) I believe most people don't\
      \ care about story a whole lot; they just want to shoot stuff, but the fans\
      \ that care about the story shouldn't be dismissed either. Think about Fan fiction...\
      \ something which usually gives me shivers all over, which I try to avoid as\
      \ best as I can, but something which at least benefits my argument here. :)\n\
      \n:You say it is \"MUCH more likely\" that someone is looking for the UT3 map\
      \ (oh yeah, that's another \"Sanctuary\"), but in reality none of us have any\
      \ hard numbers to back up our claims... unless of course you do. :) I just know\
      \ what I think, and I stated that in my previous post/edit. Actually I didn't\
      \ remember the UT3 map at the time I wrote that though, and now I believe that\
      \ is probably the most likely candidate for a user's search, more likely than\
      \ either the U2 planet or mission. <small>—Preceding unsigned comment added\
      \ by [[Special:Contributions/Retodon8|Retodon8]] ([[User talk:Retodon8|talk]])</small>\n\
      \n::As you mention it, look at the Planets in Unreal Universe article and you'll\
      \ see a Sanctuary of UT2003/04... :) Disambiguation page plz. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 18:21, 19 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n::: I think a disambiguation page in this case\
      \ is undeniable. I'm sure that the UT3 map is the most likely candidate for\
      \ searches, however it is also technically DM-Sanctuary and you could again\
      \ make the argument that someone would reach it through the UT3 page before\
      \ searching for it :) I don't know which of the two is most appropriate, but\
      \ I do know the planet information is absolutely the LEAST likely information\
      \ that someone is looking for when searching for this. It is really not a case\
      \ of the information being un-needed at all. I just don't think it's likely\
      \ that is what someone is searching for when they type in the search terms.\
      \ To me it would be like someone searching for Face and having it take them\
      \ to a page about the facial animation software rather than a page about Face\
      \ or the disambiguation page for Face. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 22:57,\
      \ 19 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n::::Yes, people would instead search for DM-Sanctuary.\
      \ I'd say we should do the U2 Sanctuary walkthrough there,  with a FOR link\
      \ to disambiguation. We could vote for the page by the way :D --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 04:40, 20 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n----\n\nA lot of this other stuff is nice to\
      \ have, but it is superfluous information. Having a disambiguation page and\
      \ linking from the other article should be common practice, if you go to Wikipedia\
      \ and search for something, it will usually bring up the most common result\
      \ on the strict name and link to the disambiguation page for other uses. I believe\
      \ it is simply good practice to keep pages that will be commonly searched for\
      \ at the top of the chain. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 02:34, 19 April 2008\
      \ (EDT)\n\n:Like I said, I don't think articles on the planets mentioned...\
      \ actually fully featured in the game, is superfluous information. Yes, I am\
      \ one of those Unreal nuts I suppose, or rather I care about the background\
      \ story of any IP I like, whether it's Unreal or something else. I agree about\
      \ the DAB thing; see my response to GreatEmerald above. I don't feel all that\
      \ strongly about it though, and I'm just another wiki participant here, so as\
      \ long as the whole DAB thing is done right, it doesn't matter that much. [[User:Retodon8|Retodon8]]\
      \ 17:27, 19 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n::As I said above, I don't necessarily think\
      \ the information is unneeded as much as it is unlikely that a person would\
      \ be looking for it right away. I agree that the page is necessary, but the\
      \ content we want to push is the content we believe people are looking for first,\
      \ and drive them to the awesome information pages (like this one) that are really\
      \ off the beaten path. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 22:57, 19 April 2008 (EDT)\n\
      \n----\n\nI suggest voting for it then... What we need to know is: 1. How to\
      \ call planets and levels of the same name? 2. Where should the Atlantis Interlude\
      \ be? 3. What's on the main page of disambiguitive articles, like Sanctuary?\
      \ --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]] 15:30, 30 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n Current\
      \ votes:\n 1. 2 votes - use (planet) prefix.\n 2. 1 vote - make the Interlude\
      \ at the top and make a link.\n 3. 2 votes - Sanctuary for U2 walkthrough, others\
      \ in disambiguation.\n\nMy vote: 1. Use the traditional (planet) etc. prefix,\
      \ and for the main article - nothing. 2. At the top of the article with a FOR\
      \ shortcut to skip the part - saves scrolling time. 3. For Sanctuary - Sanctuary\
      \ (level) with a FOR to a disambiguation that contains Sanctuary (U2 planet),\
      \ Sanctuary (UT2003/4 planet), DM-Sanctuary. --[[User:GreatEmerald|GreatEmerald]]\
      \ 15:30, 30 April 2008 (EDT)\n\n: I think the best way to do it would have [[Sanctuary]]\
      \ be for the Unreal 2 level (3 - {{support}}), with a link at the top to a [[Sanctuary\
      \ (disambiguation)]] page.  The other pages could be named [[Sanctuary (Unreal\
      \ 2 planet)]] and [[Sanctuary (UT200x level)]]. (1 - {{support}}) – [[User:Haarg|Haarg]]\
