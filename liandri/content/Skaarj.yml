      <p>Skaarj are a lizard species; they typically stand between seven and nine\
      \ feet tall (8 feet on average) and weigh around 385 lbs.; they have scales\
      \ ranging in color from dark and light green to blue or yellow. They have an\
      \ overhanging forehead with glowing eyes burning underneath, short, curved tusks,\
      \ and, in the case of the Warrior caste, long, braided, scaly, dreadlocks arcing\
      \ off the back of their heads. Most Skaarj have thick tails, though this feature\
      \ seems to become increasingly reduced the farther along the Trooper caste a\
      \ Skaarj progresses.\n</p><p>The Skaarj have been officially described by Epic\
      \ as \"sophisticated savages\" and references are made in-game to their apparent\
      \ high level of technological development in contrast to their brutal and barbaric\

      <p>The Skaarj usually build structures out of metal. They also use different\
      \ forms of force fields and other energy items, although a lot less commonly.\
      \ All of their motherships are usually made of metal and powered by energy from\
      \ Skaarj generators. The generators are usually heavily defended and are the\
      \ main, but not only sources of power. Skaarj panels are usually holographic\
      \ and are capable of creating 3D holographic shapes. When Skaarj decide to build\
      \ a structure on the surface of a planet, they usually design them just like\
      \ the spaceships. These buildings don't contain anything organic other than\
      \ the creatures inside and often plain metal is displayed. Special decorations\
      \ are very rare, but if there are any, they are colored green. Their light sources,\
      \ although usually white, are sometimes green as well. This is most easily seen\
      \ in the map <a href=\"/CTF-HallOfGiants\" title=\"CTF-HallOfGiants\">CTF-HallOfGiants</a>,\
      \ where the Skaarj have illuminated all of the area with their green lights.\n\
      </p><p>There are many items that are of Skaarj origin, and they are usually\
      \ colored green or have the shape of their Razik. For example, the <a href=\"\
      /UDamage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UDamage\">UDamage</a> has absolutely\
      \ the same form as the Skaarj symbol. Panels and switches are often decorated\

      \ size makes her a little cumbersome. The player's main advantage is a pair\
      \ of unlimited Jump Boots which allow enough mobility to evade the massive Queen.\
      \ The Queen stands on her rear legs, which appear avian in structure, and balances\
      \ on a pair of less developed secondary legs which appear very insect-like.\
      \ Her main arms are humanoid. The Queen as a whole is not entirely humanoid,\
      \ but rather has a slightly centaur-ish look resulting from her avian or theropodian\
      \ hindquarters and massive tail. Her design is elegant, slender and dark. She\
      \ is almost beautiful, and captures very well the techno-gothic look that characterizes\

      \ Skaarj return for a less central role in the sequel to Unreal, Unreal 2: The\
      \ Awakening. The plot of the game centers around a set of mysterious artifacts\
      \ that several races and corporations are fighting for possession of. The Skaarj\
      \ are among the forces involved in the conflict, and appear as the main enemies\
      \ for the first two missions, and then play a central, if maybe not fully intentional,\
      \ role in key events near the end of the game. The Skaarj are among the races\
      \ experimented on by the Drakk, a race of self-aware machines, and a significant\
      \ portion of the final hybrid created by them that the player has the option\
      \ to face, deep in the Drakk Hive.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It was announced early on in Unreal 2's development\
      \ that the Skaarj would be divided up into clans that would be fighting amongst\
      \ themselves for control of the artifacts, but this feature did not end up making\
      \ a substantial appearance in the final release. Nonetheless, the clan-based\
      \ element expanded the Skaarj societal structure in a way that was later expanded\
      \ upon in UT 2004 and Unreal Championship 2. The Krall, the Skaarj's enslaved\
      \ hunting partners and guards, are replaced by the insane Izarians, suggesting\
      \ that the Skaarj Empire has a diverse well of species to draw assistance from,\
      \ and that various clans prefer different assistants.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\

      \ 2, resembling sleeker versions of the Skimmers from Unreal. It is possible\
      \ that they serve double-duty as fighter craft, as well. \nA new Skaarj weapon,\
      \ dubbed the Shock Lance by Isaac, is based upon ASMD technology, indicating\
      \ that the Skaarj are even now not above stealing and adapting alien technology\
      \ for their own uses. After a limiter has been applied that reduces the weapon's\
      \ power, the Skaarj give it to the Izarians, who use it as their primary weapon.\
      \ It appears as a high-tech trident or pitchfork which fires purple energy bolts,\
      \ or a powerful EMP ball. Later on Isaac is able to remove the limiter and the\
      \ player's Shock Lance becomes more powerful.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ href=\"/Razik\" title=\"Razik\">Razik</a>, which are now more fully depicted\
      \ as wrist-mounted devices. The claws on the Razik appear smaller, though not\
      \ by much, and are no longer retractable. The braided dreadlocks appear to take\
      \ on a finer, more hair-like texture, and appear to be fixed through a series\
      \ of diamond-shaped objects, giving the dreads their classic shape. The Skaarj\
      \ in Unreal 2 are a little more heavy-set than their classic counterparts, and\
      \ tend to be noticeably more aggressive. They retained their agility and will\
      \ still dodge and leap to avoid projectile fire, but, if fired upon with a rapid-fire,\
      \ instant hit weapon like the Duster Assault Rifle, they will block the shots\
      \ with their claws and continue moving forward, an ability which counters the\
      \ previous Skaarj's weakness to the original Minigun. Light Skaarj are fairly\
      \ weak, and can be dispatched fairly easily, but, due to the player's significantly\
      \ slower movement rate in Unreal 2 compared to Unreal, they can still be a respectable\
      \ threat.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ back out into proper ranged attack distance. At range, they fire either a\

      \ Varied\n| meleedamage= Varied\n| abilities= Varied\n| appearances= *[[Unreal]]\n\
      *[[Return to Na Pali]]\n*[[Unreal 2]]\n*[[Unreal Tournament 2004]]\n}}\n\nThe\
      \ '''Skaarj''' are a powerful, imperial reptilian race with aims of subordinating\
      \ or destroying all other species, under the justification that the Skaarj are\
      \ naturally superior to all others.\n\n==Physiology==\n[[Image:SkaarjLogo.png|right|thumb|200px|The\
      \ official Skaarj symbol]]\nSkaarj are a lizard species; they typically stand\
      \ between seven and nine feet tall (8 feet on average) and weigh around 385\
      \ lbs.; they have scales ranging in color from dark and light green to blue\
      \ or yellow. They have an overhanging forehead with glowing eyes burning underneath,\
      \ short, curved tusks, and, in the case of the Warrior caste, long, braided,\
      \ scaly, dreadlocks arcing off the back of their heads. Most Skaarj have thick\
      \ tails, though this feature seems to become increasingly reduced the farther\
      \ along the Trooper caste a Skaarj progresses.\n\nThe Skaarj have been officially\
      \ described by Epic as \"sophisticated savages\" and references are made in-game\
      \ to their apparent high level of technological development in contrast to their\
      \ brutal and barbaric nature.\n\n==Technology==\nThe Skaarj are capable of extensive\
      \ space travel, and seem to be focused around a giant Mothership that houses\
      \ their Queen. Their technology is noticeably superior to that of humanity.\
      \ They move about the planet via [[Skaarj Skimmers]], relatively small anti-gravity\
      \ fighters that the player encounters twice throughout Unreal and RtNP, but\
      \ is never able to operate. The Skaarj engage in extensive and bizzarre experiments\
      \ ranging from genetic manipulation to energy-based experiments, seemingly aimed\
      \ at creating super-soldiers of one sort or another. A fair portion of the weapons\
      \ in Unreal are of Skaarj origin, including the [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball]],\
      \ [[Razorjack]], [[Ripper]] [[Flak Cannon#Unreal]], and, to an extent, the [[Stinger]].\n\
      \n==Architecture and symbols==\n[[Image:SkaarjPanel.png|thumb|right|A holographic\
      \ panel of the Skaarj]]\nThe official symbol of all the Skaarj is the [[Razik]]\
      \ blades (see the picture at the top). This design also inspired the main logo\
      \ of [[Unreal]]. Skaarj prefer green color, as it is the usual color of their\
      \ skin. Skaarj motherships have panels shaped as the Razik and the interior\
      \ of the ships are usually decorated with various accents of green color. Different\
      \ clans prefer slightly different colors - the Skaarj in Unreal prefer metal\
      \ gray, brown and green, while the Skaarj in [[Unreal Tournament 2004]] prefer\
      \ black and green.\n\n[[Image:SkaarjLight.png|thumb|right|128px|The green Skaarj\
      \ light]]\nThe Skaarj usually build structures out of metal. They also use different\
      \ forms of force fields and other energy items, although a lot less commonly.\
      \ All of their motherships are usually made of metal and powered by energy from\
      \ Skaarj generators. The generators are usually heavily defended and are the\
      \ main, but not only sources of power. Skaarj panels are usually holographic\
      \ and are capable of creating 3D holographic shapes. When Skaarj decide to build\
      \ a structure on the surface of a planet, they usually design them just like\
      \ the spaceships. These buildings don't contain anything organic other than\
      \ the creatures inside and often plain metal is displayed. Special decorations\
      \ are very rare, but if there are any, they are colored green. Their light sources,\
      \ although usually white, are sometimes green as well. This is most easily seen\
      \ in the map [[CTF-HallOfGiants]], where the Skaarj have illuminated all of\
      \ the area with their green lights.\n\nThere are many items that are of Skaarj\
      \ origin, and they are usually colored green or have the shape of their Razik.\
      \ For example, the [[UDamage]] has absolutely the same form as the Skaarj symbol.\
      \ Panels and switches are often decorated with their symbol or their writing.\n\
      {{clear}}\n\n==Unreal==\n==Social Structure==\nThe Skaarj presence on [[Na Pali]]\
      \ is separated into two main castes: Warriors and Troopers. Skaarj serve to\
      \ protect their Queen, and presumably follow the orders of the War Lord.\n\n\
      ===Warrior===\n''See [[Skaarj Warrior]] for more information''\n\nSkaarj Warriors\
      \ are the first caste of Skaarj the player encounters. They typically wear light\
      \ armor which facilitates their brutal, agile, martial-art style fighting techniques.\
      \ Their primary weapon is a device which later in the series became known as\
      \ a [[Razik]]: a wrist-mounted weapon bearing, in this case, two long, jagged,\
      \ retractable blades and a projectile energy blaster.\n\n===Trooper===\n''See\
      \ [[Skaarj Trooper]] for more information''\n\nPartway through the game, the\
      \ Trooper caste is introduced. Skaarj Troopers share some tactical similarities\
      \ to Warriors, but have they are more militaristic than the perhaps more traditional\
      \ Warriors, and they employ some different tactics and equipment.\n\n===Warlord===\n\
      ''See [[Warlord]] for more information''\n*Health: from 1100 to 1595\nAt the\
      \ top of the militaristic side of the Skaarj presence on Na Pali is the WarLord.\
      \ The WarLord towers over even a Berserker, wears a full-body armor suit with\
      \ a dark green and black color scheme, wields a large, heat-seeking missile\
      \ launcher, and possesses the ability to fly with a pair of large, bat-like\
      \ wings on his back. The WarLord is as agile in the air as other Skaarj are\
      \ on the ground, avoiding incoming fire and dodging out of the line of fire\
      \ of instant-hit weapons before you even fire at him. His missiles do significant\
      \ damage, and their ability to track the player makes them a formidable attack.\
      \ Up close, the WarLord will bash the player with his launcher, a surprisingly\
      \ clumsy seeming attack from such an agile race. In Unreal, you will have a\
      \ teaser fight with the WarLord in a lava-filled cave beneath the [[Nali Castle]]\
      \ called [[Demonlord's Lair]] and finally finish the battle inside the [[Skaarj\
      \ Generator]] inside the [[Skaarj Mothership]].\n\n===Pupae===\n''See [[Pupae]]\
      \ for more information''\n*Health: 65\nAll these Skaarj have to come from somewhere,\
      \ though. Halfway through the game, the player meets the Pupae form of the Skaarj\
      \ species. A relatively small (about 6 feet long, but only a foot or so tall)\
      \ insect-like creature that behaves almost more like a spider than a Skaarj,\
      \ though it still possesses the leap attack, the tusks, and the general face-shape.\
      \ Pupae are fairly weak, but in groups they can tear an unwary player apart\
      \ in seconds. They have a tell-tale hissing sound, and will tend to scratch\
      \ around on the ground, which can alert the player to their presence before\
      \ any pupae are actually seen. Pupae tend to congregate in groups, and live,\
      \ like spiders, in store-rooms and darkened, abandoned areas of Na Pali. They\
      \ may be hiding in crates every now and then. They can hide on walls and ceilings,\
      \ and drop down for surprise attacks. They will also hide underneath stairways\
      \ and other objects, waiting to ambush unwary prey. The [[Skaarj Mothership]]\
      \ has a few Pupae breeding areas that the player can become locked in for a\
      \ time, and the final arena, [[The Source]], is crawling with them throughout\
      \ the final fight. Some levels that were cut from the final release, known as\
      \ Soledad, Morose and Nexus, are a subterranean Pupae breeding facility that\
      \ employs a translucent purple fluid to feed the Pupae. This fluid is not seen\
      \ in the final game, however, so whether it is still a factor in Pupae development\
      \ is unknown. Pupae start to appear from [[The Sunspire]].\n\n===Queen===\n\
      ''See [[Skaarj Queen]] for more information''\n[[Image:Queen.jpg|thumb|The queen\
      \ of The Source]]\n*Health: from 1500 to 1800\nThe Source is the hive of the\
      \ all-important Skaarj Queen. The Skaarj have an insect-like social structure,\
      \ all centered around serving and protecting the Queen. The Queen herself is\
      \ a towering beast, roughly 20 feet tall, with six limbs, the ability to fire\
      \ several energy projectiles in sequence seemingly from her breasts, conjure\
      \ an impenetrable energy shield, and teleport at will (capable also of Telefrag).\
      \ The extent of her power is unknown, and she appears to meditate when not engaged\
      \ in combat. A degree of the Mothership's structural integrity may be held together\
      \ simply by her will, since the ship begins to collapse and explode once she\
      \ is killed (although, her lair isn't found in the [[Skaarj Mothership]], but\
      \ deep in Na Pali's ground). She is highly angered by the death of any of her\
      \ children, and will scream loud enough to shake the room when any Pupae are\
      \ killed in her presence. She is faster than the player, though her large size\
      \ makes her a little cumbersome. The player's main advantage is a pair of unlimited\
      \ Jump Boots which allow enough mobility to evade the massive Queen. The Queen\
      \ stands on her rear legs, which appear avian in structure, and balances on\
      \ a pair of less developed secondary legs which appear very insect-like. Her\
      \ main arms are humanoid. The Queen as a whole is not entirely humanoid, but\
      \ rather has a slightly centaur-ish look resulting from her avian or theropodian\
      \ hindquarters and massive tail. Her design is elegant, slender and dark. She\
      \ is almost beautiful, and captures very well the techno-gothic look that characterizes\
      \ Unreal. A wonderful and memorable boss fight, ranking right up there with\
      \ the Cyberdemon of Doom fame.\n\n==Unreal 2==\n\n===The Skaarj's Role===\n\
      The Skaarj return for a less central role in the sequel to Unreal, Unreal 2:\
      \ The Awakening. The plot of the game centers around a set of mysterious artifacts\
      \ that several races and corporations are fighting for possession of. The Skaarj\
      \ are among the forces involved in the conflict, and appear as the main enemies\
      \ for the first two missions, and then play a central, if maybe not fully intentional,\
      \ role in key events near the end of the game. The Skaarj are among the races\
      \ experimented on by the Drakk, a race of self-aware machines, and a significant\
      \ portion of the final hybrid created by them that the player has the option\
      \ to face, deep in the Drakk Hive.\n\n===Social Structure===\nIt was announced\
      \ early on in Unreal 2's development that the Skaarj would be divided up into\
      \ clans that would be fighting amongst themselves for control of the artifacts,\
      \ but this feature did not end up making a substantial appearance in the final\
      \ release. Nonetheless, the clan-based element expanded the Skaarj societal\
      \ structure in a way that was later expanded upon in UT 2004 and Unreal Championship\
      \ 2. The Krall, the Skaarj's enslaved hunting partners and guards, are replaced\
      \ by the insane Izarians, suggesting that the Skaarj Empire has a diverse well\
      \ of species to draw assistance from, and that various clans prefer different\
      \ assistants.\n\n===Technology===\nSkaarj dropships appear briefly at the end\
      \ of Unreal 2, resembling sleeker versions of the Skimmers from Unreal. It is\
      \ possible that they serve double-duty as fighter craft, as well. \nA new Skaarj\
      \ weapon, dubbed the Shock Lance by Isaac, is based upon ASMD technology, indicating\
      \ that the Skaarj are even now not above stealing and adapting alien technology\
      \ for their own uses. After a limiter has been applied that reduces the weapon's\
      \ power, the Skaarj give it to the Izarians, who use it as their primary weapon.\
      \ It appears as a high-tech trident or pitchfork which fires purple energy bolts,\
      \ or a powerful EMP ball. Later on Isaac is able to remove the limiter and the\
      \ player's Shock Lance becomes more powerful.\n\n===Organization===\nThe Skaarj\
      \ are divided, like most of Unreal 2's characters, into three weight classes:\
      \ light, medium and heavy. The War Lord and Queen make no appearance in Unreal\
      \ 2.\n\n====Light====\n''See [[Light Skaarj]] for more information''\n[[Image:LightSkaarj.PNG|thumb|right|125px|Light\
      \ Skaarj of Unreal 2]]\n*Health: 150\nBearing a resemblance to the classic Skaarj\
      \ Warriors, these are the smallest of the Skaarj classes, and wear no armor\
      \ besides their [[Razik]], which are now more fully depicted as wrist-mounted\
      \ devices. The claws on the Razik appear smaller, though not by much, and are\
      \ no longer retractable. The braided dreadlocks appear to take on a finer, more\
      \ hair-like texture, and appear to be fixed through a series of diamond-shaped\
      \ objects, giving the dreads their classic shape. The Skaarj in Unreal 2 are\
      \ a little more heavy-set than their classic counterparts, and tend to be noticeably\
      \ more aggressive. They retained their agility and will still dodge and leap\
      \ to avoid projectile fire, but, if fired upon with a rapid-fire, instant hit\
      \ weapon like the Duster Assault Rifle, they will block the shots with their\
      \ claws and continue moving forward, an ability which counters the previous\
      \ Skaarj's weakness to the original Minigun. Light Skaarj are fairly weak, and\
      \ can be dispatched fairly easily, but, due to the player's significantly slower\
      \ movement rate in Unreal 2 compared to Unreal, they can still be a respectable\
      \ threat.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Medium====\n[[Image:MediumSkaarj.PNG|thumb|right|100px|Unreal\
      \ 2 medium Skaarj]]\n*Health: 150\nThese slightly larger Skaarj wear a fair\
      \ amount of armor, including boots, thigh pads, a full chest plate, and shoulder\
      \ pads. Spikes adorn the top of the boots and chest plate, and curved blades\
      \ follow the countours of the thigh and shoulder pads. The armor appears a little\
      \ more clumsy and impractical than that of the classic Skaarj, which would seem\
      \ to suggest a difference in combat style and priorities among Skaarj clans.\
      \ Beyond appearances, Medium Skaarj behave like Light Skaarj, but are able to\
      \ withstand and deal out more damage. When killed, their armor gives off a latent\
      \ energy charge that the player can absorb to add to his own energy shielding\
      \ level.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Heavy====\n[[Image:HeavySkaarj.PNG|thumb|right|125px|Heavy\
      \ Skaarj of Unreal 2]]\n*Health: 600\nHeavy Skaarj seem uncharacteristic of\
      \ what one would immediately expect a Skaarj to be. They are entirely encased\
      \ in heavy power armor, and as a result move slowly and deliberately, favoring\
      \ ranged attacks over melee. The melee attack they do have throws the player\
      \ back out into proper ranged attack distance. At range, they fire either a\
      \ volley of smaller energy bolts or a larger charged-shot that will track the\
      \ player. The Heavy class appears once at the end of the first mission in a\
      \ small pit, and later several Heavy Skaarj appear in various circumstances\
      \ on the second to last mission. They can withstand and dish-out a significant\
      \ amount of damage, but lack any real dodging capabilities, making them easy\
      \ targets, providing the player can find cover from the powerful energy blasts.\
      \ Like the Medium Skaarj, Heavy Skaarj also give off a latent energy shield\
      \ charge once killed.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Skaarj in the Tournament==\n[[Image:Dominator-ut1.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Dominator,\
      \ a Skaarj hybrid in Unreal Tournament]]\nA number of Skaarj have fought in\
      \ the [[Liandri Grand Tournament]].\n\nBy 2291 (the time period of [[UT]]) the\
      \ [[New Earth Government]], inspired by the Skaarj's abilities in the [[Human-Skaarj\
      \ War]], had developed the [[Skaarj Hybrid|Human/Skaarj Hybrid]], meant to be\
      \ used as a leading force in ground based ops. To test the Hybrids, the NEG\
      \ entered two teams: [[Red Claw]] and [[Iron Skull]] into the Tournament.\n\n\
      {{clear}}\n[[Image:Dominator.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Dominator in Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2004, pure Skaarj this time]]\nIn 2303 (the time period of [[UT2004]]) a team\
      \ of pure Skaarj from the [[Iron Skull]] clan enter the Tournament. It is unknown\
      \ how they are related to the Hybrids who fought under the same name in the\
      \ earlier Tournament. What is known is that the Skaarj Empire holds them responsible\
      \ for the loss of the Skaarj Mothership during the [[Human-Skaarj War]] in 2216.\n\
      \nLater in that Tournament, the two brothers Mekkor and Skrilax of the [[Black\
      \ Fist]] Clan enter the Tournament to test their new [[cybernetic]] armor, which\
      \ replaces entire limbs lost in battle. Because of this they are referred to\
      \ as MechaSkaarj.\n\nOne of the Tournament's [[Assault]] matches centers around\
      \ the destruction of a Skaarj mothership attacking [[Earth]] at the end of the\
      \ [[Human-Skaarj War]] in 2216. The mothership and the Skaarj [[Skaarj Space\
      \ Fighter|Black Scorpion]] spacefighter are recreated.\n\nDuring the time period\
      \ of [[UC2]], [[Torgr]] and his tribe enter their slave [[Szalor]] in the [[Ascension\
      \ Rites|Nakhti Ascension Rites]], a qualifying round for the Tournament, hoping\
      \ to watch an entertaining death. Torgr himself enters hoping to win and prove\
      \ himself worthy of being consort to the [[#Queen|Queen]]. His wish is to unify\
      \ the Skaarj and their slave races and conquer the galaxy.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\
