      /The_Ceremonial_Chambers\" title=\"The Ceremonial Chambers\">Ceremonial Chambers</a>\
      \ of the Nali water God lurks the darker side of <a href=\"/Nali\" title=\"\
      Nali\">Nali</a> history. This ancient and imposing structure is now used by\
      \ the <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> as a torture house and\
      \ detention centre for Nali natives and human crash victims alike... but within\
      \ the structure something even worse lurks.\n</p><p>You start in the hole you\
      \ jumped down at the end of The Ceremonial Chambers, and plunge into a pool\
      \ of water beneath.\n</p><p>Climb out of the water and on to a small stone ledge.\
      \ Follow it along and descend the ladder on the other side. There is a Health\
      \ Pack under the ladder if you need it. As you proceed down the next corridor\
      \ you will hear a splash and a familiar growl from behind you. No prizes for\
      \ guessing what that is, so turn around and face the ladder. Use a good weapon\
      \ and slaughter the SkaarjWarrior who has followed you in.\n</p><p>Follow the\
      \ corridor round and you will see monk statues and a shut door with no visible\
      \ means to open it. So, return to the corridor. Shoot the vase and barrel open\
      \ but they reveal nothing.\n</p><p>The switch is actually one of the several\
      \ carved face blocks on the corridor wall. If you stand in the corner of the\
      \ corridor looking at the big doors, it is the one that faces you on the right.\
      \ So, press it. Shortly the big doors will open. Step through, and the doors\
      \ close behind you.\n</p><p>Descend the flight of steps beyond and collect two\
      \ cans of 12 Eightballs from behind the light fixture at the bottom. Follow\
      \ the stairs round to the left and walk along a short stretch of corridor, and\
      \ the music will start as you emerge into a huge open area with tall cliffs.\n\
      </p><p>The eerie wasteland out here contains the looming wall of a large structure\
      \ in the middle - the dark arena. Note the Nali Healing Fruit to either side\
      \ of the doorway you've just emerged from. Then, head around to the right until\
      \ you reach the point where the curving wall of the arena meets the tall cliffs.\
      \ There are Tarydium Shards and Nali Healing Fruit here.\n</p><p>Follow the\
      \ curvature of the arena building round until you reach a grand flight of steps\
      \ to two doors. This is the main entrance, bordered by torches and a flag on\
      \ a high mast. A Nali is crucified high on the wall; put him out of his misery.\
      \ If you can lob an Eightball grenade onto the roof of the arena, you may see\
      \ a very odd message!&#160;:)\n</p><p>Don't go in just yet. Continue round the\
      \ wasteland until you come to a patch of earth with four-armed crucifixes guarded\
      \ by a SkaarjWaarior. Kill the SkaarjWarrior and the crucified Nali here, then\
      \ collect the Nali Healing Fruit and <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a> in this area. Follow the fortress\
      \ on round.\n</p><p>Eventually you will reach a dead Nali by a poorly repaired\
      \ patch of the wall that has been broken open. Take the replacement <a href=\"\
      /Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a> dropped by the unfortunate\
      \ Nali, then read his diary [1].\n</p><p>That's it, time to deal with these\
      \ damned Skaarj. Blast the weakened wall open with a secondary fire charged\
      \ <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a>,\
      \ then descend the Nali's tunnel into his open cell. As you enter the evil building\
      \ you will hear screams and cries; try your best to ignore them. Leave the open\
      \ cell into the prison corridor, but be alert because there is a SkaarjScout\
      \ on patrol in this area who will ambush you at some point.\n</p><p>The other\
      \ cells here are currently locked. Take a left and go through a wooden door\
      \ that is on your left after you go round a dark right-hand corner. Enter the\
      \ room, where you will see steps leading up to a balcony where a lever controls\
      \ a lift which is a shortcut up to the main arena. I strongly advise against\
      \ taking this shortcut.\n</p><p>Kill the SkaarjWarrior guarding this room from\
      \ the balcony, then leave the room back into the prison corridor. Find the corridor\
      \ that crosses straight through the middle and follow it so that you come out\
      \ on the opposite side of the prison corridor ring, where there are two more\
      \ wooden doors. Take the door on the right and you will find a walkway going\
      \ down to some cages over lava. Kill the SkaarjWarrior that runs up from below.\n\
      </p><p>The middle cage has a Nali trapped in it. Sadly, there is nothing you\
      \ can do to release it. If you are of a sadistic disposition then you can press\
      \ the lever behind to ditch it into the lava, but I generally leave it to its\
      \ prayer.\n</p><p>Return to the prison corridor and take the other door. Here,\
      \ a SkaarjWarrior guards two switches on the wall and a <a href=\"/Stinger\"\
      \ title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> on a table. Kill the Skaarjwarrior and collect\
      \ the Stinger, plus Tarydium Shards from barrels in the corner. Press the two\
      \ switches to open the prison cells.\n</p><p>Return to the prison corridor ring\
      \ and explore the cells; I do this clockwise. Note: some of the cells might\
      \ contain <a href=\"/Tentacle\" title=\"Tentacle\">Tentacles</a> on the ceiling.\
      \ This is generated at random, so I can't tell you which. Just have your <a\
      \ href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a> at the\
      \ ready.\n</p><p>Going clockwise: the first cell is the one you came in by.\
      \ Nothing new to see. Opposite, a Nali stands in a typical catatonic state.\
      \ Further along, the third cell contains bandages and a human corpse [2].\n\
      </p><p>The opposite cell contains a clip and another human corpse [3].\n</p><p>She\
      \ must have been a prisoner on the <a href=\"/Vortex_Rikers\" title=\"Vortex\
      \ Rikers\">Vortex Rikers</a>. Continuing clockwise to the other side of the\
      \ prison corridor ring, the fifth cell contains yet another human corpse [4].\n\
      </p><p>ISV Kran? A log mentioned that ship back at <a href=\"/NyLeve%27s_Falls\"\
      \ title=\"NyLeve's Falls\">NyLeve's Falls</a>. Maybe you'll get to see it later.\
      \ Anyway, continuing to the cell opposite, you'll find another human corpse\
      \ with a log [5].\n</p><p>The seventh cell contains another catatonic Nali and\
      \ a useful <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\"\
      >Shield Belt</a>. Opposite, the final cell contains Bandages and a dead Nali\
      \ [6].\n</p><p>More talk about the Messiah... anyway, that detour complete,\
      \ return to the room where the two switches were (it should be the first door\
      \ clockwise from here), and go through the door on the side wall. There is a\
      \ flight of steps beyond, but before going up, open the crates in the shadow\
      \ in the far corner to get a Health Pack and two Clips. Climb the steps and\
      \ pass through the door at the top; you will be in the foyer inside the main\
      \ entrance.\n</p><p>No need to go outside unless you left anything behind. There\
      \ is a flight of steps here up to a landing above, or a lift to the same place\
      \ as an alternative. First though, collect what you need of the Health Packs\
      \ and Clips from the alcoves at the back of the room. Go to the pedestal by\
      \ the steps and read the stone carving [7].\n</p><p>Sounds suitably ominous...\
      \ anyway, go up the steps and step on to the landing at the top. Two SkaarjScouts\
      \ will appear, one up here and one down below. Kill them both. (Note: if you\
      \ kill the one that appears up above and then can't find the other one, it will\
      \ have gone down the dungeon steps. Follow it and kill).\n</p><p>When both Skaarj\
      \ are dead, doors off the landing will unlock. Return up the stairs and take\
      \ the door that is to the left if you are facing the front doors.\n</p><p>The\
      \ sweeping corridor beyond goes all the way round the arena and back to the\
      \ landing at the other end. There are several doors turning off it that are\
      \ locked; to open them you will have to kill the two SkaarjWarriors patrolling\
      \ this corridor.\n</p><p>So, set off up the corridor and collect the Tarydium\
      \ Shards from the base of the first pillar. Continuing, you will reach the first\
      \ locked door up a few stairs on the left, either side of which is a Health\
      \ Pack. Further up, another pillar has a couple of Clips nearby. You should\
      \ meet the first SkaarjWarrior around this point, so kill it, but don't use\
      \ up your Eightballs - you'll see why soon.\n</p><p>You will soon arrive at\
      \ the next locked door on the left, with a smaller door opposite. You will quite\
      \ likely meet the other SkaarjWarrior now, so kill that too. Once both SkaarjWarriors\
      \ are dead, the smaller door opens, but first plunder the corridor for the rest\
      \ of its supplies including Health Packs, two cans of 12 Eightballs, two clusters\
      \ of 40 Tarydium Shards and two ASMD Cores.\nReturn to the smaller door that\
      \ opened and enter the small antechamber. Here, three levers must be pressed\
      \ to activate a mechanism to open the other locked doors.\n</p><p>Pass through\
      \ and you will be on a viewing balcony over a large arena with a central pillar.\
      \ This balcony is patrolled by a SkaarjWarrior; kill it but don't jump off yet.\
      \ Visit both extreme ends of the balcony to get two ASMD Cores and two Health\
      \ Packs. Save your game now!\n</p><p>That done, ready your <a href=\"/Eightball_Gun\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eightball Gun\">Eightball Gun</a>, drop down\
      \ and collect the Eightball Gun that lies on the ground there. Things are about\
      \ to get unpleasant: as you collect the Eightball Gun, the metal ring around\
      \ the central pillar rises violently and the three sets of huge double doors\
      \ around the arena slide open. From behind the flying dust, a huge <a href=\"\
      /Titan\" title=\"Titan\">Titan</a> comes thumping out. You are in for a real\
      \ fight here!\n</p><p>The Titan is huge and highly durable. Keeping the central\
      \ pillar between you and it to avoid the deadly rocks it hurls, circle strafe\
      \ and fire Eightball grenades in clusters at it whenever it appears from behind\
      \ the pillar. Expect to use almost all of your Eightballs if you're a good shot,\
      \ and more if you're a bad shot, before the Titan falls. Failing the Eightball\
      \ Gun, use the Stinger in primary fire or the Automag. When the Titan is dead,\
      \ the back wall of the alcove behind the middle doors will collapse revealing\
      \ a hole to a corridor beyond. Before going through, collect the contents of\
      \ the three alcoves: two Nali Healing Fruit, a Shield Belt and two cans of 12\
      \ Eightballs.\n</p><p>Go through the new hole and around a short corridor into\
      \ the area beyond, which is a small room beneath the door opening mechanism\
      \ above. Shoot open barrels here to collect two Health Packs, then press a switch\
      \ on the wall between two torches to open a door at the bottom of a short flight\
      \ of stairs. One short stretch of corridor later, you've exited the level.\n\
      </p><p>Note: There's a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> in a recess on top of the\
      \ main arena's central pillar. There are two ways to access it. It can be reached\
      \ by a well-timed lift jump off the rising gantry (jumping whilst the gantry\
      \ is in motion), making sure that you don't jump too late as the gantry begins\
      \ to decelerate towards the top. If the lift jump fails but you manage to stay\
      \ on the gantry, press yourself against the pillar. When the Titan hits the\
      \ ground, you will fly up and with some good trajectory control you can land\
      \ on the pack.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translator_Messages\"\

    text: "[[Image:DarkArena.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]\n'''Dark Arena''' is the eighth\
      \ map in [[Unreal|Unreal's]] single player game.\n; Author : [[Jeremy War]]\n\
      ; Description\n: Within a barren valley looms an ancient Nali structure with\
      \ an air of grim foreboding. As the player explores the perimeter of this remnant\
      \ of some darker chapter in Nali history, the distant growl of a terrible beast\
      \ suggests that a tough fight lies ahead.\n{{clear}}\n==Weapons and Items==\n\

      * [[Nali bird]]\n* [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|Skaarj Scout]]\n* [[Nali]]\n\
      * [[Tentacle]]\n\n\n\n==Walkthrough==\nBeyond the [[The Ceremonial Chambers|Ceremonial\
      \ Chambers]] of the Nali water God lurks the darker side of [[Nali]] history.\
      \ This ancient and imposing structure is now used by the [[Skaarj]] as a torture\
      \ house and detention centre for Nali natives and human crash victims alike...\
      \ but within the structure something even worse lurks.\n\nYou start in the hole\
      \ you jumped down at the end of The Ceremonial Chambers, and plunge into a pool\
      \ of water beneath.\n\nClimb out of the water and on to a small stone ledge.\
      \ Follow it along and descend the ladder on the other side. There is a Health\
      \ Pack under the ladder if you need it. As you proceed down the next corridor\
      \ you will hear a splash and a familiar growl from behind you. No prizes for\
      \ guessing what that is, so turn around and face the ladder. Use a good weapon\
      \ and slaughter the SkaarjWarrior who has followed you in.\n\nFollow the corridor\
      \ round and you will see monk statues and a shut door with no visible means\
      \ to open it. So, return to the corridor. Shoot the vase and barrel open but\
      \ they reveal nothing.\n\nThe switch is actually one of the several carved face\
      \ blocks on the corridor wall. If you stand in the corner of the corridor looking\
      \ at the big doors, it is the one that faces you on the right. So, press it.\
      \ Shortly the big doors will open. Step through, and the doors close behind\
      \ you.\n\nDescend the flight of steps beyond and collect two cans of 12 Eightballs\
      \ from behind the light fixture at the bottom. Follow the stairs round to the\
      \ left and walk along a short stretch of corridor, and the music will start\
      \ as you emerge into a huge open area with tall cliffs.\n\nThe eerie wasteland\
      \ out here contains the looming wall of a large structure in the middle - the\
      \ dark arena. Note the Nali Healing Fruit to either side of the doorway you've\
      \ just emerged from. Then, head around to the right until you reach the point\
      \ where the curving wall of the arena meets the tall cliffs. There are Tarydium\
      \ Shards and Nali Healing Fruit here.\n\nFollow the curvature of the arena building\
      \ round until you reach a grand flight of steps to two doors. This is the main\
      \ entrance, bordered by torches and a flag on a high mast. A Nali is crucified\
      \ high on the wall; put him out of his misery. If you can lob an Eightball grenade\
      \ onto the roof of the arena, you may see a very odd message! :)\n\nDon't go\
      \ in just yet. Continue round the wasteland until you come to a patch of earth\
      \ with four-armed crucifixes guarded by a SkaarjWaarior. Kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ and the crucified Nali here, then collect the Nali Healing Fruit and [[Assault\
      \ Vest]] in this area. Follow the fortress on round.\n\nEventually you will\
      \ reach a dead Nali by a poorly repaired patch of the wall that has been broken\
      \ open. Take the replacement [[Flashlight]] dropped by the unfortunate Nali,\
      \ then read his diary [1].\n\nThat's it, time to deal with these damned Skaarj.\
      \ Blast the weakened wall open with a secondary fire charged [[Dispersion Pistol]],\
      \ then descend the Nali's tunnel into his open cell. As you enter the evil building\
      \ you will hear screams and cries; try your best to ignore them. Leave the open\
      \ cell into the prison corridor, but be alert because there is a SkaarjScout\
      \ on patrol in this area who will ambush you at some point.\n\nThe other cells\
      \ here are currently locked. Take a left and go through a wooden door that is\
      \ on your left after you go round a dark right-hand corner. Enter the room,\
      \ where you will see steps leading up to a balcony where a lever controls a\
      \ lift which is a shortcut up to the main arena. I strongly advise against taking\
      \ this shortcut.\n\nKill the SkaarjWarrior guarding this room from the balcony,\
      \ then leave the room back into the prison corridor. Find the corridor that\
      \ crosses straight through the middle and follow it so that you come out on\
      \ the opposite side of the prison corridor ring, where there are two more wooden\
      \ doors. Take the door on the right and you will find a walkway going down to\
      \ some cages over lava. Kill the SkaarjWarrior that runs up from below.\n\n\
      The middle cage has a Nali trapped in it. Sadly, there is nothing you can do\
      \ to release it. If you are of a sadistic disposition then you can press the\
      \ lever behind to ditch it into the lava, but I generally leave it to its prayer.\n\
      \nReturn to the prison corridor and take the other door. Here, a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ guards two switches on the wall and a [[Stinger]] on a table. Kill the Skaarjwarrior\
      \ and collect the Stinger, plus Tarydium Shards from barrels in the corner.\
      \ Press the two switches to open the prison cells.\n\nReturn to the prison corridor\
      \ ring and explore the cells; I do this clockwise. Note: some of the cells might\
      \ contain [[Tentacle]]s on the ceiling. This is generated at random, so I can't\
      \ tell you which. Just have your [[Automag]] at the ready.\n\nGoing clockwise:\
      \ the first cell is the one you came in by. Nothing new to see. Opposite, a\
      \ Nali stands in a typical catatonic state. Further along, the third cell contains\
      \ bandages and a human corpse [2].\n\nThe opposite cell contains a clip and\
      \ another human corpse [3].\n\nShe must have been a prisoner on the [[Vortex\
      \ Rikers]]. Continuing clockwise to the other side of the prison corridor ring,\
      \ the fifth cell contains yet another human corpse [4].\n\nISV Kran? A log mentioned\
      \ that ship back at [[NyLeve's Falls]]. Maybe you'll get to see it later. Anyway,\
      \ continuing to the cell opposite, you'll find another human corpse with a log\
      \ [5].\n\nThe seventh cell contains another catatonic Nali and a useful [[Shield\
      \ Belt]]. Opposite, the final cell contains Bandages and a dead Nali [6].\n\n\
      More talk about the Messiah... anyway, that detour complete, return to the room\
      \ where the two switches were (it should be the first door clockwise from here),\
      \ and go through the door on the side wall. There is a flight of steps beyond,\
      \ but before going up, open the crates in the shadow in the far corner to get\
      \ a Health Pack and two Clips. Climb the steps and pass through the door at\
      \ the top; you will be in the foyer inside the main entrance.\n\nNo need to\
      \ go outside unless you left anything behind. There is a flight of steps here\
      \ up to a landing above, or a lift to the same place as an alternative. First\
      \ though, collect what you need of the Health Packs and Clips from the alcoves\
      \ at the back of the room. Go to the pedestal by the steps and read the stone\
      \ carving [7].\n\nSounds suitably ominous... anyway, go up the steps and step\
      \ on to the landing at the top. Two SkaarjScouts will appear, one up here and\
      \ one down below. Kill them both. (Note: if you kill the one that appears up\
      \ above and then can't find the other one, it will have gone down the dungeon\
      \ steps. Follow it and kill).\n\nWhen both Skaarj are dead, doors off the landing\
      \ will unlock. Return up the stairs and take the door that is to the left if\
      \ you are facing the front doors.\n\nThe sweeping corridor beyond goes all the\
      \ way round the arena and back to the landing at the other end. There are several\
      \ doors turning off it that are locked; to open them you will have to kill the\
      \ two SkaarjWarriors patrolling this corridor.\n\nSo, set off up the corridor\
      \ and collect the Tarydium Shards from the base of the first pillar. Continuing,\
      \ you will reach the first locked door up a few stairs on the left, either side\
      \ of which is a Health Pack. Further up, another pillar has a couple of Clips\
      \ nearby. You should meet the first SkaarjWarrior around this point, so kill\
      \ it, but don't use up your Eightballs - you'll see why soon.\n\nYou will soon\
      \ arrive at the next locked door on the left, with a smaller door opposite.\
      \ You will quite likely meet the other SkaarjWarrior now, so kill that too.\
      \ Once both SkaarjWarriors are dead, the smaller door opens, but first plunder\
      \ the corridor for the rest of its supplies including Health Packs, two cans\
      \ of 12 Eightballs, two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and two ASMD Cores.\n\
      Return to the smaller door that opened and enter the small antechamber. Here,\
      \ three levers must be pressed to activate a mechanism to open the other locked\
      \ doors.\n\nPass through and you will be on a viewing balcony over a large arena\
      \ with a central pillar. This balcony is patrolled by a SkaarjWarrior; kill\
      \ it but don't jump off yet. Visit both extreme ends of the balcony to get two\
      \ ASMD Cores and two Health Packs. Save your game now!\n\nThat done, ready your\
      \ [[Eightball Gun]], drop down and collect the Eightball Gun that lies on the\
      \ ground there. Things are about to get unpleasant: as you collect the Eightball\
      \ Gun, the metal ring around the central pillar rises violently and the three\
      \ sets of huge double doors around the arena slide open. From behind the flying\
      \ dust, a huge [[Titan]] comes thumping out. You are in for a real fight here!\n\
      \nThe Titan is huge and highly durable. Keeping the central pillar between you\
      \ and it to avoid the deadly rocks it hurls, circle strafe and fire Eightball\
      \ grenades in clusters at it whenever it appears from behind the pillar. Expect\
      \ to use almost all of your Eightballs if you're a good shot, and more if you're\
      \ a bad shot, before the Titan falls. Failing the Eightball Gun, use the Stinger\
      \ in primary fire or the Automag. When the Titan is dead, the back wall of the\
      \ alcove behind the middle doors will collapse revealing a hole to a corridor\
      \ beyond. Before going through, collect the contents of the three alcoves: two\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit, a Shield Belt and two cans of 12 Eightballs.\n\nGo through\
      \ the new hole and around a short corridor into the area beyond, which is a\
      \ small room beneath the door opening mechanism above. Shoot open barrels here\
      \ to collect two Health Packs, then press a switch on the wall between two torches\
      \ to open a door at the bottom of a short flight of stairs. One short stretch\
      \ of corridor later, you've exited the level.\n\nNote: There's a [[Super Health\
      \ Pack]] in a recess on top of the main arena's central pillar. There are two\
      \ ways to access it. It can be reached by a well-timed lift jump off the rising\
      \ gantry (jumping whilst the gantry is in motion), making sure that you don't\
      \ jump too late as the gantry begins to decelerate towards the top. If the lift\
      \ jump fails but you manage to stay on the gantry, press yourself against the\
      \ pillar. When the Titan hits the ground, you will fly up and with some good\
      \ trajectory control you can land on the pack.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n\
