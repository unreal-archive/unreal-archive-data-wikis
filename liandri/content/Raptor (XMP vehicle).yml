      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velociraptor\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:Velociraptor\"\
      >Velociraptor</a> for its speed) is a vehicle, similar to the <a href=\"/Scorpion\"\
      \ title=\"Scorpion\">Scorpion</a> in both <a href=\"/UT2004\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"UT2004\">UT2004</a> and <a href=\"/UT3\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\

      \ two seats. The first seat is for a driver, it has no weapons; the second seat\
      \ is a very inaccurate, explosive round shooting assault turret.\n</p><p>It\
      \ is the quickest way of getting around in <a href=\"/XMP\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"XMP\">XMP</a> and very suitable for transporting Artifacts. Because\

      \ function</div></div></div>\n<p>The Raptor is the most useful when both seats\
      \ are occupied, so when you enter one, either drive to your base and ask someone\
      \ to get into the vehicle, or enter the second seat and wait for somebody to\
      \ come yourself. The turret is very powerful, especially at close range, and\
      \ can take out en enemy in seconds; however, it's not as useful in long ranges,\
      \ as it has a wide spread.\n</p><p>When driving, use the Boost ability wisely.\
      \ It charges fastly, so use it often. It is also a very useful function for\
      \ gutblowing unsuspecting enemies. Boost is also used for the secret Dixie horn:\
      \ boost and just after you press the boost key, press the horn key to hear the\
      \ Dixie horn.\n</p><p>The main use of the Raptor is to use it for transport\
      \ to the enemy base, and especially out of it. If there is no Raptor spawn point\
      \ in the enemy base, make sure you exit your own vehicle in an easily reachable\
      \ place, but be careful not to give it to your opponents. If the enemy base\
      \ has a Raptor already, boost into a <a href=\"/Harbinger\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Harbinger\">Harbinger</a> or another vehicle and eject just before\
      \ crashing to destroy both vehicles, and after taking the Artifact, use the\
      \ base's Raptor to make sure enemies can't chase you.\n</p><p>Raptor can also\
      \ be used for a transport technique known as Raptor Concussion Jumps. You need\
      \ two people for it: a driver and a Gunner with Concussion Grenades. The Gunner\
      \ must time it right to drop a Concussion Grenade just under the vehicle just\
      \ at the moment it boosts. That results in a very long and high jump, allowing\
      \ the driver to reach otherwise unreachable places, such as the top of the mountains\
      \ in <a href=\"/XMP-Sirocco\" title=\"XMP-Sirocco\">XMP-Sirocco</a>.\n</p>\n\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Raptor is rather light, and it doesn't need much\
      \ damage to take out. The best weapon to use against them is the <a href=\"\
      /Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"Grenade Launcher\">Grenade Launcher</a> with Concussion\
      \ Grenades. They will send the vehicle flying, and inflict a lot of damage when\
      \ it lands. Usual anti-vehicle equipment works good too - EMP grenades or <a\
      \ href=\"/Shock_Lance\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shock Lance\">Shock Lance</a>'s\
      \ EMP fire will usually destroy the vehicle in one shot.\n</p><p>In U2XMP, Raptor\
      \ is a perfect vehicle to plant Laser Trip Mines for quick kills. Crouch under\
      \ a Raptor in the enemy base, walk as far as you can under it and plant a <a\
      \ href=\"/Laser_Trip_Mine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Laser Trip Mine\"\
      >Laser Trip Mine</a> on the Raptor. The mine will be nearly invisible, and its\
      \ explosion is guaranteed to destroy the vehicle and the driver.\n</p><p><br\

      \ boosts into another vehicle.\n\n===Using the Raptor===\n[[Image:Raptor-GB.jpg|thumb|right|256px|A\
      \ Raptor using its Gutblow function]]\nThe Raptor is the most useful when both\
      \ seats are occupied, so when you enter one, either drive to your base and ask\
      \ someone to get into the vehicle, or enter the second seat and wait for somebody\
      \ to come yourself. The turret is very powerful, especially at close range,\
      \ and can take out en enemy in seconds; however, it's not as useful in long\
      \ ranges, as it has a wide spread.\n\nWhen driving, use the Boost ability wisely.\
      \ It charges fastly, so use it often. It is also a very useful function for\
      \ gutblowing unsuspecting enemies. Boost is also used for the secret Dixie horn:\
      \ boost and just after you press the boost key, press the horn key to hear the\
      \ Dixie horn.\n\nThe main use of the Raptor is to use it for transport to the\
      \ enemy base, and especially out of it. If there is no Raptor spawn point in\
      \ the enemy base, make sure you exit your own vehicle in an easily reachable\
      \ place, but be careful not to give it to your opponents. If the enemy base\
      \ has a Raptor already, boost into a [[Harbinger]] or another vehicle and eject\
      \ just before crashing to destroy both vehicles, and after taking the Artifact,\
      \ use the base's Raptor to make sure enemies can't chase you.\n\nRaptor can\
      \ also be used for a transport technique known as Raptor Concussion Jumps. You\
      \ need two people for it: a driver and a Gunner with Concussion Grenades. The\
      \ Gunner must time it right to drop a Concussion Grenade just under the vehicle\
      \ just at the moment it boosts. That results in a very long and high jump, allowing\
      \ the driver to reach otherwise unreachable places, such as the top of the mountains\
      \ in [[XMP-Sirocco]].\n\n===Going against the Raptor===\nThe Raptor is rather\
      \ light, and it doesn't need much damage to take out. The best weapon to use\
      \ against them is the [[Grenade Launcher]] with Concussion Grenades. They will\
      \ send the vehicle flying, and inflict a lot of damage when it lands. Usual\
      \ anti-vehicle equipment works good too - EMP grenades or [[Shock Lance]]'s\
      \ EMP fire will usually destroy the vehicle in one shot.\n\nIn U2XMP, Raptor\
      \ is a perfect vehicle to plant Laser Trip Mines for quick kills. Crouch under\
      \ a Raptor in the enemy base, walk as far as you can under it and plant a [[Laser\
      \ Trip Mine]] on the Raptor. The mine will be nearly invisible, and its explosion\
      \ is guaranteed to destroy the vehicle and the driver.\n\n{{vehicles}}"
