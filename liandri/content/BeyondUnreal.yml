      <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"First.2C_a_little_history...\">First, a\
      \ little history...</span></h3>\n<hr />\n<p>Way back in the summer of 1998,\
      \ Unreal 1 was released.  The Unreal-engine website scene was relatively new,\
      \ and there were a large number of community-run sites doing a great job of\
      \ imparting Unreal-engine files and information to the gaming public.  Some\
      \ we were particularly fond of, the original Org, Shadows, and Max's Unreal\
      \ News, the venerable Unreal Nation, Unreal Kingdom, Demigod's Unreal map site\
      \ and many, many more.\n<br /><br />\nIn the fall of 1998, PlanetUnreal, which\
      \ was originally UNA out of Australia, featuring the likes of San, Arcane, Mia'cova\
      \ and Mek, began to assemble a number of absolute Unrealaholics as their administration\
      \ team.  Yellow5, Stallion, QAPete, Alien8, Zaccix, Prophetus, Sparky, Hal,\
      \ Rojazz and others began building what became the biggest Unreal-engine gaming\
      \ site in the world.  Traffic to the site increased seven-fold, and the boys\
      \ even hosted the official Unreal Tournament Release Party live on the internet\
      \ in November of 1999.\n<br /><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"The_Beginning_of_the_End\">The Beginning of the End</span></h3>\n<hr\
      \ />\n<p>In early 2000, PU lost the free use of CDROM.COM, which was GameSpy's\
      \ main file mirror.  The complaints flooded in, and there was nothing the admin\
      \ team could do about it.  Around the same time, GSI began implementing its\
      \ plan for gaming domination, which included 'genre' sites like 3DActionPlanet,\
      \ FilePlanet, ForumPlanet and, ultimately, Giant Ad Banners of Death and pay\
      \ download servers.  The PU team also lost the ability to run the site the way\
      \ they saw fit.  Numerous GSI ads and links were included on the site, and basically,\
      \ PU turned away from being a community-run site to being a part of the corporation.\n\
      <br /><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Hammer_Comes_Down\"\
      >The Hammer Comes Down</span></h3>\n<hr />\n<p>In June of 2001, GameSpy decided\
      \ to immediately end existing verbal and written contracts with their Site Directors\
      \ and many of their paid 'help', replacing those contracts with one that implied\
      \ ownership of the sites, ownership of all developed materials, no guaranteed\
      \ minimum salaries and much more.  This was the final straw, and the PU admin\
      \ team, having been working together supporting the Unreal-engine community\
      \ for about 2 1/2 years, began leaving the site.\n<br /><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_New_Day_Dawns\">A New Day Dawns</span></h3>\n\
      <hr />\n<p>In October of 2001, the old PU admin team got together again and,\
      \ using their own Linux server, bandwidth and licensed copy of vBulletin software,\
      \ began what was to become BeyondUnreal by porting over their forums to the\
      \ new server in an effort to allow the former PlanetUnreal forumers to continue\
      \ posting using the now-familiar and very efficient vBulletin system, rather\
      \ than get pushed over to GSI's ForumPlanet software.  BeyondUnreal began hosting\
      \ sites, adding new admins such as the respected Tetris_L, larrystorch, RaptoR\
      \ and MalHavoc, from Stomped fame.  The new site design was completed by <a\
      \ rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.mixworld.com\"\
      >Matt 'Mix' Fox</a>, a new content management system was written by MalHavoc,\
      \ server administration tools were developed and the team obtained partners\
      \ to host downloadable files and provide those for free to the gaming public.\
      \  In May of 2002, less than a year after their departure from PlanetUnreal,\
      \ a new day dawned - BeyondUnreal was born!\n<br /><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"\
