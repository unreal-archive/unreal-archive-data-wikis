      \ be a bit smaller still, but it'll do. \nI've also described the weapons first\
      \ and the pickups later, since that's the order of importance, I reckon. Weapons\
      \ and pickups locations can be seen on the map, ammo's location is described\

      \ can find an icon for that), but I'm not sure if that's necessary. \nI have\
      \ to say I'm quite pleased with the way it looks now. It does need a Pictures\
