      \ never fully recuperates, but keeps participating in the Tournaments. Since\
      \ then the <a href=\"/Liandri_Mining_Corporation\" title=\"Liandri Mining Corporation\"\
      >Liandri</a> uses him as color commentator in their pre-game shows. During the\
      \ 523rd <a href=\"/Ascension_Rites\" title=\"Ascension Rites\">Nakhti Ascension\

      \ <a href=\"/Thunder_Crash\" title=\"Thunder Crash\">Thunder Crash</a>, but\
      \ Anubis declines.\n</p><p>It is possible, given Malcolm's affiliation with\
      \ the Liandri during the Ascension Rites tournament, that this offering was\
      \ an attempt by the Liandri presence on the planet to get Anubis out of the\
      \ way without having to pit him against Selket.  Selket was already in Liandri's\
      \ pocket, and while they were probably fairly confident that they could buy\
      \ Anubis over by manipulating his grief for his dead love (presuming he won\
      \ the final match to the death against Selket,) he was a much less certain thing.\
      \  So if Liandri could associate Anubis with Thunder Crash, it might prevent\
      \ him from pushing on to the finals and potentially disrupting their plans to\
      \ gain political control over the Nakhti planet via Selket, and avoid the potential\
      \ risk altogether, as well as maintaining both competitors (and their high ratings)\
      \ without becoming involved with the Phayder.  \n</p><p>Early-on, it is established\
      \ that the Liandri liaison is attempting to decide between Selket and Anubis,\
      \ and the match leading up to the Selket fight is artificially tilted in Anubis'\
      \ favor.  Most likely, once Anubis refused Malcolm's offer, and Liandri realized\
      \ Anubis' dedication to his ancestry, they concluded that he couldn't be bought\
      \ out so easily, and they decided to bank on him being easily manipulated after\
      \ the finals as a result of his prior relationship with Selket.  \n</p><p>If\
      \ this is true, then it is consistent with Malcolm's actions in UT3 (where he\
      \ sells out Reaper and his team to the Phayder to protect the Izanagi Corporation\
      \ from potential legal damages caused by Ronin's brash actions,) and with the\
      \ typical Unreal story-telling style, where characters are rarely all good or\
      \ all evil, but simply act on their own motivations.  Malcolm may come off as\
      \ a heroic character style on the surface, but he knows how to play the game\
      \ with the corporations. To him the Tournament is simply business, no matter\
      \ whose lives may be destroyed in the process.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ Phayder to protect the Izanagi Corporation from potential legal damages caused\
      \ by Ronin's brash actions,) and with the typical Unreal story-telling style,\
      \ where characters are rarely all good or all evil, but simply act on their\
      \ own motivations.  Malcolm may come off as a heroic character style on the\
      \ surface, but he knows how to play the game with the corporations. To him the\
      \ Tournament is simply business, no matter whose lives may be destroyed in the\
