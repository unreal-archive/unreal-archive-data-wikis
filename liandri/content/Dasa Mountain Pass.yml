      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Beyond the <a href=\"/Bluff_Eversmoking\" title=\"Bluff Eversmoking\"\
      >Bluff Eversmoking</a> lies the Dasa Mountain Pass. A high narrow rock canyon\
      \ is the gateway to some massive and ancient Nali cellars, but the Dasa Mountain\
      \ Pass and its cellars suffer from the worst <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\"\
      >Skaarj</a> infestation you've seen yet.\n</p><p>You start at the bottom of\
      \ the lift shaft from the previous map. Ahead is a double door; go through it\
      \ into a large hall partially converted by the Skaarj that is being used as\
      \ a storage room for large numbers of equipment crates from the ISV-Kran.\n\
      </p><p>The room seems empty but I assure you that it is not. Instead of going\
      \ up the centre of the storage facility, go round behind the first crate on\
      \ the left. You will meet in the shadows a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Guner\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjGunner</a> with a <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\"\
      \ title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a> whom you should kill.\n\
      </p><p>Make your target a crate further along at the back of the stacks whose\
      \ back is open. Go towards it - you may well be spotted by another SkaarjGunner\
      \ with a Dispersion Pistol on the way - and enter the open crate to grab a <a\
      \ href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>.\
      \ Now go back outside the crate stacks and continue up the centre of the room;\
      \ you will have to kill two more SkaarjGunners with Dispersion Pistols but eventually\
      \ you'll reach the far end of the hall.\n</p><p>The doors at the far end of\
      \ the hall are locked but it you look left from their position you'll see a\
      \ lever in a torchlit corner. Go between the pillars and press the lever to\
      \ open the doors. Then, go through the doors. They lead out into the mountain\
      \ pass itself, via a small foyer with two alcoves. Enter the alcove to the right\
      \ to grab an <a href=\"/Enforcer\" title=\"Enforcer\">Automag</a> and a <a href=\"\
      /Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flare</a> from a human corpse, then go out into the\
      \ pass itself.\n</p><p>This first stretch of pass is guardrd by a Krall whom\
      \ you should kill. When he is dead, open barrels for two Clips, then go round\
      \ the next corner and kill another Krall that attacks. In this area is a complicated\
      \ drawbridge currently in the raised position, a lever on the drawbridge itself,\
      \ and a log book on a pillar in an alcove to the right. Read the log book [1].\n\
      </p><p>Now go and look across the deep pit the drawbridge crosses.\n</p><p>Looking\
      \ across with the <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper Rifle\">Rifle</a>'s\
      \ zoom, you will see two Krall sentries patrolling or shooting at you from ground\
      \ level on the other side, and another on patrol from a rooftop beyond. Decapitate\
      \ all three then zoom back out again. Press the lever on the drawbridge mechanism\
      \ to lower it.\n</p><p>Cross the pit and try the doors in the structure ahead;\
      \ they are locked. So, go to the left and go down a corridor into the rock there.\
      \ You will shortly arrive in a room where a Krall on guard ducks behind some\
      \ barrels and shoots at you. Kill the Krall and collect the two Clips from the\
      \ barrels, then collect the <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\"\
      >Eightball Gun</a> on offer in the same corner. Take the next corridor out of\
      \ the room, stopping by at an alcove where barrels contain another two Clips.\
      \ Follow the corridor to its conclusion and you will be in another room where\
      \ two Krall and a KrallElite sit playing dice. Blow them up with Eightballs.\n\
      </p><p>Crates in corners on the left of the room reveal two Clips, a can of\
      \ Tarydium Sludge and an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a>. There are two ASMD Cores in corners on the\
      \ right. When you've collected stuff, read the log books on the table at the\
      \ back [2-4].\n</p><p>That's all for this room, and it's revealed nothing of\
      \ any use in terms of opening the doors, so go back outside - you can break\
      \ the windows through to the previous room as a shortcut if you're feeling destructive.\
      \ Back outside, look around. Raid the earth ledges around the pit for three\
      \ <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit</a>, a box of 50 Bullets and barrels containing two Clips. Look down\
      \ the pit; a short way down, you'll see a ledge with an illuminated tunnel leading\
      \ into the rock adjoining it.\n</p><p>The ledge is most safely accessed by walking\
      \ down the loose sloping plank on that side of the pit. Climb down a stretch\
      \ then fall the rest of the way. Once you are on the ledge, three Krall come\
      \ out of tunnel at the back. Kill them. Follow the tunnel into a small watery\
      \ cavern which has on its floor two Nali Healing Fruit and behind a rock 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards. A box of 50 Bullets on a taller rock can be accessed by jumping\
      \ up via this smaller rock.\n</p><p>Once you've raided the cavern for gear,\
      \ go over to the part of the pool where a metal pole sticks out of the water.\
      \ This pole marks a vertical shaft down beneath the surface; go for a swim.\
      \ At the bottom, the shaft turns into a long horizontal cistern with three <a\
      \ href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a> (note two Clips on the\
      \ right as it widens out); kill the fish then climb out at the other end of\
      \ the tank into a small room with a lift shaft at the centre.\n</p><p>Barrels\
      \ round the outside of this room contain three Clips. Collect, then turn the\
      \ handle at the side of the room to call the lift. It will come down with two\
      \ Krall on it, so kill them as they jump off. The lift will have gone up again\
      \ by the time they are dead, so call it again. This time, climb aboard via the\
      \ steps on the other side of the room and ride the lift to the top.\n</p><p>At\
      \ the top, you will come out on a raised ledge with a view of the locked structure\
      \ doors outside. There's a lever on this balcony, so press it and they open.\
      \ Drop down to floor level and go through the open doors into the area beyond.\
      \ You will be in an open area where two Krall jump down from viewing balconies;\
      \ kill them. While you are doing so, the doors close behind you. Explore the\
      \ area.\n</p><p>Near the back left corner, behind a low wall, are two cans of\
      \ 12 Eightballs. At the back, another pair of large double doors is locked.\
      \ On the left, a wide corridor leads into the rock. Enter the wide corridor.\
      \ Going round the first corner to the left, you will meet a <a href=\"/Brute\"\
      \ title=\"Brute\">Brute</a> coming the other way. Kill it. Then, go to the end\
      \ of the corridor and open the crates for two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards\
      \ and two Clips. The corridor terminates in a lever; press it and go back outside,\
      \ and you will find that the remaining double doors have opened.\n</p><p>Go\
      \ through the doors. A Brute has its back to you in the area beyond - kill it.\
      \ Then, open barrels on the left for two Clips and crates on either side of\
      \ the tower at the back to reveal a <a href=\"/Bio_Rifle\" title=\"Bio Rifle\"\
      >GES Biorifle</a> and a can of Tarydium Sludge. Go through the door in the tower\
      \ base and through to a small open-topped area with two Nali Healing Fruit flanking\
      \ another door. Collect of the fruit then open the next door and kill the <a\
      \ href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a>\
      \ that comes running from inside. Go inside yourself.\n</p><p>The corridor beyond\
      \ leads you into a flooded cellar room. You need to cross the water to the other\
      \ side, so go for a swim, either ignoring or killing the two Krall who snipe\
      \ from balconies on either side of this area. On the far side of the pool, climb\
      \ out via the steps and shoot the barrel on a nearby ledge for a can of Tarydium\
      \ Sludge.\n</p><p>Climb the remaining steps and go through the door on the right\
      \ to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translator_Messages\"\

      ''This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\nBeyond the [[Bluff Eversmoking]]\
      \ lies the Dasa Mountain Pass. A high narrow rock canyon is the gateway to some\
      \ massive and ancient Nali cellars, but the Dasa Mountain Pass and its cellars\
      \ suffer from the worst [[Skaarj]] infestation you've seen yet.\n\nYou start\
      \ at the bottom of the lift shaft from the previous map. Ahead is a double door;\
      \ go through it into a large hall partially converted by the Skaarj that is\
      \ being used as a storage room for large numbers of equipment crates from the\
      \ ISV-Kran.\n\nThe room seems empty but I assure you that it is not. Instead\
      \ of going up the centre of the storage facility, go round behind the first\
      \ crate on the left. You will meet in the shadows a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Guner|SkaarjGunner]]\
      \ with a [[Dispersion Pistol]] whom you should kill.\n\nMake your target a crate\
      \ further along at the back of the stacks whose back is open. Go towards it\
      \ - you may well be spotted by another SkaarjGunner with a Dispersion Pistol\
      \ on the way - and enter the open crate to grab a [[Shield Belt]]. Now go back\
      \ outside the crate stacks and continue up the centre of the room; you will\
      \ have to kill two more SkaarjGunners with Dispersion Pistols but eventually\
      \ you'll reach the far end of the hall.\n\nThe doors at the far end of the hall\
      \ are locked but it you look left from their position you'll see a lever in\
      \ a torchlit corner. Go between the pillars and press the lever to open the\
      \ doors. Then, go through the doors. They lead out into the mountain pass itself,\
      \ via a small foyer with two alcoves. Enter the alcove to the right to grab\
      \ an [[Enforcer|Automag]] and a [[Flare]] from a human corpse, then go out into\
      \ the pass itself.\n\nThis first stretch of pass is guardrd by a Krall whom\
      \ you should kill. When he is dead, open barrels for two Clips, then go round\
      \ the next corner and kill another Krall that attacks. In this area is a complicated\
      \ drawbridge currently in the raised position, a lever on the drawbridge itself,\
      \ and a log book on a pillar in an alcove to the right. Read the log book [1].\n\
      \nNow go and look across the deep pit the drawbridge crosses.\n\nLooking across\
      \ with the [[Sniper Rifle|Rifle]]'s zoom, you will see two Krall sentries patrolling\
      \ or shooting at you from ground level on the other side, and another on patrol\
      \ from a rooftop beyond. Decapitate all three then zoom back out again. Press\
      \ the lever on the drawbridge mechanism to lower it.\n\nCross the pit and try\
      \ the doors in the structure ahead; they are locked. So, go to the left and\
      \ go down a corridor into the rock there. You will shortly arrive in a room\
      \ where a Krall on guard ducks behind some barrels and shoots at you. Kill the\
      \ Krall and collect the two Clips from the barrels, then collect the [[Rocket\
      \ Launcher|Eightball Gun]] on offer in the same corner. Take the next corridor\
      \ out of the room, stopping by at an alcove where barrels contain another two\
      \ Clips. Follow the corridor to its conclusion and you will be in another room\
      \ where two Krall and a KrallElite sit playing dice. Blow them up with Eightballs.\n\
      \nCrates in corners on the left of the room reveal two Clips, a can of Tarydium\
      \ Sludge and an [[Assault Vest]]. There are two ASMD Cores in corners on the\
      \ right. When you've collected stuff, read the log books on the table at the\
      \ back [2-4].\n\nThat's all for this room, and it's revealed nothing of any\
      \ use in terms of opening the doors, so go back outside - you can break the\
      \ windows through to the previous room as a shortcut if you're feeling destructive.\
      \ Back outside, look around. Raid the earth ledges around the pit for three\
      \ [[Nali Healing Fruit]], a box of 50 Bullets and barrels containing two Clips.\
      \ Look down the pit; a short way down, you'll see a ledge with an illuminated\
      \ tunnel leading into the rock adjoining it.\n\nThe ledge is most safely accessed\
      \ by walking down the loose sloping plank on that side of the pit. Climb down\
      \ a stretch then fall the rest of the way. Once you are on the ledge, three\
      \ Krall come out of tunnel at the back. Kill them. Follow the tunnel into a\
      \ small watery cavern which has on its floor two Nali Healing Fruit and behind\
      \ a rock 40 Tarydium Shards. A box of 50 Bullets on a taller rock can be accessed\
      \ by jumping up via this smaller rock.\n\nOnce you've raided the cavern for\
      \ gear, go over to the part of the pool where a metal pole sticks out of the\
      \ water. This pole marks a vertical shaft down beneath the surface; go for a\
      \ swim. At the bottom, the shaft turns into a long horizontal cistern with three\
      \ [[Devilfish]] (note two Clips on the right as it widens out); kill the fish\
      \ then climb out at the other end of the tank into a small room with a lift\
      \ shaft at the centre.\n\nBarrels round the outside of this room contain three\
      \ Clips. Collect, then turn the handle at the side of the room to call the lift.\
      \ It will come down with two Krall on it, so kill them as they jump off. The\
      \ lift will have gone up again by the time they are dead, so call it again.\
      \ This time, climb aboard via the steps on the other side of the room and ride\
      \ the lift to the top.\n\nAt the top, you will come out on a raised ledge with\
      \ a view of the locked structure doors outside. There's a lever on this balcony,\
      \ so press it and they open. Drop down to floor level and go through the open\
      \ doors into the area beyond. You will be in an open area where two Krall jump\
      \ down from viewing balconies; kill them. While you are doing so, the doors\
      \ close behind you. Explore the area.\n\nNear the back left corner, behind a\
      \ low wall, are two cans of 12 Eightballs. At the back, another pair of large\
      \ double doors is locked. On the left, a wide corridor leads into the rock.\
      \ Enter the wide corridor. Going round the first corner to the left, you will\
      \ meet a [[Brute]] coming the other way. Kill it. Then, go to the end of the\
      \ corridor and open the crates for two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and two\
      \ Clips. The corridor terminates in a lever; press it and go back outside, and\
      \ you will find that the remaining double doors have opened.\n\nGo through the\
      \ doors. A Brute has its back to you in the area beyond - kill it. Then, open\
      \ barrels on the left for two Clips and crates on either side of the tower at\
      \ the back to reveal a [[Bio Rifle|GES Biorifle]] and a can of Tarydium Sludge.\
      \ Go through the door in the tower base and through to a small open-topped area\
      \ with two Nali Healing Fruit flanking another door. Collect of the fruit then\
      \ open the next door and kill the [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]]\
      \ that comes running from inside. Go inside yourself.\n\nThe corridor beyond\
      \ leads you into a flooded cellar room. You need to cross the water to the other\
      \ side, so go for a swim, either ignoring or killing the two Krall who snipe\
      \ from balconies on either side of this area. On the far side of the pool, climb\
      \ out via the steps and shoot the barrel on a nearby ledge for a can of Tarydium\
      \ Sludge.\n\nClimb the remaining steps and go through the door on the right\
      \ to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"Bridge Foreman Khan Vhranna:\
