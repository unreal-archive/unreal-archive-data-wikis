      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>You're back on the planet. Looking up as the shuttle pulls away above,\
      \ you suddenly feel very alone. Check your inventory - no <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a>\
      \ as promised, but you do have the self-recharging <a href=\"/SCUBA_Gear#Other_Appearances\"\
      \ title=\"SCUBA Gear\">Marine SCUBA Gear</a>, a <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\"\
      \ title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a> and a <a href=\"/Universal_Translator\"\
      \ title=\"Universal Translator\">Universal Translator</a>.\n</p><p>You start\
      \ on a raised platform in a tall bay built out of materials resembling those\
      \ you saw in the <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> mining bunkers\
      \ back at <a href=\"/NyLeve%27s_Falls\" title=\"NyLeve's Falls\">NyLeve's Falls</a>\
      \ when you first landed on this planet. Look around.\n</p><p>To the left, a\
      \ box top jumpable to from this platform carries a Clip, and to the right a\
      \ similar box top carries two <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flares</a>.\
      \ Wooden crates on the floor behind the starting position reveal a Clip. Collect\
      \ the gear, then go out through a double door which was ahead as you started.\n\
      Beyond the door, a short corridor leads into another room where a wooden crate\
      \ reveals a Clip. You can go behind a box on the left for a useful <a href=\"\
      /Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a> as well. Then, look around;\
      \ there are two exits ahead in the form of sets of double doors. Go through\
      \ the left doors into a small closed chamber where wooden crates reveal a Flare\
      \ and you can collect an <a href=\"/Enforcer\" title=\"Enforcer\">Automag</a>\
      \ from on top of a small table. This room also contains a rickety window through\
      \ to the corridor beyond the right-hand exit from the previous room. Shoot the\
      \ window to pieces and hop through to gain access to the corridor the fun way.\
      \ Within the corridor, go and read the red sign on the far wall to find out\
      \ where you are. It beeps a Universal Translator message [1].\n</p><p>Go to\
      \ the left and round the corner. Two <a href=\"/Bandages\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Bandages\">Bandages</a> lie beyond the next box on the right as you\
      \ do so. As you turn the corner, you will see that the bunker leads outside\
      \ towards a Nali Hut, and as you approach the exit, some UMS logistics drop\
      \ boxes outside the bunker collapse to reveal some gear. Go outside to collect\
      \ your first shipment of stuff from the military; you will find a 50 bullet\
      \ CAR Clip (Combat Assault Rifle ammo) and a useful <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a>.\
      \ Then, go round the front of the Nali hut to see where you are.\n</p><p>Mind\
      \ the <a href=\"/Nali_Rabbit\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nali Rabbit\">Nali\
      \ Rabbit</a> as you go around the front of the house, then step into the hut\
      \ and prepare to meet your first opposition in the form of a <a href=\"/Tentacle\"\
      \ title=\"Tentacle\">Tentacle</a> attached to the ceiling. In the hut, a wooden\
      \ crate on the table can be shot open for a Health Pack. Leave the hut, noting\
      \ as you go the entrance to a base ahead to the left, then veer off towards\
      \ the cliff on the right. Go along the cliff and you will find a pool; dive\
      \ into the pool and have a swim. A human corpse has a Clip nearby and also a\
      \ log [2].\n</p><p>When you have collected the Clip, climb out of the pool at\
      \ the end where the bank is shallow. Motice how your Marine SCUBA Gear recharges.\
      \ Then, go round the back of the large rock on the left and approach the base\
      \ entrance. As you pass a palm tree, you should notice a <a href=\"/Brute\"\
      \ title=\"Brute\">LesserBrute</a> on guard - take it by surprise with secondary\
      \ fire of your Combat Assault Rifle.\n</p><p>Before entering the facility, go\
      \ round to the left of the medium sized rock nearest the entrance, and you will\
      \ see that one face of it is shallow enough to climb. Do so, and you will find\
      \ a human corpse on top. Read his log [3].\n</p><p>Look towards the base entrance\
      \ and to the left. There's a wooden crate behind some boxes there; it contains\
      \ a Health Pack if you need it. Then, go to the base entrance and step inside.\n\
      </p><p>Inside, a ramp goes up to a door guarded by a LesserBrute. Kill the LesserBrute,\
      \ then investigate the boxes to the right of the ramp. The first one is open,\
      \ containing an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault\
      \ Vest\">Assault Vest</a>. You can go behind that box for two Clips. If you\
      \ go right to the back, you will find yet another dead man with log [4].\n</p><p>Go\
      \ back to the base of the ramp and climb it. A sign at the top identifies this\
      \ structure [5].\n</p><p>Go through the door here. You come out in a room with\
      \ a mechanical platform and tunnel on the left, and a button on the right. Ahead,\
      \ you can open a wooden crate for a Clip, and go behind a box to the right in\
      \ the corner for an ASMD Core.\n</p><p>Press the button and step on to the mechanical\
      \ platform. It takes you down through the tunnel and into a room at the bottom\
      \ where you will be met by a LesserBrute. Kill it then descend the ramp towards\
      \ the door ahead, collecting the Clip from the recess to the right of the ramp.\
      \ Go through the door.\n</p><p>The room beyond, along a short corridor to the\
      \ left, has a ramp down towards the great outdoors. First, read the sign up\
      \ here [6].\n</p><p>Look around for gear. A wooden crate jumpable to on boxes\
      \ to the left contains a Health Pack, plus two Bandages and a Clip are hidden\
      \ between the first box and the raised walkway. Collect the gear as appropriate,\
      \ then go outside. As you emerge, a fully-sized Brute comes from behind a box\
      \ on the right, so keep your guard up.\n</p><p>You can explore the immediate\
      \ outdoor vicinity. You are at one end of a valley; a wooden crate behind boxes\
      \ on the left reveals a Health Pack, while wooden crates by a lamp post on the\
      \ right reveal a Clip. Continue down the valley, and just before it opens out\
      \ into a broad downhill slope, you will come to three UMS logistics drop boxes\
      \ which can be shot open for two CAR Clips snd another Combat Assault Rifle.\
      \ Head off down the slope, but watch out because a Brute sees you from ahead\
      \ and starts firing rockets, whilst a <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"Manta\">Manta</a>\
      \ swoops down from atop of a tall rock behind. Kill them both, then carry on\
      \ down the slope.\n</p><p>At the bottom there is another stack of boxes, nearby\
      \ where the Brute was standing when it spotted you. Another wooden crate behind\
      \ the boxes there contains a Health Pack. The path leads off at a shallower\
      \ gradient now, to the left of a chasm with a waterfall cascading down. Go along\
      \ this wide ledge, and shortly you will come to a Nali hut. Go inside it, and\
      \ you will find a Nali - leave him alone. Open barrels for a Clip. There's also\
      \ a dead man with a log [7].\n</p><p>When you're done, step out of the hut and\
      \ continue along the ledge.\n</p><p>The ledge follows the cliff round, continuing\
      \ past the waterfall, then goes up a short slope as the waterfall chasm ends,\
      \ arriving on a small rise with two Nali huts. Go to the right of the first\
      \ rock mesa and into the hut on that side of the area. Mind the Tentacle within.\
      \ Inside, open barrels in one corner for a Flare.\n</p><p>Go out of the hut\
      \ and to the left, approaching the next Nali hut there. Go inside, killing another\
      \ Tentacle, for two Bandages and a Clip near a corpse. Read the unfortunate\
      \ woman's log [8].\n</p><p>Leave the hut. Ahead there is another canyon, with\
      \ a ledge continuing along this time to the right. To the left is another bunker\
      \ entrance, but first go a short way off to the right for a UMS drop box containing\
      \ a CAR Clip. When you have the ammo, approach the bunker entrance. Kill the\
      \ LesserBrute on patrol there, then enter the bunker corridor (there's a <a\
      \ href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a>\
      \ behind boxes to the right if you need it). Go into the main bunker room.\n\
      </p><p>To the left is a lift shaft down with no lift currently present, and\
      \ a button. Go behind boxes at the back of the room first for a box of 50 Bullets,\
      \ then go to the lift shaft and press the button. Shortly, a lift comes up and\
      \ stops. Climb aboard, then ride the lift as it returns automatically to the\
      \ lower level. Enter the room at the bottom. An ASMD Core is behind the first\
      \ box on the right. Further into the room, you will see a doorway and corridor\
      \ to the right, and also a shadowy corner to the left. Go into the shadowy corner\
      \ and go round behind a pillar to collect an Assault Vest there.\n</p><p>Select\
      \ your Combat Assault Rifle now and go through the doorway, heading up the corridor.\
      \ As you go to the left of a box in the corner, you will be sighted and attacked\
      \ by a large <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\">Behemoth</a>. Use the box for\
      \ cover and pummel it with primary fire until it dies.\n</p><p>Go into the room\
      \ the Behemoth was guarding, and shoot open a wooden crate at the far side.\
      \ Go into that area for two Clips. Then, look around the room. There are two\
      \ sets of doors from the room, one to each side. Open the one that was to the\
      \ right as you entered; you will see a rail over a slime pool beyond. There's\
      \ a cart at the far end. So, back out into the Behemoth room and look for a\
      \ red button on the wall at this end. Press it, then return through the doors\
      \ to the slime pool. While you wait for the cart to make its slow progress towards\
      \ you, destroy the explosive barrels lining the walls.\n</p><p>When the cart\
      \ arrives, step on it. It automatically returns to the far side, with you on\
      \ board. Once there, you will be at another set of doors. Go through into the\
      \ bunker beyond and kill the LesserBrute on guard. Inside the bunker, there\
      \ is a door immediately to the left. Go through into a room with a small table\
      \ and a window similar to a room like this at the start of the map. Collect\
      \ the Automag and Clip from the table then break the window to go back out into\
      \ the main bunker.\nThe exit from this bunker is to the left, but first go to\
      \ the right and behind boxes back in the main bunker room for an ASMD Core.\
      \ With that, return towards the exit, reading first the sign on the right [9].\n\
      </p><p>Go out through the exit; you are at the bottom of the waterfall canyon,\
      \ with the waterfall cascading down on the left into a pool. A bridge crosses\
      \ over the pool to the next stretch of land, guarded by a LesserBrute. Before\
      \ moving on, go round behind to the left of the bunker entrance to find a wooden\
      \ crate with a Health Pack. Collect, then come back out and go towards the bridge,\
      \ killing the LesserBrute as you do so.\n</p><p>The water will reveal nothing\
      \ useful, so stay on dry land. Cross the bridge and head up the canyon, arriving\
      \ at another bunker entrance at the far end. A wooden crate to the right of\
      \ that entrance reveals another Health Pack. Enter the bunker and kill the LesserBrute\
      \ who comes out from the right, then go between boxes on the left for two Bandages.\
      \ Go round to the right inside the bunker and through doors at the end into\
      \ the next area, but beware the Tentacle lurking behind a ceiling beam beyond.\
      \ Go to the back of the room and open wooden crates for a Health Pack and a\
      \ Flare, then go to the leftermost end of this room to find a small table with\
      \ another ASMD Core and at last an <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"Shock Rifle\"\
      >ASMD</a>. Collect the gun.\n</p><p>Break open the window there as a shortcut,\
      \ then jump through and leave the facility. Time to retrace your steps, so go\
      \ back along the waterfall canyon, crossing the bridge and re-entering the facility\
      \ at the end. In the Terra-Mina bunker, go back to the doors by the slime pool.\
      \ Press a button on the left before the doors (activating the cart), then go\
      \ through and riding the cart back over the slime pool. Go back through into\
      \ the Behemoth room.\n</p><p>Go straight across the Behemoth room and through\
      \ the doors at the far end. Beyond, open a wooden crate for a Health Pack and\
      \ then follow the corridor round to leave the bunker into the other canyon you\
      \ saw from above. This canyon stretches off to the left, but first before following\
      \ it open the UMS drop box ahead for a CAR Clip then go round to the right.\
      \ Follow the base of the end cliff of this canyon until you go behind boxes\
      \ and find a wooden crate which contains a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a>. Collect it,\
      \ then look up the canyon.\n</p><p>Go up the canyon. As you approach a strangely\
      \ lit Nali hut at the far end, a LesserBrute comes out from behind some boxes.\
      \ Kill it, then enter the hut. Inside the hut there is a box of 50 Bullets on\
      \ a table to the left. A barrel on the right past a dead Nali contains a Flare,\
      \ and there's a Nali Healing Fruit at the back. Collect the gear then leave\
      \ the hut - go round behind the hut to find a corridor entrance to a bunker\
      \ where a LesserBrute is on guard. Inside the bunker you will find a lift ahead.\
      \ Go round behind boxes on the right, killing a LesserBrute who is on guard,\
      \ and opening a wooden crate for a Health Pack. Go behind a box on the other\
      \ side of the room for a Clip, then approach the lift.\n</p><p>Press the button\
      \ by the lift, then step aboard. Ride it to the top, and step out onto the outside\
      \ ground at the top. You have come out some way up the valley from where you\
      \ went down the first lift, but there's nothing of interest that you missed\
      \ along the ledge in between. Here by this bunker entrance is a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit. Collect it then go to the left of the boxes ahead, where there is a\
      \ Clip but also a LesserBrute.\n</p><p>So, head on up the valley to the left.\
      \ The valley goes up a slope, passing three UMS drop boxes along the way which\
      \ contain CAR Clips. Shortly you will arrive at the top of the valley.\n</p><p>There's\
      \ another bunker entrance at the top. Before entering, boxes on either side\
      \ of the entrance hand behind them an ASMD Core and 40 Tarydium Shards. When\
      \ you've collected the gear, go to the entrance itself - you may be alarmed\
      \ to see two dead Brutes - what did that?\n</p><p>Enter the facility. A wooden\
      \ crate on the right contains a Health Pack. Beyond that, there's a sign [10].\n\
      </p><p>Go on beyond the sign and round behind the box there for a box of 50\
      \ Bullets. Then, go to the left. You will find two locked sets of doors and\
      \ a button. Press the button; the doors nearest the button slide open, revealing\
      \ a storage facility beyond where a similar button explodes as you enter. The\
      \ doors close behind you, locking you in... you might want to save your game\
      \ now.\n</p><p>The storage facility is a ring-shaped complex with pillars and\
      \ boxes stacked around the place getting in the way. Select your Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle and go to the left, heading round the facility in a clockwise direction.\
      \ Shortly, you will round a corner and see (or hear if you don't get far enough\
      \ around) five small reptilian creatures swarm on to and kill an unfortunate\
      \ Brute. Then, the five fast and voracious <a href=\"/Predator\" title=\"Predator\"\
      >Predators</a> come after you. Back off at a run, firing your Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle constantly - don't get cornered - until all five Predators are dead.\
      \ Once you are sure that you are safe, start again going clockwise around the\
      \ facility.\n</p><p>As you approach the point where you were spotted by the\
      \ Predators, you will see an ASMD Core behind a box to the right and also a\
      \ ramp to the left. Collect the core then go up the ramp.\n</p><p>The ramp leads\
      \ up to a low balcony above the facility. At the far end of the balcony are\
      \ three Bandages, two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and a button. Look clockwise\
      \ down the facility from here, and you will see some shut doors. Press the button\
      \ and they open (revealing the level exit), but don't go through them yet!\n\
      </p><p>If you were looking at the exit doors, then you will probably have seen\
      \ the <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> on top of the box below.\
      \ Go down to the floor via the box to collect the Stinger. Go clockwise down\
      \ the facility, going past the doors you opened and continuing round (via a\
      \ box of 50 Bullets on the right) until you reach the doors by which you initially\
      \ entered the facility, which have now re-opened. Go out into the foyer beyond,\
      \ and you will see that the previously locked doors to the right have opened\
      \ too.\n</p><p>Go through the newly opened doors and into the corridor beyond,\
      \ winding round the boxes in the way until you arrive in the next room. Said\
      \ room has a lift upwards, a wooden crate containing a Health Pack on the left,\
      \ and a box of 50 Bullets on the right. Collect the gear, then approach the\
      \ lift. Press the button by the lift and step aboard. Ride it to the top of\
      \ its shaft, and you will come out in another corridor. Follow the corridor\
      \ right round; you will come out via a tunnel on a muddy plateau high up on\
      \ the cliffs above the valley, which is guarded by a SkaarjWarrior.\n</p><p>To\
      \ the right, a small UMS ship similar in appearance to the hulk of the Vortex\
      \ Rikers has crashed on top of the cliff, carving a trench out of the ground.\
      \ Go along this trench, shooting some wooden crates open from behind a box for\
      \ two Health Packs. Follow the trench along; you will see a gap beneath the\
      \ left of the ship that forms a tunnel through to another part of the plateau;\
      \ go through it.\n</p><p>This part of the plateau is also guarded by a SkaarjWarrior;\
      \ kill it. Explore the plateau. A UMS drop box contains a CAR Clip. A human\
      \ form sits slumped against a lamp post on a metal crate with his possessions\
      \ strewn around him; an Automag, a Clip and a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>. As you approach him to\
      \ read his log, he convulses and dies [11].\n</p><p>The unfortunate pilot Worch\
      \ is actually back at the other end of this plateau, draped over the cliff edge.\
      \ You can read his log if you care to do so [12].\n</p><p>All done here. Return\
      \ through the gaps to either side of the ship and go back into the bunker corridor\
      \ on the first plateau. Press the button there to call the lift, then step aboard.\
      \ Having ridden it back down and returned to the foyer, go back into the storage\
      \ facility. Going anticlockwise, when you find those doors that you opened earlier,\
      \ go through them to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\nYou're back on the planet. Looking\
      \ up as the shuttle pulls away above, you suddenly feel very alone. Check your\
      \ inventory - no [[Combat Assault Rifle]] as promised, but you do have the self-recharging\
      \ [[SCUBA Gear#Other_Appearances|Marine SCUBA Gear]], a [[Dispersion Pistol]]\
      \ and a [[Universal Translator]].\n\nYou start on a raised platform in a tall\
      \ bay built out of materials resembling those you saw in the [[Skaarj]] mining\
      \ bunkers back at [[NyLeve's Falls]] when you first landed on this planet. Look\
      \ around.\n\nTo the left, a box top jumpable to from this platform carries a\
      \ Clip, and to the right a similar box top carries two [[Flare|Flares]]. Wooden\
      \ crates on the floor behind the starting position reveal a Clip. Collect the\
      \ gear, then go out through a double door which was ahead as you started.\n\
      Beyond the door, a short corridor leads into another room where a wooden crate\
      \ reveals a Clip. You can go behind a box on the left for a useful [[Flashlight]]\
      \ as well. Then, look around; there are two exits ahead in the form of sets\
      \ of double doors. Go through the left doors into a small closed chamber where\
      \ wooden crates reveal a Flare and you can collect an [[Enforcer|Automag]] from\
      \ on top of a small table. This room also contains a rickety window through\
      \ to the corridor beyond the right-hand exit from the previous room. Shoot the\
      \ window to pieces and hop through to gain access to the corridor the fun way.\
      \ Within the corridor, go and read the red sign on the far wall to find out\
      \ where you are. It beeps a Universal Translator message [1].\n\nGo to the left\
      \ and round the corner. Two [[Bandages]] lie beyond the next box on the right\
      \ as you do so. As you turn the corner, you will see that the bunker leads outside\
      \ towards a Nali Hut, and as you approach the exit, some UMS logistics drop\
      \ boxes outside the bunker collapse to reveal some gear. Go outside to collect\
      \ your first shipment of stuff from the military; you will find a 50 bullet\
      \ CAR Clip (Combat Assault Rifle ammo) and a useful [[Combat Assault Rifle]].\
      \ Then, go round the front of the Nali hut to see where you are.\n\nMind the\
      \ [[Nali Rabbit]] as you go around the front of the house, then step into the\
      \ hut and prepare to meet your first opposition in the form of a [[Tentacle]]\
      \ attached to the ceiling. In the hut, a wooden crate on the table can be shot\
      \ open for a Health Pack. Leave the hut, noting as you go the entrance to a\
      \ base ahead to the left, then veer off towards the cliff on the right. Go along\
      \ the cliff and you will find a pool; dive into the pool and have a swim. A\
      \ human corpse has a Clip nearby and also a log [2].\n\nWhen you have collected\
      \ the Clip, climb out of the pool at the end where the bank is shallow. Motice\
      \ how your Marine SCUBA Gear recharges. Then, go round the back of the large\
      \ rock on the left and approach the base entrance. As you pass a palm tree,\
      \ you should notice a [[Brute|LesserBrute]] on guard - take it by surprise with\
      \ secondary fire of your Combat Assault Rifle.\n\nBefore entering the facility,\
      \ go round to the left of the medium sized rock nearest the entrance, and you\
      \ will see that one face of it is shallow enough to climb. Do so, and you will\
      \ find a human corpse on top. Read his log [3].\n\nLook towards the base entrance\
      \ and to the left. There's a wooden crate behind some boxes there; it contains\
      \ a Health Pack if you need it. Then, go to the base entrance and step inside.\n\
      \nInside, a ramp goes up to a door guarded by a LesserBrute. Kill the LesserBrute,\
      \ then investigate the boxes to the right of the ramp. The first one is open,\
      \ containing an [[Assault Vest]]. You can go behind that box for two Clips.\
      \ If you go right to the back, you will find yet another dead man with log [4].\n\
      \nGo back to the base of the ramp and climb it. A sign at the top identifies\
      \ this structure [5].\n\nGo through the door here. You come out in a room with\
      \ a mechanical platform and tunnel on the left, and a button on the right. Ahead,\
      \ you can open a wooden crate for a Clip, and go behind a box to the right in\
      \ the corner for an ASMD Core.\n\nPress the button and step on to the mechanical\
      \ platform. It takes you down through the tunnel and into a room at the bottom\
      \ where you will be met by a LesserBrute. Kill it then descend the ramp towards\
      \ the door ahead, collecting the Clip from the recess to the right of the ramp.\
      \ Go through the door.\n\nThe room beyond, along a short corridor to the left,\
      \ has a ramp down towards the great outdoors. First, read the sign up here [6].\n\
      \nLook around for gear. A wooden crate jumpable to on boxes to the left contains\
      \ a Health Pack, plus two Bandages and a Clip are hidden between the first box\
      \ and the raised walkway. Collect the gear as appropriate, then go outside.\
      \ As you emerge, a fully-sized Brute comes from behind a box on the right, so\
      \ keep your guard up.\n\nYou can explore the immediate outdoor vicinity. You\
      \ are at one end of a valley; a wooden crate behind boxes on the left reveals\
      \ a Health Pack, while wooden crates by a lamp post on the right reveal a Clip.\
      \ Continue down the valley, and just before it opens out into a broad downhill\
      \ slope, you will come to three UMS logistics drop boxes which can be shot open\
      \ for two CAR Clips snd another Combat Assault Rifle. Head off down the slope,\
      \ but watch out because a Brute sees you from ahead and starts firing rockets,\
      \ whilst a [[Manta]] swoops down from atop of a tall rock behind. Kill them\
      \ both, then carry on down the slope.\n\nAt the bottom there is another stack\
      \ of boxes, nearby where the Brute was standing when it spotted you. Another\
      \ wooden crate behind the boxes there contains a Health Pack. The path leads\
      \ off at a shallower gradient now, to the left of a chasm with a waterfall cascading\
      \ down. Go along this wide ledge, and shortly you will come to a Nali hut. Go\
      \ inside it, and you will find a Nali - leave him alone. Open barrels for a\
      \ Clip. There's also a dead man with a log [7].\n\nWhen you're done, step out\
      \ of the hut and continue along the ledge.\n\nThe ledge follows the cliff round,\
      \ continuing past the waterfall, then goes up a short slope as the waterfall\
      \ chasm ends, arriving on a small rise with two Nali huts. Go to the right of\
      \ the first rock mesa and into the hut on that side of the area. Mind the Tentacle\
      \ within. Inside, open barrels in one corner for a Flare.\n\nGo out of the hut\
      \ and to the left, approaching the next Nali hut there. Go inside, killing another\
      \ Tentacle, for two Bandages and a Clip near a corpse. Read the unfortunate\
      \ woman's log [8].\n\nLeave the hut. Ahead there is another canyon, with a ledge\
      \ continuing along this time to the right. To the left is another bunker entrance,\
      \ but first go a short way off to the right for a UMS drop box containing a\
      \ CAR Clip. When you have the ammo, approach the bunker entrance. Kill the LesserBrute\
      \ on patrol there, then enter the bunker corridor (there's a [[Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit]] behind boxes to the right if you need it). Go into the main bunker\
      \ room.\n\nTo the left is a lift shaft down with no lift currently present,\
      \ and a button. Go behind boxes at the back of the room first for a box of 50\
      \ Bullets, then go to the lift shaft and press the button. Shortly, a lift comes\
      \ up and stops. Climb aboard, then ride the lift as it returns automatically\
      \ to the lower level. Enter the room at the bottom. An ASMD Core is behind the\
      \ first box on the right. Further into the room, you will see a doorway and\
      \ corridor to the right, and also a shadowy corner to the left. Go into the\
      \ shadowy corner and go round behind a pillar to collect an Assault Vest there.\n\
      \nSelect your Combat Assault Rifle now and go through the doorway, heading up\
      \ the corridor. As you go to the left of a box in the corner, you will be sighted\
      \ and attacked by a large [[Brute|Behemoth]]. Use the box for cover and pummel\
      \ it with primary fire until it dies.\n\nGo into the room the Behemoth was guarding,\
      \ and shoot open a wooden crate at the far side. Go into that area for two Clips.\
      \ Then, look around the room. There are two sets of doors from the room, one\
      \ to each side. Open the one that was to the right as you entered; you will\
      \ see a rail over a slime pool beyond. There's a cart at the far end. So, back\
      \ out into the Behemoth room and look for a red button on the wall at this end.\
      \ Press it, then return through the doors to the slime pool. While you wait\
      \ for the cart to make its slow progress towards you, destroy the explosive\
      \ barrels lining the walls.\n\nWhen the cart arrives, step on it. It automatically\
      \ returns to the far side, with you on board. Once there, you will be at another\
      \ set of doors. Go through into the bunker beyond and kill the LesserBrute on\
      \ guard. Inside the bunker, there is a door immediately to the left. Go through\
      \ into a room with a small table and a window similar to a room like this at\
      \ the start of the map. Collect the Automag and Clip from the table then break\
      \ the window to go back out into the main bunker.\nThe exit from this bunker\
      \ is to the left, but first go to the right and behind boxes back in the main\
      \ bunker room for an ASMD Core. With that, return towards the exit, reading\
      \ first the sign on the right [9].\n\nGo out through the exit; you are at the\
      \ bottom of the waterfall canyon, with the waterfall cascading down on the left\
      \ into a pool. A bridge crosses over the pool to the next stretch of land, guarded\
      \ by a LesserBrute. Before moving on, go round behind to the left of the bunker\
      \ entrance to find a wooden crate with a Health Pack. Collect, then come back\
      \ out and go towards the bridge, killing the LesserBrute as you do so.\n\nThe\
      \ water will reveal nothing useful, so stay on dry land. Cross the bridge and\
      \ head up the canyon, arriving at another bunker entrance at the far end. A\
      \ wooden crate to the right of that entrance reveals another Health Pack. Enter\
      \ the bunker and kill the LesserBrute who comes out from the right, then go\
      \ between boxes on the left for two Bandages. Go round to the right inside the\
      \ bunker and through doors at the end into the next area, but beware the Tentacle\
      \ lurking behind a ceiling beam beyond. Go to the back of the room and open\
      \ wooden crates for a Health Pack and a Flare, then go to the leftermost end\
      \ of this room to find a small table with another ASMD Core and at last an [[Shock\
      \ Rifle|ASMD]]. Collect the gun.\n\nBreak open the window there as a shortcut,\
      \ then jump through and leave the facility. Time to retrace your steps, so go\
      \ back along the waterfall canyon, crossing the bridge and re-entering the facility\
      \ at the end. In the Terra-Mina bunker, go back to the doors by the slime pool.\
      \ Press a button on the left before the doors (activating the cart), then go\
      \ through and riding the cart back over the slime pool. Go back through into\
      \ the Behemoth room.\n\nGo straight across the Behemoth room and through the\
      \ doors at the far end. Beyond, open a wooden crate for a Health Pack and then\
      \ follow the corridor round to leave the bunker into the other canyon you saw\
      \ from above. This canyon stretches off to the left, but first before following\
      \ it open the UMS drop box ahead for a CAR Clip then go round to the right.\
      \ Follow the base of the end cliff of this canyon until you go behind boxes\
      \ and find a wooden crate which contains a [[Super Health Pack]]. Collect it,\
      \ then look up the canyon.\n\nGo up the canyon. As you approach a strangely\
      \ lit Nali hut at the far end, a LesserBrute comes out from behind some boxes.\
      \ Kill it, then enter the hut. Inside the hut there is a box of 50 Bullets on\
      \ a table to the left. A barrel on the right past a dead Nali contains a Flare,\
      \ and there's a Nali Healing Fruit at the back. Collect the gear then leave\
      \ the hut - go round behind the hut to find a corridor entrance to a bunker\
      \ where a LesserBrute is on guard. Inside the bunker you will find a lift ahead.\
      \ Go round behind boxes on the right, killing a LesserBrute who is on guard,\
      \ and opening a wooden crate for a Health Pack. Go behind a box on the other\
      \ side of the room for a Clip, then approach the lift.\n\nPress the button by\
      \ the lift, then step aboard. Ride it to the top, and step out onto the outside\
      \ ground at the top. You have come out some way up the valley from where you\
      \ went down the first lift, but there's nothing of interest that you missed\
      \ along the ledge in between. Here by this bunker entrance is a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit. Collect it then go to the left of the boxes ahead, where there is a\
      \ Clip but also a LesserBrute.\n\nSo, head on up the valley to the left. The\
      \ valley goes up a slope, passing three UMS drop boxes along the way which contain\
      \ CAR Clips. Shortly you will arrive at the top of the valley.\n\nThere's another\
      \ bunker entrance at the top. Before entering, boxes on either side of the entrance\
      \ hand behind them an ASMD Core and 40 Tarydium Shards. When you've collected\
      \ the gear, go to the entrance itself - you may be alarmed to see two dead Brutes\
      \ - what did that?\n\nEnter the facility. A wooden crate on the right contains\
      \ a Health Pack. Beyond that, there's a sign [10].\n\nGo on beyond the sign\
      \ and round behind the box there for a box of 50 Bullets. Then, go to the left.\
      \ You will find two locked sets of doors and a button. Press the button; the\
      \ doors nearest the button slide open, revealing a storage facility beyond where\
      \ a similar button explodes as you enter. The doors close behind you, locking\
      \ you in... you might want to save your game now.\n\nThe storage facility is\
      \ a ring-shaped complex with pillars and boxes stacked around the place getting\
      \ in the way. Select your Combat Assault Rifle and go to the left, heading round\
      \ the facility in a clockwise direction. Shortly, you will round a corner and\
      \ see (or hear if you don't get far enough around) five small reptilian creatures\
      \ swarm on to and kill an unfortunate Brute. Then, the five fast and voracious\
      \ [[Predator|Predators]] come after you. Back off at a run, firing your Combat\
      \ Assault Rifle constantly - don't get cornered - until all five Predators are\
      \ dead. Once you are sure that you are safe, start again going clockwise around\
      \ the facility.\n\nAs you approach the point where you were spotted by the Predators,\
      \ you will see an ASMD Core behind a box to the right and also a ramp to the\
      \ left. Collect the core then go up the ramp.\n\nThe ramp leads up to a low\
      \ balcony above the facility. At the far end of the balcony are three Bandages,\
      \ two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and a button. Look clockwise down the facility\
      \ from here, and you will see some shut doors. Press the button and they open\
      \ (revealing the level exit), but don't go through them yet!\n\nIf you were\
      \ looking at the exit doors, then you will probably have seen the [[Stinger]]\
      \ on top of the box below. Go down to the floor via the box to collect the Stinger.\
      \ Go clockwise down the facility, going past the doors you opened and continuing\
      \ round (via a box of 50 Bullets on the right) until you reach the doors by\
      \ which you initially entered the facility, which have now re-opened. Go out\
      \ into the foyer beyond, and you will see that the previously locked doors to\
      \ the right have opened too.\n\nGo through the newly opened doors and into the\
      \ corridor beyond, winding round the boxes in the way until you arrive in the\
      \ next room. Said room has a lift upwards, a wooden crate containing a Health\
      \ Pack on the left, and a box of 50 Bullets on the right. Collect the gear,\
      \ then approach the lift. Press the button by the lift and step aboard. Ride\
      \ it to the top of its shaft, and you will come out in another corridor. Follow\
      \ the corridor right round; you will come out via a tunnel on a muddy plateau\
      \ high up on the cliffs above the valley, which is guarded by a SkaarjWarrior.\n\
      \nTo the right, a small UMS ship similar in appearance to the hulk of the Vortex\
      \ Rikers has crashed on top of the cliff, carving a trench out of the ground.\
      \ Go along this trench, shooting some wooden crates open from behind a box for\
      \ two Health Packs. Follow the trench along; you will see a gap beneath the\
      \ left of the ship that forms a tunnel through to another part of the plateau;\
      \ go through it.\n\nThis part of the plateau is also guarded by a SkaarjWarrior;\
      \ kill it. Explore the plateau. A UMS drop box contains a CAR Clip. A human\
      \ form sits slumped against a lamp post on a metal crate with his possessions\
      \ strewn around him; an Automag, a Clip and a [[Shield Belt]]. As you approach\
      \ him to read his log, he convulses and dies [11].\n\nThe unfortunate pilot\
      \ Worch is actually back at the other end of this plateau, draped over the cliff\
      \ edge. You can read his log if you care to do so [12].\n\nAll done here. Return\
      \ through the gaps to either side of the ship and go back into the bunker corridor\
      \ on the first plateau. Press the button there to call the lift, then step aboard.\
      \ Having ridden it back down and returned to the foyer, go back into the storage\
      \ facility. Going anticlockwise, when you find those doors that you opened earlier,\
      \ go through them to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"Terra-Emi\
