      \ also known as Facing Worlds or simply \"Face\", is a capture the flag (CTF)\
      \ map from Unreal Tournament.\n</p><p>It consists of an asteroid and two towers,\
      \ each belonging to each team. The central part of the Asteroid holds a Big\
      \ Keg O' Health.\n</p><p>The bases themselves have the flag inside of them,\
      \ and three teleporters guiding to three different spots. The lower level holds\
      \ the Flag, a Shock Rifle and a Rocket Launcher. There's also a platform holding\
      \ a Damage Ampifier.\n</p><p>With the entrance to each base being at the south,\
      \ the west teleporter ends in a small chamber holding a Redeemer. The east teleport\
      \ ends in another chamber, above the Redeemer chamber, this time holding a Sniper\
      \ Rifle. And the third teleporter is placed right in the center of the lower\
      \ area, and ends in the top of the tower, where players can find another Sniper\
      \ Rifle and an Armor vest. Outside of the bases, players can find some weapons\
      \ and ammo as well.\n</p><p>It is the most well-known map in the game, liked\
      \ by many for its simple, symmetric design, and similarly reviled by some for\
      \ its exploitative design that appeals to snipers and campers.\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ CTF-Face was inspired by a community map for Unreal, which consisted of 2\
      \ bases (with small towers) linked by a bridge. Inoxx, however, chose to make\
      \ the towers taller to make sniping a major element in the map<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\"\
      \ class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>.</li>\n\
      <li> The original design for the map had lifts, no middle sniping area nor Redeemer\
      \ area. The bots were confused by the lifts, so they were replaced by teleporters.</li>\n\
      <li> The asteroid was shaped in 3D Studio Max and imported into the Unreal Editor.</li>\n\
      <li> The skybox was reused from the Ending sequence of <a href=\"/Unreal\" title=\"\
      Unreal\">Unreal</a> and improved with moons and galaxies.</li>\n<li> Some remakes\
      \ for tournament and league play removed the sniper rifle and replaced it with\
      \ other weapons, but effectively ruined the need for sniper towers.</li>\n<li>\
      \ GameSpy named the map as the fifth best Capture The Flag level of the FPS\
      \ history, and G4TV named it one of the most influential levels of FPS history.</li></ul>\n\

      margin-bottom: 0px;\">I had this idea after playing a great Unreal level.<br\
      \ />I don't remember the Level name but it was a really popular DM level with\
      \ 2 bases and a big bridge, and a tower on the side with a <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\"\
      \ title=\"Sniper Rifle\">Sniper Rifle</a>. I wanted this Sniping Tower concept\
      \ with a different gameplay (<a href=\"/Capture_The_Flag\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Capture The Flag\">Capture The Flag</a>), the atmosphere also had\
      \ to be completely different. So I did this weird asteroid shape in 3DSMAX and\
      \ imported it in the Unreal Editor, making the towers was easy, but making the\
      \ bots working right was by far the hardest and longest part of the work. The\
      \ original design had lifts but the bots were really confused so I used teleporters.<br\
      \ /><br />The Skybox is interesting I think, I saw <a href=\"/Juan_Pancho_%27XceptOne%27_Eekels\"\
      \ title=\"Juan Pancho 'XceptOne' Eekels\">Pancho</a> working on <a href=\"/DM-KGalleon\"\
      \ title=\"DM-KGalleon\">Koos Galleon</a> and he was trying all kinds of tricks\
      \ to make the skybox follow the motion of the waves. I realized a really cool\
      \ effect could be done by just rotating the Skybox with a regular motion so\
      \ I used the Skybox I made for the <a href=\"/edit/Ending_Sequence?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Ending Sequence (page does not exist)\">Ending Sequence</a>\
      \ of <a href=\"/Unreal\" title=\"Unreal\">Unreal</a>, since this one was really\
      \ under-used (you could see it for 1 second and a half in the original game)\
      \ so I imported it in <a href=\"/Unreal_Tournament\" title=\"Unreal Tournament\"\
      >Unreal Tournament</a> and I improved it with new galaxies and Moon textures\
      \ from Mike and <a href=\"/Shane_Caudle\" title=\"Shane Caudle\">Shane</a>.\
      \ The original Level was turning 4 times faster, but <a href=\"/Cliff_Bleszinski\"\
      \ title=\"Cliff Bleszinski\">Cliff</a> complained he wanted to puke so I had\
      \ to change it to prevent players to be too distracted during the game. The\
      \ effect could really make your head spinning and give you vertigo, making you\
      \ wondering 'is the screen really moving or what&#160;???'.<br />Making the\
      \ Earth texture was a bit tricky as well, especially working around the 256*256\
      \ texture limitation. I wish I could just use the original texture I had, which\
      \ was in 1024*1024, but if I did that it would appear very blurred for the 3DFX\
      \ users and I wanted to give them the best visual experience possible. So I\
      \ had to split the texture in 4 small 256*256 textures, which give a final result\
      \ of 512*512. This is annoying to do because the bilinear filtering is blending\
      \ the edges together. In the end the line between the different polygons is\
      \ almost completely hidden but it's a painful process, I'm glad I didn't have\
      \ to do this too much.<br />If you have a Savage2000, you'll have a very good\
      \ Earth texture thanks to S3TC.<br /><br />At this time I was really into Ambient/Techno\
      \ like Future Sound of London excellent album: LifeForms. I chose the music\
      \ to give the same feeling to the Level.<br />In the end, this Level is the\
      \ most original work I did so far, with its unique gameplay and atmosphere.\
      \ This Level was also very well received by the public since I had countless\
      \ E-mails of people telling me how much they like it. I'm really proud of achieving\
      \ such a result with this level.<sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a\

      \ ==\n'''CTF-Face''', also known as Facing Worlds or simply \"Face\", is a capture\
      \ the flag (CTF) map from Unreal Tournament.\n\nIt consists of an asteroid and\
      \ two towers, each belonging to each team. The central part of the Asteroid\
      \ holds a Big Keg O' Health.\n\nThe bases themselves have the flag inside of\
      \ them, and three teleporters guiding to three different spots. The lower level\
      \ holds the Flag, a Shock Rifle and a Rocket Launcher. There's also a platform\
      \ holding a Damage Ampifier.\n\nWith the entrance to each base being at the\
      \ south, the west teleporter ends in a small chamber holding a Redeemer. The\
      \ east teleport ends in another chamber, above the Redeemer chamber, this time\
      \ holding a Sniper Rifle. And the third teleporter is placed right in the center\
      \ of the lower area, and ends in the top of the tower, where players can find\
      \ another Sniper Rifle and an Armor vest. Outside of the bases, players can\
      \ find some weapons and ammo as well.\n\nIt is the most well-known map in the\
      \ game, liked by many for its simple, symmetric design, and similarly reviled\
      \ by some for its exploitative design that appeals to snipers and campers.\n\

      == Tips & tricks ==\n* This is a good map to show how the Translocator can nullify\
      \ excessive sniping, as well as opening new \"routes\" regarding reaching the\
      \ enemy flag. For example, good use of the Translocator can allow you to enter\
      \ through the Redeemer hole or the Amplifier platform (with a chance to deny\
      \ the Amplifier to your enemy), effectively avoiding frontal combat.\n* Use\
      \ the Redeemer to get rid of pesky snipers if you're on offense.\n* While escaping\
      \ with the flag, go to the top of the tower, pick the Armor (effectively denying\
      \ it to yor opponent) and start downclimbing the tower, slowly, as to take the\
      \ less damage as possible, while your teammates are busy dealing with the enemy\
      \ team.\n==Trivia== \n* CTF-Face was inspired by a community map for Unreal,\
      \ which consisted of 2 bases (with small towers) linked by a bridge. Inoxx,\
      \ however, chose to make the towers taller to make sniping a major element in\
      \ the map<ref>[http://www.beyondunreal.com/view_story.php?id=590 BeyondUnreal]</ref>.\n\
      * The original design for the map had lifts, no middle sniping area nor Redeemer\
      \ area. The bots were confused by the lifts, so they were replaced by teleporters.\n\
      * The asteroid was shaped in 3D Studio Max and imported into the Unreal Editor.\n\
      * The skybox was reused from the Ending sequence of [[Unreal]] and improved\
      \ with moons and galaxies.\n* Some remakes for tournament and league play removed\
      \ the sniper rifle and replaced it with other weapons, but effectively ruined\
      \ the need for sniper towers.\n* GameSpy named the map as the fifth best Capture\
      \ The Flag level of the FPS history, and G4TV named it one of the most influential\
      \ levels of FPS history.\n{{QuoteSource|If you like to snipe, Facing Worlds\
      \ must be a lot like dying and going to heaven. Two tall towers float lonely\
      \ in space, separated by a very long, open crossroads. Trying to cross between\

      {{QuoteSource|I had this idea after playing a great Unreal level.<br>I don't\
      \ remember the Level name but it was a really popular DM level with 2 bases\
      \ and a big bridge, and a tower on the side with a [[Sniper Rifle]]. I wanted\
      \ this Sniping Tower concept with a different gameplay ([[Capture The Flag]]),\
      \ the atmosphere also had to be completely different. So I did this weird asteroid\
      \ shape in 3DSMAX and imported it in the Unreal Editor, making the towers was\
      \ easy, but making the bots working right was by far the hardest and longest\
      \ part of the work. The original design had lifts but the bots were really confused\
      \ so I used teleporters.<br><br>The Skybox is interesting I think, I saw [[Juan\
      \ Pancho 'XceptOne' Eekels|Pancho]] working on [[DM-KGalleon|Koos Galleon]]\
      \ and he was trying all kinds of tricks to make the skybox follow the motion\
      \ of the waves. I realized a really cool effect could be done by just rotating\
      \ the Skybox with a regular motion so I used the Skybox I made for the [[Ending\
      \ Sequence]] of [[Unreal]], since this one was really under-used (you could\
      \ see it for 1 second and a half in the original game) so I imported it in [[Unreal\
      \ Tournament]] and I improved it with new galaxies and Moon textures from Mike\
      \ and [[Shane Caudle|Shane]]. The original Level was turning 4 times faster,\
      \ but [[Cliff Bleszinski|Cliff]] complained he wanted to puke so I had to change\
      \ it to prevent players to be too distracted during the game. The effect could\
      \ really make your head spinning and give you vertigo, making you wondering\
      \ 'is the screen really moving or what ???'.<br>Making the Earth texture was\
      \ a bit tricky as well, especially working around the 256*256 texture limitation.\
      \ I wish I could just use the original texture I had, which was in 1024*1024,\
      \ but if I did that it would appear very blurred for the 3DFX users and I wanted\
      \ to give them the best visual experience possible. So I had to split the texture\
      \ in 4 small 256*256 textures, which give a final result of 512*512. This is\
      \ annoying to do because the bilinear filtering is blending the edges together.\
      \ In the end the line between the different polygons is almost completely hidden\
      \ but it's a painful process, I'm glad I didn't have to do this too much.<br>If\
      \ you have a Savage2000, you'll have a very good Earth texture thanks to S3TC.<br><br>At\
      \ this time I was really into Ambient/Techno like Future Sound of London excellent\
      \ album: LifeForms. I chose the music to give the same feeling to the Level.<br>In\
      \ the end, this Level is the most original work I did so far, with its unique\
      \ gameplay and atmosphere. This Level was also very well received by the public\
      \ since I had countless E-mails of people telling me how much they like it.\
      \ I'm really proud of achieving such a result with this level.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070429033538/http://www.planetunreal.com/inoxx/maps/face.htm\
