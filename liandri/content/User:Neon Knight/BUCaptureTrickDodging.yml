      \ wall then dodge away from the direction of the wall), and something you may\
      \ have seen, called Boost Dodging. It's a mix between a Double Jump and a Dodge,\
      \ and the engine percieves it as both, so you can get some serious distance\
      \ and height. The boost dodge can just about reach the same heights as a hammer\
      \ jump, but does not damage you in any way. The only difficulty with a boost\
      \ dodge is that it requires the right setup.\n</p><p>The target location you\
      \ want to boost to has to be the adjacent to a wall that you can hit at a 45\
      \ degree angle. As you hold you run key forward into the wall at that 45 degree\
      \ angle, hit a strafe direction away from wall with the jump key at the same\
      \ time, twice. It'll take some practice, but you should here a unique mix of\
      \ the player “grunt” noise, and it will propel you to your target location,\
      \ as long as it is not too high. The boost dodge can be used effectively to\
      \ get to areas that you normally wouldn't be able to without a translocator\
      \ (i.e., while you're a flag runner). For example, try running to the middle\
      \ of CTF-Orbital2, and run at that magic 45 degree angle towards the sides of\
      \ the middle ramps with the shield power up. If you start a boost dodge right\
      \ as you hit the area that the light touches the walls, you'll be able to boost\
      \ dodge up to the higher walkways that lead to the upper levels of each base.\
      \ This can be very useful for giving your pursuers a bit more of a challenge!\
      \ Try out your boost dodging skills in your favorite levels, and I can almost\
      \ guarantee it will provide you with some route you'd have never thought of\
      \ before. \n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right;font-style:italic;\">Written\
