      \ a system of pipes that hang over both capture points, but not in-between;\
      \ a top catwalk that runs from one end of the map to the other which is interrupted\
      \ in the middle by a lightning gun and some health. The two Capture points are\
      \ located inside identical bases that are at opposite sides of the map. The\
      \ capture points can be reached by falling from the pipes or by a passageway\
      \ on the ground level.\n</p><p>The passageway into the capture points are the\
      \ choke points of the map. They are where the most heated action takes place.\
      \ Control of these points is critical to a team's success on this map. A short\
      \ distance from these passageways is a ninety degree turn. This turn prevents\
      \ the defenders from seeing their enemy before they are right on top of each\
      \ other; however, there is a camping spot for the defenders. The camping spot\
      \ can be reached by jumping on to the top of the passageway and then shield\
      \ jumping onto the pipe that is right above it. It's the large pipe that has\
      \ a small one right above it. This spot is perfect to suprise the attackers\
      \ that think no one is there to stop them!\n</p><p>A tandem of skilled defenders\
      \ is all that is necessary to successfully defend a capture point: one is watching\
      \ out for any attackers that are falling from the pipes and the other guarding\
      \ the door. The door defender should be equipped with the Shock Rifle, MiniGun,\
      \ and Lightning Gun. The top defender really only needs the Lightning Gun and\
      \ the Shock Rifle. If one of the defenders is killed, the other should go behind\
      \ the Capture point, where he can defend both angles, to defend until the other\
      \ returns. While going solo, the Shock Combo is the best weapon to fend off\
      \ the attackers because it covers the most amount of space per shot. While in\
      \ a countdown, it is best to charge up your shield gun and stand on top of the\
      \ capture point to gib any one from falling on the point at the last second.\n\
      </p><p>One of the easiest ways to get from one side of the map to the other\
      \ is by using the catwalk at the very top of the map. It can be reached by double\
      \ jumping off of the big elevators that are on the side of both bases. The catwalk\
      \ runs from one base to the other. In the middle of the map, there is a room\
      \ that houses a lightning gun and some health. The catwalk is started and ended\
      \ by an alcove that houses a regular shield. The catwalk will let you move quickly\
      \ to make a last second save. It is possible to jump from the catwalk onto a\
      \ capture point. To do this, you must forward jump from the portion of catwalk\
      \ that is directly above the elevator that takes you from the Capture Point\
      \ base onto the catwalk.\n</p><p>There are also some really neat trick jumps\
      \ for this map, none of which I have been able to pull off. The first one I\
      \ know off if the wall boost dodge off of the ledge that the control points\
      \ are on onto the elevator. Rumor has it that it is the hardest boost dodge\
      \ to pull off in the entire game. The other trick is to boost off of a small\
      \ elevator in the middle of the map onto the catwalk. I know of one person who\
      \ has pulled it off and it is amazing. It is supposedly done by using a shield\
      \ jump.\n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right;font-style:italic;\">Incase you\
