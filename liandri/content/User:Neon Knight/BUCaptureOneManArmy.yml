      \ strong? Do you think you’re dangerous? Do you really believe that you are\
      \ the last hope for your team? Well, the answer would be NO! You may think you\
      \ are the best one on your team…and that could be true, but you can’t take the\
      \ entire enemy team by yourself. You need your help and support no matter how\
      \ useless they may seem.\n</p><p><b>Going It Alone (Offense)</b><br />\nFrom\
      \ what I’ve seen and experienced, this just doesn’t work. When you have minigun\
      \ turrets, sniper rifle shots, rocket fire, and flak shards all flying at you…\
      you usually don’t make it very far. If the guys aren’t doing much to help, all\
      \ you can do is use them as a human shield and you may be able to slip by. If\
      \ they get shot and you don’t, you become a happy fragger. Going ahead in the\
      \ map unnoticed never helps either. You may think, “ooh if I wait here then\
      \ we can get two objectives done really fast!” The problem with this is that\
      \ your team is one more player down trying to get the current objective. Often\
      \ times some lost guy on the defending team finds and shoots you anyway so that\
      \ is pretty much pointless. The rest of your team needs you to help them get\
      \ the objectives. Work with them as best as you can even if it almost makes\
      \ you cry.\n</p><p><b>Going It Alone (Defense)</b><br />\nThat’s right, alone\
      \ on defense. You might think that this would never happen because the only\
      \ job you have is to kill, kill and kill some more. But say all or just some\
      \ of your teammates are lost or waiting to defend the very last objective when\
      \ the offensive team is only on the second. It might be easier to defend by\
      \ yourself than it is to attack, but it is still very difficult. I would suggest\
      \ finding yourself a nice sniping position and pop some heads. At least it will\
      \ slow the attacking team down while the rest of your team finds their way back\
      \ and finally realizes they aren’t helping any.\n</p><p><b>Laying Down The Law</b><br\
      \ />\nSometimes you can get so frustrated during a game when your team isn’\
      t cooperating that you start complaining and whining like a baby for them to\
      \ do something useful. If you come across as being annoying and yelling at them,\
      \ they won’t listen. They will just continue doing whatever they want to do\
      \ and they won’t want to help you. So if you are going to “Lay Down The Law”\
      , do it in a nice way so maybe some of your teammates will attempt to help.\
      \ You need their help, because remember, you can’t do it all alone. You aren't\
      \ really the \"Big Shot\" you think you are.\n</p><p><b>The Conclusion</b><br\
      \ />\nIt is obviously impossible to win in assault by yourself. Unless you are\
      \ god (not likely) you should work as best as you can with your team and make\
      \ the best of it. If you are nice to everyone, maybe you will make some friends\
      \ that will enjoy helping you out. That’s what a Buddy List is for. You play\
      \ with your FRIENDS.\n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right;font-style:italic;\"\
