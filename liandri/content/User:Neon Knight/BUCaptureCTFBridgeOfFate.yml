      \ slightly sneakier entrance<br />\n2) Defending\n</p><p><b>The Actual Article</b><br\
      \ />\n1) Offensive Tactics\n</p><p>Well, we should all be aware by now of the\
      \ sheer size of the level, and it must be said that that presents quite an advantage\
      \ to you, my dear attackers. Because the bases are so mind bogglingly huge,\
      \ it is all but impossible for an average sized team of defenders to cover the\
      \ whole thing all at once, meaning that while you may encounter enemy attackers\
      \ coming the other way, you should not expect any serious opposition until you\
      \ reach the Flag room itself.<br />\nThat, however, isn’t a indication that\
      \ you should travel fast and light, because not only are all the defenders going\
      \ to be in the flag room, they’re all going to be heavily armed and waiting\
      \ for you to pop up – and then there’s the small matter of getting the flag\
      \ back to your base. A successful attack on an enemy base requires –as always-\
      \ large amounts of armour, ordnance, and, if possible, teamwork.\n</p><p>1.1)\
      \ Preliminary\n</p><p>We will assume, for the purposes of this exercise that\
      \ you’re spawning in the flag room. If, by some cruel twist of chance you don’\
      t spawn in this desirable locale then you’re just going to have to make do,\
      \ ‘cause I’m not going to repeat this for every single bloody spawn point. Ready?\n\
      </p><p>Once you’ve spawned, your first ports of call should be the <b>Flak Cannon</b>\
      \ and <b>Rocket Launcher</b>, stored either side of the flag room, down those\
      \ two dinky little tunnels. These will serve the dual purpose of momentarily\
      \ keeping you near the flag room in case you’re needed there, as well as letting\
      \ you load up on some serious hardware. Of course, once you’ve got them both,\
      \ it’s probably time to go on the offensive.\n</p><p>1.2) Frontal Assault\n\
      </p><p>The frontal assault is probably truly effective as a diversionary tactic\
      \ (giving someone a chance to slip in from the sides and half-inch the flag)\
      \ or if you happen to be Arnold Schwarzenegger. Either way, once you’ve loaded\
      \ up with the above hardcore weaponry, make your way out of the front door of\
      \ the flag room and into the main room.<br />\nYou should be at full health\
      \ at this stage, so you can forego the handy spinning health pickups. Both the\
      \ <b>Link Gun</b> and the <b>Minigun</b> may be worth picking up if you’re a\
      \ mid-range fighter. Certainly, you should make a point of grabbing the Shield\
      \ if it happens to be present. Don’t stick around waiting for it if it isn’\
      t there, though – you might well find one in the enemy base.\n</p><p>The next\
      \ section is, surprisingly, normally pretty safe. Despite the fact you have\
      \ to walk across a pretty thin bridge completely exposed to potential snipers,\
      \ everyone is normally buggering across the other bridges for your flag, hiding\
      \ out in the flag room, or complaining about the lag. Regardless, that shouldn’\
      t stop you from hotfooting it across this area, making a quick point to grab\
      \ the Damage Amplifier should it be present – you’re going to need it.\n</p><p>Of\
      \ course, the enemy’s hall is much the same as yours, aside from the fact that\
      \ it is probably populated by a fair few enemy goits, who will no doubt experience\
      \ feelings of deep displeasure at you being in their base. They may even try\
      \ and vent this anger upon you by way of blasting your constituent atoms into\
      \ the nth dimension, but that’s just because they didn’t receive enough hugs\
      \ as children. Forgive them their childish anger, before reciprocating with\
      \ that double-damaged <b>Rocket Launcher</b> you thoughtfully collected at the\
      \ start of your assault. Once their entrails have finished raining down from\
      \ the ceiling, you can proceed to the enemy Flag Room.\n</p><p>As covered later,\
      \ you might well find that there’s a defender sitting on the arch above the\
      \ door with some sort of pain-inducing device in hand. Just be aware and make\
      \ sure they don’t jump you. Even if there isn’t a defender there, you’ll most\
      \ likely have quite a fight on your hands to get up to the flag, especially\
      \ considering that many people will no doubt be on voice comms hollering for\
      \ assistance.\nGrab the flag, and hightail it out of there.\n</p><p>1.3) The\
      \ slightly sneakier entrance\n</p><p>In the likely event that you’re not the\
      \ Arbiter from Austria, you might want to consider the advantages of going in\
      \ around the back. While the route may be a little longer, it does have the\
      \ advantage that you basically bypass the main hall, which is where you’re likely\
      \ to encounter swathes of enemies going about their duties. Of course, you might\
      \ well find the odd enemy coming in the opposite direction, but that’s just\
      \ a risk you’re going to have to take.\n</p><p>Starting from the Flag Room,\
      \ you may as well load up once more with the <b>Flak Cannon</b> and <b>Rocket\
      \ Launcher</b>, because, let’s face it, you’d be under compensating otherwise.\
      \ Now, from here you have a choice of which route you want to take – you can\
      \ either go left, or you can go right…but guess what? They’re basically sodding\
      \ identical. Once you’ve picked up the heavy weaponry, follow on past to the\
      \ side galleries, where you can add a <b>Shock Rifle</b> to that unfeasibly\
      \ large arsenal of yours. The correct direction should now be obvious to even\
      \ the slowest amongst you, as you need to go but forwards and up some stairs\
      \ to reach the small platform overlooking the Bridge of Fate.\n</p><p>Now, I\
      \ did say just a few moments ago that the paths are basically identical, but\
      \ there is one critical difference. If you follow the side corridor leading\
      \ off from the <b>Flak Cannon</b>, then you’ll always end up wrapping your greasy\
      \ mitts around a <b>Bio Rifle</b>, whilst the <b>Super Shield</b> can be found\
      \ simply by proceeding past the <b>Rocket Launcher</b>. However, the other pickup\
      \ can found at the far end of the bridge, so unless you meet someone on the\
      \ bridge itself it doesn’t really matter a damn which way you go.\n</p><p>Of\
      \ course, the enemy base is exactly the same as yours – just reversed one hundred\
      \ and eighty degrees. It should be a simple matter to peg it down the stairs\
      \ and through the side galleries, making a point to grab any weaponry or ammo\
      \ that you need en route. It’s the enemy’s ammo, after all – so help yourself.\
      \ Once you’ve reached the small waterway between the heavy weaponry and the\
      \ Flag room, you’re basically there. Of course, there might be the odd defender,\
      \ but by now you should be proficient at drop-kicking people off the mortal\
      \ coil. Grab that flag, and run like Captain Buggery himself were after you.\n\
      </p><p>2) Defending\n</p><p>Naturally, getting the flag is only half the job.\
      \ The other half of the job is making certain that those cunning foxes on the\
      \ enemy team don’t purloin your flag while you’re all out enjoying the luxuries\
      \ of their base. To this end, you need guys to intercept these pennon pinchers.<br\
      \ />\nUnfortunately, Bridge of Fate is -as you may have guessed by my earlier\
      \ statements- quite sizeable, meaning that the number of defenders you’d need\
      \ to cover it entirely would leave no-one left for attacking the enemy base.\
      \ Therefore, you need a more fluid, communicative team, with the attackers also\
      \ performing an outer defence role. If they meet anyone, they should engage\
      \ them, and if they die then the least they can do is radio back (or type, if\
      \ they haven’t got with the program yet) where the guy was coming in from.<br\
      \ />\nAs for flag room defence, there are several places where you can quite\
      \ happily get the drop on the enemy. If they’re coming in from the side passages,\
      \ then their movement is going to be very heavily restricted within the confines\
      \ of the tunnel – which means the best remedy is a bit of the ol’ Rocket Surprise\
      \ or a heapin’ helping of flak. Defending against an incursion from these entrances\
      \ is best done from the upper level, meaning that anything you launch at them\
      \ will impact on the floor nearby their frail bodies. With those two entrances\
      \ covered, the only other place entry can be gained is through the main hall\
      \ and front door of the Flag Room. However, if you have someone sitting on the\
      \ arch directly above the door, then they should be able to get at least one\
      \ surprise attack on the incoming kleptomaniac. Even if it doesn’t kill them,\
      \ it’ll make people far more wary about going in that way then the other two.\n\
      </p><p>While the majority of the map is quite spread out –making hitscan weapons\
      \ a good choice- the flag room itself is actually quite confined. This means\
      \ that any weapon with a large explosive radius is good for attackers and defenders\
      \ alike. If you have the time or the numbers, get someone to pick up a <b>Bio\
      \ Rifle</b> from the outlying caves – the goop that it can lay down in a causeway\
      \ could delay attackers for long enough to ship in reinforcements. \n</p>\n\
