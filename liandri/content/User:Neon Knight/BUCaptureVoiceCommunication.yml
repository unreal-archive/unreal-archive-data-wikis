      \ Communication</u></b>\n</p><p>One of the most interesting new features to\
      \ be added in ut2k4 is the built-in voice com system. Previously, only clans\
      \ and other organised groups of players tended to use 3rd party communication\
      \ programs with the normal player relying mainly on binds. Now everyone can\
      \ instantly get on their mics and begin barking orders or talking smack to everyone\
      \ in the game. The main benefit of this being that you can tell anyone who can\
      \ understand the language you are using exactly what, when and how you are going\
      \ to go about winning the map without having to bind keys to a limited set of\
      \ descriptions. If used constructively, to talk about what you are doing instead\
      \ of complaining about how your team is rubbish and that's why you lost or how\
      \ good their mother is in bed, teamwork can be made much easier.\n</p><p><b><u>Basics</u></b>\n\
      </p><p>Firstly, head into the audio options and make sure you've got the voice\
      \ settings configured how you need them. Take into account your bandwidth when\
      \ deciding on the quality settings and be sure to tweak the volumes until you\
      \ can hear other people and they can hear you, you'll have to use the windows\
      \ volume controls for your mic volume settings.\n</p><p>The default key setting\
      \ is as follows:\n</p><p>F - Hold this down to talk on your mic<br />\nI - Toggles\
      \ from your current channel to teamchat and back again<br />\nO - Toggles from\
      \ your current channel to local and back again<br />\nP - Toggles from your\
      \ current channel to public and back again\n</p><p>You can also change channels\
      \ using the menu the V key brings up, option 1 is voice com.\n</p><p>The channel\
      \ toggle keys (I,O and P) must be held down while you also hold F to speak into\
      \ your mic in order for your speech to go through to the channel you want. Personally,\
      \ I find this to be a little tricky when I'm in the middle of a game so I changed\
      \ them to be single press channel switches. You can do this by going into the\
      \ User.ini file in the system folder and removing the \"|OnRelease SpeakLast\"\
      \ part from the chat toggle aliases, they are numbers 29,30 and 31 in the list\
      \ at the start of the ini. Just remember which channel you are speaking on,\
      \ you don't want to be telling everyone on the other team what your team is\
      \ up to by speaking in public.\n</p><p>Remember, if you have altered any of\
      \ the voice binds without thinking about it and need to get them back you can\
      \ always find the line to re-enter in the DefUser.ini.\n</p><p>If you've got\
      \ a mic then use it! I'm sure your voice can't be that freakish that you don't\
      \ want people to hear it. If everyone in the team hooks up on the coms then\
      \ you can all go rolling up to your enemy's nodes/flag/objectives in a group\
      \ and deliver them a beating.\n</p><p><b><u>CTF</u></b>\n</p><p>Now I will just\
      \ give some brief advice on what kinds of comments are helpful to your team\
      \ mates from various positions in capture the flag.\n</p><p><u>Defence</u>\n\
      </p><p>When defending, it is important to keep your flag carrier and support\
      \ players updated on the safety of your base. If there are enemies in your flag\
      \ room when the carrier is coming back to cap then they need to be told to proceed\
      \ with caution. It is also good to call for backup from the midfield players\
      \ when you feel that you are about to be overrun by the enemy.\n</p><p><u>Midfield</u>\n\
      </p><p>Voice chat is a great way to let your defenders know which way enemies\
      \ are approaching the flag room from. No more binds, but a brief snippet of\
      \ chat to tell them exactly where you saw them enter. This is invaluable information\
      \ as it allows the defence to position itself according to where the threat\
      \ will come from. Quick thinking on their part can give them the drop on attackers\
      \ who might otherwise have a much greater chance of winning a firefight with\
      \ them. Remember, forewarned is forearmed.\n</p><p><u>Attack</u>\n</p><p>If\
      \ you can give an accurate comment about your current location and path then\
      \ it is much more likely that your team will be there to meet you and provide\
      \ backup as you head home with the flag. Setting up attacks is much easier over\
      \ voice chat as well, tell your team mates where you are meeting up and which\
      \ way you are going in and off you go.\n</p><p><b><u>ONS and Assault</u></b>\n\
      </p><p>Both of these gametypes require a similar style of communication, namely\
      \ the identification of which target you are aiming at and how you are going\
      \ to go about hitting it. Use the voice chat to co-ordinate your attempts at\
      \ various objectives so that your team doesn't approach in dribs and drabs to\
      \ be easily picked off by the enemy. If you talk on team and get people who\
      \ are respawning to hold back and team up you will have a much better chance\
      \ of success.\n</p><p>In Onslaught, saying which vehicle you are taking, where\
      \ you are taking it from and where you are going with it is a good way to let\
      \ your team know what kind of support to expect at critical points. Telling\
      \ them your starting location allows them to know that you are able to travel\
      \ with them if the are nearby, gaining you gunners for the hellbender or tank\
      \ or getting your team out to hotspots quicker on the manta's wings.\n</p><p>The\
      \ most powerful use for the voice chat in assault is to change the tactics you\
      \ are using to capture a particular objective in mid-game. If your enemies are\
      \ defending in a particular way that leaves other objectives vunerable then\
      \ describing the weakness and how you wish to exploit it allows your team a\
      \ quick shift in focus. Catching the opposition napping feels pretty good when\
      \ you hit objectives in quick succession with no resistance.\n</p><p>The addition\
      \ of voice communication to the unreal engine is a very welcome one that gives\
      \ a much greater scope for teamwork in public games than ever before. Hopefully\
      \ it will be accepted as the norm by the communitry to talk to each other during\
      \ games to help each other out and not just to endlessly smack talk on insta\
      \ dm servers. \n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right;font-style:italic;\">Written\
