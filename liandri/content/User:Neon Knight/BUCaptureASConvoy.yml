      \ after a brief hiatus. Convoy is the first Assault gamers will recognize in\
      \ UT2004, having been in the demo. Having played a lot of Convoy, I've picked\
      \ up on several key tactics which you can employ both online and offline. Bots\
      \ are smart opponents and will function a lot like humans, so don't think you\
      \ won't get a good lesson offline. In Convoy there's many skills you can benefit\
      \ from using frequently, especially dodge-jumping and double-jumping. First\
      \ thing I'll discuss is the layout of the map.\n</p><p><b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:16pt;text-decoration:underline;\"\
      >Layout</span></b>\n</p><p>The ultimate goal of the attacking team in Convoy\
      \ is to capture the Nexus missiles on the other side of the repair vessel, which\
      \ is where the defending team will spend most of the first four objectives.\
      \ There are three vehicles of importance in Convoy: the repair vessel, the missile\
      \ trailer, and the attacking team's vehicle (has no name). In order to cross\
      \ the span between the attacking vehicle and the repair vessel, the attacking\
      \ team must rotate a bridge by holding a point near the head of the vehicle.\
      \ There are two viable methods for achieving this; go through the cargo of pipes\
      \ and boxes or take the high road by dodge-jumping from the spawn point to the\
      \ mesh netting above said cargo, then jumping onto the large pipe and onto the\
      \ bridge itself. Defenders will make their stand starting here, as a jump pad\
      \ will launch them across the void and right into the heart of the battle. Goings\
      \ will be made easier for the attacking team as a weapon cache just beyond the\
      \ bridge offer better weapons and change the spawn point for a quicker advance.\n\
      </p><p>The role of minigun turrets in Convoy is huge, especially for the defense.\
      \ The minigun turrets take a little more leading (of the target) to operate,\
      \ but they're more powerful than the handheld weapon and can be devastating\
      \ in the hands of the right person. The attacking team has one such minigun\
      \ turret in their position right from the get go, just ahead and to the right\
      \ of the inital spawn point. Another minigun turret can be made available if\
      \ the forward weapon cache is taken. (This minigun is immediately available\
      \ to the defenders.) The turrets can be destroyed but it requires many rockets\
      \ to do. On the missile trailer side, the defenders have two minigun turrets:\
      \ one at the head of the missile trailer and one above the position from where\
      \ the attackers will be coming.\n</p><p>Once the bridge is turned and the attackers\
      \ can begin boarding the repair vessel, a long, thin, and exposed walkway brings\
      \ them to the door of the repair vessel, which must be blown up (explosives\
      \ automatically given to you) in order to enter. This is where the quickest\
      \ advance or the longest stand can be held, because of the bottleneck the walkway\
      \ offers. Once the door is blown, the attackers then only have to go a few steps\
      \ to the switch that opens the rear door, moves the spawn point and gives more\
      \ weapons. However, a bottleneck at the door will make progress extremely difficult.\
      \ As the rear door opens, the attackers are faced with a long advance up the\
      \ repair vessel. A gasoline tanker in the middle can be destroyed, which opens\
      \ up the middle and gives the attackers another option. The next switch which\
      \ opens the way to the missile trailer is on the suspended wire-mesh platform\
      \ flanked by health and ammo. Two ramps on the sides lead up to the platform,\
      \ and the switch is at the front of the platform. Two crates also allow for\
      \ quicker access, by jumping up them and onto the platform. The switch opens\
      \ up two doors, one at the front and back of the repair vessel, from where the\
      \ attackers will make their run for the missile trailer.\n</p><p>The missile\
      \ trailer section has 3 vehicles other than the missile trailer and repair vessel\
      \ which play a part in the attack. Two cargo vehicles supply cover from the\
      \ minigun turrets and connect the way to the missile trailer, as well as health\
      \ and weaponry. Getting past the turret on the missile trailer will bring you\
      \ to health and a small opening in the back of the trailer which drops you into\
      \ the missile chamber itself. Two doors on the sides of the missile trailer\
      \ open up, allowing for the missiles to move through (they go out the right\
      \ side of the trailer) and for people to go in. The third vehicle is a small,\
      \ unprotected tank. Attackers coming out the rear of the repair vessel can jump\
      \ onto the vehicle and ride it either to the head of the missile trailer or\
      \ onto the left door of the trailer. If the turrets are destroyed, the missile\
      \ trailer will be the Alamo of the defense and will be swarming (most likely)\
      \ with many defenders. These openings offer a shorter trip to the missiles and\
      \ a more surprising attack.\n</p><p><b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:16pt;text-decoration:underline;\"\
      >Attacking Strategies</span></b>\n</p><p>Speed is the biggest key to attacking\
      \ in Assault, but not just speed to the objectives but speed to making sure\
      \ the defense has a tough time stopping you. In Convoy, the best way to give\
      \ the defense a hard time is by destroying their minigun turrets. Right out\
      \ of the gate, at least one person should make their job expending the rocket\
      \ launcher ammo on the minigun turret on the repair vessel. That way, the defense\
      \ has to earn their frags, not rack them up. The minigun turrets made available\
      \ to the offense are in somewhat ineffective firing positions, though logic\
      \ would lead one to believe that if the defender's minigun turret covers the\
      \ left side of the cargo vehicle and bridge, then the attackers would stay on\
      \ the right side, which would bring the defenders to the right side. Unfortunately,\
      \ I've yet to play a match with people who think logically 100%. For what it's\
      \ worth, however, the minigun turrets can attack each other, and if anyone is\
      \ sniping and is in vision they won't be sniping for long. Ultimately the attacking\
      \ minigun is made pretty useless by its inability to get into the battle, so\
      \ to speak, and shouldn't be manned consistently.\n</p><p>(Ed: willhaven brought\
      \ up the point about the shield gun on the thread about this article on the\
      \ Atari forums. I completely forgot about it even though I use the shield while\
      \ I'm taking a switch too. As an attacker, the shield will gain you more time\
      \ before being killed regardless of who's attacking you. Make sure to crouch\
      \ so you don't get killed by someone targetting your toes, which wouldn't be\
      \ protected if you just stood up.)\n</p><p>Getting the bridge rotated is sort\
      \ of the opposite of the \"high road, low road\" Scottish song, in that the\
      \ high road (going on top of the mesh and the pipes) will get you to the bridge\
      \ quicker and will catch the defense unawares, but the high road leaves you\
      \ much more open to the minigun turret, which can slice you down in a hurry.\
      \ If the turret is gone, advancing shouldn't be difficult. Getting the forward\
      \ weapon cache should be one person's job as well. The height of the cache's\
      \ body should provide a good blind spot for you to sneak around the minigun\
      \ turret, if someone is there. Once the cache is taken, taking the bridge objective\
      \ shouldn't be tough. The walkway is tougher but flak and rocket discipline\
      \ should pave the way for progress. Equally tough is opening the rear door.\
      \ I've found that defenders will pay attention to anyone in the opposite color\
      \ scheme, so what I try to do is get into the vessel and draw as many guys away\
      \ by running as far back as possible. If I make it to the next objective switch\
      \ (which you can't take until the previous objective is taken), I'll fire down\
      \ the hall (with anything; mini, flak, pulse) which will kill defenders or,\
      \ again, get their attention away from the door. Try it and see if it works\
      \ for you. Once the rear door objective is taken, jump up the crates near the\
      \ platform for a quicker and less attention-grabbing way to the switch.\n</p><p>The\
      \ missile trailer is the toughest vehicle to breach because now you've got two\
      \ minigun turrets in tough positions with no rockets (but typically flak) to\
      \ take them out easily. The way to the trailer doesn't offer a lot of cover\
      \ from either, so you'll have to be quick and go in guns blazing. The minigun\
      \ turret above where you'll begin your assault on the trailer is the easier\
      \ of the two to destroy because you can't be directly stopped by the turret\
      \ itself. Lobbing flak bombs up there won't be an exact science most of the\
      \ time but when you hit it'll hurt. Other than that, your best bet is to go\
      \ in groups: one takes the left of the trailer, one takes the right. Eventually\
      \ this strategy should get you inside the missile trailer, which will then make\
      \ things easier and tougher at the same time. You'll have three openings: the\
      \ hole you just jumped through and two doors which open on the sides of the\
      \ trailers. Most of the defense will make their stand inside the trailer, so\
      \ you'll be faced with a more specific defensive unit. Near the opening of the\
      \ hole, there's health, a weapon locker, and a jumper which will put you back\
      \ to the hole. My strategy for this part is to go into the missile trailer on\
      \ one of the two doors, fire away while falling back, use the jumper and repeat.\
      \ This will weaken or kill the defenders leaving your teammates to clean up\
      \ and take the objective.\n</p><p><b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:16pt;text-decoration:underline;\"\
      >Defensive Strategies</span></b>\n</p><p>As soon as possible someone should\
      \ be on the minigun turret and, if possible, a sniper to cover the minigunner.\
      \ As I said in the offensive strategies, the minigun turret is powerful enough\
      \ to stem the tide of the attack and will rack up a lot of kills quickly. The\
      \ turret on the weapon cache is also a nice thing to possess, but not necessary.\
      \ A good squad of attackers can \"run and rocket\" so having someone to backup\
      \ the minigunner would be worth the lack of one man at the bridge truck. Another\
      \ good strategy is to have teams of minigunners on the partition between the\
      \ big pipe and the bridge platform. It's an awful small space for attacks to\
      \ work with, so one person a side should be enough. At the switch it's pretty\
      \ much every man for himself and it's tough to keep track. The bridge itself\
      \ is closed off save for a couple openings with crossbeams so it can be a bottleneck\
      \ for both sides. The door to the repair vessel is tricky to defend if everyone\
      \ on defense isn't on the same page, because two or three attackers can overwhelm\
      \ anyone camped out at the door. Inside, defending the door and the switch is\
      \ easier, and my suggestion is pulse (linked is more effective) and goo. If\
      \ that switch is taken, the offense is given as many as 4 options for getting\
      \ the next switch so defense can be tricky.\n</p><p>Your best chance for stopping\
      \ the attack comes on the missile trailer side. Two difficult-to-attack minigun\
      \ turrets will make attacking difficult in general, and typically attacking\
      \ becomes a one-person-at-a-time affair, which should be easy to handle. Just\
      \ focus on your attacker and make sure there's someone nearby to help. It doesn't\
      \ mean the end of the world if the attackers get into the trailer, but the assault\
      \ will be much tougher to defend if you don't see it coming or where from like\
      \ you will then. If everyone is patient and ready then you shouldn't have a\
      \ problem stopping anyone coming from anywhere.\n</p><p><b><span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:16pt;text-decoration:underline;\"\
      >Conclusion</span></b>\n</p><p>I've had two Dominatings on defense on the missile\
      \ trailer side from manning the minigun turrets. Online I've found that people\
      \ will forget that there are two turrets, but like the saying goes: \"Out of\
      \ sight, out of mind.\" Convoy hinges on these turrets and the haste with which\
      \ the attackers destroy them or the lack of remorse with which the defenders\
      \ wield them. If the turrets are destroyed, the game will boil down to skill\
      \ and grouping. I've done a time trial on the course and I've taken all the\
      \ objectives in under 2 and a half minutes, so if you're attacking or defending\
      \ the last objective with a minute left, you can't just sit back because it\
      \ takes about 15 seconds for those missiles to move out onto the truck that\
      \ awaits them. The trailer is the most difficult objective to take and defend\
      \ and you'll be in for a shock if you don't think so.\n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right;font-style:italic;\"\

      >Layout</span>'''\n\nThe ultimate goal of the attacking team in Convoy is to\
      \ capture the Nexus missiles on the other side of the repair vessel, which is\
      \ where the defending team will spend most of the first four objectives. There\
      \ are three vehicles of importance in Convoy: the repair vessel, the missile\
      \ trailer, and the attacking team's vehicle (has no name). In order to cross\
      \ the span between the attacking vehicle and the repair vessel, the attacking\
      \ team must rotate a bridge by holding a point near the head of the vehicle.\
      \ There are two viable methods for achieving this; go through the cargo of pipes\

      \ mesh netting above said cargo, then jumping onto the large pipe and onto the\

      \ will launch them across the void and right into the heart of the battle. Goings\
      \ will be made easier for the attacking team as a weapon cache just beyond the\
      \ bridge offer better weapons and change the spawn point for a quicker advance.\n\
      \nThe role of minigun turrets in Convoy is huge, especially for the defense.\
      \ The minigun turrets take a little more leading (of the target) to operate,\
      \ but they're more powerful than the handheld weapon and can be devastating\
      \ in the hands of the right person. The attacking team has one such minigun\
      \ turret in their position right from the get go, just ahead and to the right\
      \ of the inital spawn point. Another minigun turret can be made available if\
      \ the forward weapon cache is taken. (This minigun is immediately available\
      \ to the defenders.) The turrets can be destroyed but it requires many rockets\
      \ to do. On the missile trailer side, the defenders have two minigun turrets:\
      \ one at the head of the missile trailer and one above the position from where\
      \ the attackers will be coming.\n\nOnce the bridge is turned and the attackers\
      \ can begin boarding the repair vessel, a long, thin, and exposed walkway brings\
      \ them to the door of the repair vessel, which must be blown up (explosives\
      \ automatically given to you) in order to enter. This is where the quickest\
      \ advance or the longest stand can be held, because of the bottleneck the walkway\
      \ offers. Once the door is blown, the attackers then only have to go a few steps\
      \ to the switch that opens the rear door, moves the spawn point and gives more\
      \ weapons. However, a bottleneck at the door will make progress extremely difficult.\
      \ As the rear door opens, the attackers are faced with a long advance up the\
      \ repair vessel. A gasoline tanker in the middle can be destroyed, which opens\
      \ up the middle and gives the attackers another option. The next switch which\
      \ opens the way to the missile trailer is on the suspended wire-mesh platform\
      \ flanked by health and ammo. Two ramps on the sides lead up to the platform,\
      \ and the switch is at the front of the platform. Two crates also allow for\
      \ quicker access, by jumping up them and onto the platform. The switch opens\
      \ up two doors, one at the front and back of the repair vessel, from where the\
      \ attackers will make their run for the missile trailer.\n\nThe missile trailer\
      \ section has 3 vehicles other than the missile trailer and repair vessel which\
      \ play a part in the attack. Two cargo vehicles supply cover from the minigun\
      \ turrets and connect the way to the missile trailer, as well as health and\
      \ weaponry. Getting past the turret on the missile trailer will bring you to\
      \ health and a small opening in the back of the trailer which drops you into\
      \ the missile chamber itself. Two doors on the sides of the missile trailer\
      \ open up, allowing for the missiles to move through (they go out the right\
      \ side of the trailer) and for people to go in. The third vehicle is a small,\
      \ unprotected tank. Attackers coming out the rear of the repair vessel can jump\
      \ onto the vehicle and ride it either to the head of the missile trailer or\
      \ onto the left door of the trailer. If the turrets are destroyed, the missile\
      \ trailer will be the Alamo of the defense and will be swarming (most likely)\
      \ with many defenders. These openings offer a shorter trip to the missiles and\

      >Attacking Strategies</span>'''\n\nSpeed is the biggest key to attacking in\
      \ Assault, but not just speed to the objectives but speed to making sure the\
      \ defense has a tough time stopping you. In Convoy, the best way to give the\
      \ defense a hard time is by destroying their minigun turrets. Right out of the\
      \ gate, at least one person should make their job expending the rocket launcher\
      \ ammo on the minigun turret on the repair vessel. That way, the defense has\
      \ to earn their frags, not rack them up. The minigun turrets made available\
      \ to the offense are in somewhat ineffective firing positions, though logic\
      \ would lead one to believe that if the defender's minigun turret covers the\
      \ left side of the cargo vehicle and bridge, then the attackers would stay on\
      \ the right side, which would bring the defenders to the right side. Unfortunately,\
      \ I've yet to play a match with people who think logically 100%. For what it's\
      \ worth, however, the minigun turrets can attack each other, and if anyone is\
      \ sniping and is in vision they won't be sniping for long. Ultimately the attacking\
      \ minigun is made pretty useless by its inability to get into the battle, so\
      \ to speak, and shouldn't be manned consistently.\n\n(Ed: willhaven brought\
      \ up the point about the shield gun on the thread about this article on the\

      \ so you don't get killed by someone targetting your toes, which wouldn't be\
      \ protected if you just stood up.)\n\nGetting the bridge rotated is sort of\
      \ the opposite of the \"high road, low road\" Scottish song, in that the high\
      \ road (going on top of the mesh and the pipes) will get you to the bridge quicker\
      \ and will catch the defense unawares, but the high road leaves you much more\
      \ open to the minigun turret, which can slice you down in a hurry. If the turret\
      \ is gone, advancing shouldn't be difficult. Getting the forward weapon cache\
      \ should be one person's job as well. The height of the cache's body should\
      \ provide a good blind spot for you to sneak around the minigun turret, if someone\
      \ is there. Once the cache is taken, taking the bridge objective shouldn't be\
      \ tough. The walkway is tougher but flak and rocket discipline should pave the\
      \ way for progress. Equally tough is opening the rear door. I've found that\
      \ defenders will pay attention to anyone in the opposite color scheme, so what\
      \ I try to do is get into the vessel and draw as many guys away by running as\
      \ far back as possible. If I make it to the next objective switch (which you\
      \ can't take until the previous objective is taken), I'll fire down the hall\
      \ (with anything; mini, flak, pulse) which will kill defenders or, again, get\
      \ their attention away from the door. Try it and see if it works for you. Once\
      \ the rear door objective is taken, jump up the crates near the platform for\
      \ a quicker and less attention-grabbing way to the switch.\n\nThe missile trailer\
      \ is the toughest vehicle to breach because now you've got two minigun turrets\
      \ in tough positions with no rockets (but typically flak) to take them out easily.\
      \ The way to the trailer doesn't offer a lot of cover from either, so you'll\
      \ have to be quick and go in guns blazing. The minigun turret above where you'll\
      \ begin your assault on the trailer is the easier of the two to destroy because\
      \ you can't be directly stopped by the turret itself. Lobbing flak bombs up\
      \ there won't be an exact science most of the time but when you hit it'll hurt.\
      \ Other than that, your best bet is to go in groups: one takes the left of the\
      \ trailer, one takes the right. Eventually this strategy should get you inside\
      \ the missile trailer, which will then make things easier and tougher at the\
      \ same time. You'll have three openings: the hole you just jumped through and\
      \ two doors which open on the sides of the trailers. Most of the defense will\
      \ make their stand inside the trailer, so you'll be faced with a more specific\
      \ defensive unit. Near the opening of the hole, there's health, a weapon locker,\
      \ and a jumper which will put you back to the hole. My strategy for this part\
      \ is to go into the missile trailer on one of the two doors, fire away while\
      \ falling back, use the jumper and repeat. This will weaken or kill the defenders\
      \ leaving your teammates to clean up and take the objective.\n\n'''<span style=\"\
      font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:16pt;text-decoration:underline;\">Defensive\
      \ Strategies</span>'''\n\nAs soon as possible someone should be on the minigun\
      \ turret and, if possible, a sniper to cover the minigunner. As I said in the\
      \ offensive strategies, the minigun turret is powerful enough to stem the tide\
      \ of the attack and will rack up a lot of kills quickly. The turret on the weapon\
      \ cache is also a nice thing to possess, but not necessary. A good squad of\
      \ attackers can \"run and rocket\" so having someone to backup the minigunner\
      \ would be worth the lack of one man at the bridge truck. Another good strategy\
      \ is to have teams of minigunners on the partition between the big pipe and\
      \ the bridge platform. It's an awful small space for attacks to work with, so\
      \ one person a side should be enough. At the switch it's pretty much every man\
      \ for himself and it's tough to keep track. The bridge itself is closed off\
      \ save for a couple openings with crossbeams so it can be a bottleneck for both\
      \ sides. The door to the repair vessel is tricky to defend if everyone on defense\
      \ isn't on the same page, because two or three attackers can overwhelm anyone\
      \ camped out at the door. Inside, defending the door and the switch is easier,\
      \ and my suggestion is pulse (linked is more effective) and goo. If that switch\
      \ is taken, the offense is given as many as 4 options for getting the next switch\
      \ so defense can be tricky.\n\nYour best chance for stopping the attack comes\
      \ on the missile trailer side. Two difficult-to-attack minigun turrets will\
      \ make attacking difficult in general, and typically attacking becomes a one-person-at-a-time\
      \ affair, which should be easy to handle. Just focus on your attacker and make\
      \ sure there's someone nearby to help. It doesn't mean the end of the world\
      \ if the attackers get into the trailer, but the assault will be much tougher\
      \ to defend if you don't see it coming or where from like you will then. If\
      \ everyone is patient and ready then you shouldn't have a problem stopping anyone\
      \ coming from anywhere.\n\n'''<span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:16pt;text-decoration:underline;\"\
      >Conclusion</span>'''\n\nI've had two Dominatings on defense on the missile\
      \ trailer side from manning the minigun turrets. Online I've found that people\
      \ will forget that there are two turrets, but like the saying goes: \"Out of\
      \ sight, out of mind.\" Convoy hinges on these turrets and the haste with which\
      \ the attackers destroy them or the lack of remorse with which the defenders\
      \ wield them. If the turrets are destroyed, the game will boil down to skill\
      \ and grouping. I've done a time trial on the course and I've taken all the\
      \ objectives in under 2 and a half minutes, so if you're attacking or defending\
      \ the last objective with a minute left, you can't just sit back because it\
      \ takes about 15 seconds for those missiles to move out onto the truck that\
      \ awaits them. The trailer is the most difficult objective to take and defend\
      \ and you'll be in for a shock if you don't think so.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:right;font-style:italic;\"\
