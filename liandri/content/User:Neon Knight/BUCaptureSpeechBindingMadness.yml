    text: "<p>Originally posted in the old Capture website, at capture.beyondunreal.com,\
      \ now defunct. I had a copy in my backups.\n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;font-size:18pt;font-weight:bold;\"\
      >Speech Binding Madness!</div>\n<p><br />\nHave you ever seen someone that joins\
      \ a public server and immediately start typing out their location and there\
      \ exact amount of health while they move around the map? These \"status\" messages\
      \ can be incredibly useful for teamwork, allowing teammates to coordinate their\
      \ positions with their flag carrier or incoming enemies, without typing or using\
      \ a voice communications program. This article will show you how to make these\
      \ messages and other useful things to do with custom binds.\n</p><p>First of\
      \ all, you'll need a pure-text capable editor; any version of Windows Notepad\
      \ will do just fine. Open your UT2003 directory with the editor, then go to\
      \ your System folder, and open user.ini. This is one of your main configuration\
      \ files for UT2003 (the other being UT2003.ini) and in here, you can change\
      \ key bindings, weapon preferences, player name (in fact, if you want to add\
      \ fancy characters to your name, here's the place you can copy and paste them\
      \ into under [DefaultPlayer] Name=). However, before playing around with these\
      \ settings, you'll want to make a backup copy of this file in the event that\
      \ something goes wrong. Now that we are all backed up, let's make a status bind\
      \ so you'll look cool in the pubs!.\n</p><p>UT2003 supports several different\
      \ variables that you can call to within your bind that will update according\
      \ to your current status. These are\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">%l\
      \ - gives the location of the player<br />\n%s - gives the number of shield\
      \ points the player has<br />\n%h - gives the health of the player<br />\n%w\
      \ - gives the current weapon that the player has out<br />\n%a - gives the current\
      \ adrenaline that the player has</p>\n<p>These are then inserted into the line\
      \ that corresponds to the key that is being used to activate it. You can use\
      \ the commands \"say\" and \"teamsay\" before entering a phrase that you want\
      \ to have your character say (the same effect as typing it out by hand each\
      \ time), and then comes the variable. For example, if you wanted the 'G' key\
      \ to give your status with health and shield, as well as your location, but\
      \ dont want all this information to be put on the same line in game, you would\
      \ enter this into your [Engine.Input] down where the 'G' key is listed after\
      \ the Aliases section:\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>G=teamsay STATUS&gt;&gt;&#160;%h,&#160;%s\
      \ | teamsay LOCATION&gt;&gt;&#160;%l</b></p>\n<p>The '|' in the middle is the\
      \ equivalent of a new line, so when this is used in game, it will show up as\
      \ such. \n</p><p>You can play around with these variables until you have something\
      \ that suits your needs, but remember to be considerate and not make them take\
      \ up too many lines when used, because you'll most likely use a bind like this\
      \ more than once per minute in the heat of a battle. The teamsay variables (health,\
      \ shield, location, etc.) usually only work in team games like CTF, BR, and\
      \ TDM, but when pressed in a DM match, they only print the variable (%h) rather\
      \ than the actual value associated with it (50 Health).\n</p><p>The teamsay\
      \ and say can be used on their own, to convey a message like \"Link Me\" or\
      \ \"What's your status?\" that don't require variables in them (see the Link\
      \ Gun tip for a more specific example).\n</p><p>The various speech binds can\
      \ be bound to specific keys, too. This can be done through UT2003's GUI (Go\
      \ to Settings -&gt; Speech from the Main Menu), or can be done through the User.ini\
      \ using the list found below:\n</p><p>Usage example&#160;: <b>\"G=speech 0 0\"\
      </b> (without the quotes).\n</p><p>Here is the list of sayings I figured out\
      \ so far:\n</p><p>\"speech 0 0\"- Base is uncovered<br />\n\"speech 0 1\"- Get\
      \ our flag back<br />\n\"speech 0 2\"- Ive got the flag<br />\n\"speech 0 3\"\

      \ to within your bind that will update according to your current status. These\
      \ are\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">%l - gives the location of the player<br>\n\

      \ of the player<br>\n%w - gives the current weapon that the player has out<br>\n\
      %a - gives the current adrenaline that the player has</p>\n\nThese are then\
      \ inserted into the line that corresponds to the key that is being used to activate\
      \ it. You can use the commands \"say\" and \"teamsay\" before entering a phrase\

      The '|' can be used to seperate lines and you can add additional text to the\
      \ speech, like this:\n\n'''F1=speech OTHER 12 | teamsay STATUS>> %H, %S | teamsay\
      \ LOCATION>> %L'''\n\nBeware though, the number of voice commands you can use\
      \ in a certain time window is limited, so you may not want to bind all your\
      \ status commands in with a speech command, unless you are prepared to have\
      \ a delay in the usage.\n\nStatus and speech binds can be used very effectively\
      \ to coordinate teamwork, or can be the source of much annoyance to other players.\
      \ Make sure not to abuse the ability to modify client-side settings by spamming\
      \ these messages incessantly. Have fun, and if you have any questions about\
      \ the binds covered here, feel free to leave a comment below!  \n\n<div style=\"\
