      \ is situated on a second level of a large opened room. The flag is accessible\
      \ via ramps flanking both sides of the flag, a jump pad that is situated in\
      \ front of the flag , and an elevator located in back of the flag. The Lightning\

      \ holds rockets, flak shells, health, and the Shock Rifle. These tight corridors\
      \ make the Shock Rifle the weapon of choice, and will therefore force flag carriers\
      \ to come with cover if they want to make it through alive.\n</p><p>Once inside\

      \ it is best for flag runners to take advantage of the cover that the upper\
