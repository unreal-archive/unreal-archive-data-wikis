      \ for you, everybody wants it, few know what it is, and fewer still know how\
      \ to achieve it with complete strangers. What is it? Money? Orgies? Ability\
      \ to sing on tune? No, no, and no! The thing I'm talking is teamwork. With the\
      \ ability to use voice communication, this concept has spawned a sub-game with\
      \ UT2004: <i>Do It My Way!</i> The object of this game is to scream and holler\
      \ so loudly and persistently that all the lone rangers on your team will stop\
      \ waiting for the Raptor to spawn and follow you. Where? To Victory, of course!\
      \ From the looks of most servers, no one has been able to scream loud enough\
      \ to succeed at this game, and so today I will try to point out some alternative\
      \ methods for you to achieve victory on any Public Server.\n</p><p>When I get\
      \ annoyed, I get cranky, and when I get upset, and when I'm upset, I cry, and\
      \ when I cry, I can't see the screen, and when I can't see the screen, I don't\
      \ play very well. Being last on the scoreboard is not going to compel those\
      \ unruly players into cooperating with you any more then your screaming does.\
      \ You can't join a server and be number one, and so it is wise to try to help\
      \ other players in their endeavors when you first join a server to try and build\
      \ their trust in you. No one likes someone who barges in and tries to run the\
      \ show right off the bat. If you wait five minutes before you start spewing\
      \ out the commands, maybe they'll listen to you, the respected teammate, whereas\
      \ they'll ignore Private \"Green as the Grass\" Gumshoe.\n</p><p>So you've earned\
      \ some respect, and the guy you were following has died...It is now your chance\
      \ to take some leadership on the battlefield. However, now is not the time to\
      \ abandon your previous objective in favor of what you think needs to be done.\
      \ Be sure to finish whatever you were doing when your old leader perished. After\
      \ you successfully complete it, feel free to move on to whatever goal you have\
      \ in that sturdy block of wood of yours.\n</p><p>The world we live in is not\
      \ a utopia, and it will never be one. Because of this sad fact, you have to\
      \ come to terms with that fact that your team will not work like a clan that's\
      \ been playing together for three years. Accept it and move on. Once you realize\
      \ that not everyone is there to win, you'll be able to get more achieved with\
      \ the players that do care. Instead of spamming \"WE NEED DEFENSE\" fifteen\
      \ times, you need to realize that if they don't react after the first two messages,\
      \ they are either dead and you need to call 911, or they just don't care and\
      \ will probably never care; In fact, they are probably laughing at you for trying\
      \ to accomplish an impossible endeavor. When you find a player that wants to\
      \ be free as the wind, just ignore him and focus on your other teammates. The\
      \ ability to ignore block someone out of your Voice Communication is perfect\
      \ for these instances.\n</p><p>When you find a few players that want to work\
      \ with you, be sure to not become the leader from hell. Whenever you call out\
      \ an order, try and achieve that objective yourself with the help of whoever\
      \ wants to help. It's no fair for you to be out flying around in a Raptor while\
      \ you are spamming <i>Defend the base, god dammit you n00bs!!</i>. Remember\
      \ that you have to follow your own orders before anyone else will.\n</p><p>Be\
      \ sure to make sure that a vehicle’s seats are completely filled with bodies\
      \ before you drive off to the battlefield. It will make conquering the objective\
      \ easier, and let you both live longer. It's a great team building exercise\
      \ and helps you earn respect in your teammates’ eyes. Never get in a large vehicle\
      \ and drive off until you are sure no one else wants a ride. It's inconsiderate,\
      \ and shows just how selfish you are. Remember, the more the merrier.\n</p><p>Teamwork\
      \ is a great thing, and surprisingly enough, pubs are a great place to build\
      \ your skills with it. The constant turn-over rate of players gives just about\
      \ every player the chance to lead as well as the chance to follow another. If\
      \ you apply these lessons to your pub experience, you'll have your randomly\
      \ assigned team doing synchronous maneuvers like the Blue Angels as you lead\
      \ the team to victory. \n</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:right;font-style:italic;\"\
