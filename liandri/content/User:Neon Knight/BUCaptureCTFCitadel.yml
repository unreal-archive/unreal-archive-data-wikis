      <p>Citadel is considered by the many to be the CTF-Face of Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003. It is a relatively open and free-form map, which lends itself to being\
      \ an excellent map to use the Lightning Gun and Rocket Launcher. Flak spammers\
      \ need look elsewhere, for the beloved Flak Cannons are nowhere to be found.\
      \ Shock Rifles and Miniguns adorn the lower bridges, while the flag bases are\
      \ host to the dreaded Bio-rifle.\n</p><p>The flag bases have three entrances\
      \ and exits. To enter, an opponent can choose to go through the side routes\
      \ connected to the Shock Rifle and Minigun bridges, or they can drop through\
      \ hole that is right above the flag. Once inside the base, the flag runner has\
      \ the option of taking either side exit which returns them to the Shock and\
      \ Minigun bridges, or they can take the teleporter directly across from the\
      \ flag. The teleporter spits them out on top of their enemy’s tower. This is\
      \ where the Lightening Gun and Super Shield reside. From here, the flag runner\
      \ has many options as to which paths by which they can return to their home\
      \ base. The weapon of choice at the top of this tower is the Shield Gun which\
      \ can be used to effectively knock off or kill unsuspecting snipers. The secondary\
      \ fire can be used to shield the flag carrier as they jump from the tower. While\
      \ jumping, the flag carrier can land on the side spikes which are located at\
      \ 90 degree angles from the teleporter. They can also land on the spokes at\
      \ the bottom of the base or on the spokes of the tower base.\n</p><p>From the\
      \ team “mesa” the flag carrier can either choose to keep their shield gun out,\
      \ and fall on the tops of the base openings leading from the lower bridges and\
      \ make a run for it down those routes, or continue down the middle bridge. Make\
      \ sure to dodge while making your runs, but not so much as to fall off the bridges!\
      \ I find that by turning about 90 degrees and then side dodging works best,\
      \ because I'm weak and unable to forward dodge very easily. Once back in their\
      \ home base, the flag carrier can attempt to hideout behind the tower on the\
      \ “Adrenaline claws” or they can try their luck at staying just inside the side\
      \ entrances. I would not recommend staying in one place too long, especially\
      \ on the tower, but careful circles from the tower and Super Shield to the ground\
      \ via Shield secondary, then through the 'O' portal, and to the health or teleporter\
      \ again, etc. Make sure to mix it up to keep the other team guessing, but hopefully\
      \ it will all pay off with an all-powerful flag cap.\n</p><p>Due to the versatility\
      \ of the upper levels and middle bridge, when defending, this should be a priority,\
      \ ranking right up there with the flag room itself. If you camp the towers,\
      \ you'll be easy bait for the snipers and Shield Gun-wielding flag runners,\
      \ so you'll have to keep moving if you want to control the middle. However,\
      \ if you're in a camping mood no matter what, you might try getting up to the\
      \ top of the opposing team's tower and translocate to the top of their teleporter.\
      \ You'll be able to score a few cheap shots to the back before they figure it\
      \ out, but it may just be enough to satisfy your camping urges.\n</p><p>Inside\

      \ the 'O', which can be heard by those inside. When this happens, load up a\
      \ syringe of goo with the Biorifle or fill the room with shock combos. Avoid\
      \ standing at the Bio-rifle pickup base or ammo pile on the other side of the\
      \ teleporter, because those are usually the first targets of dropping flag runners.\
