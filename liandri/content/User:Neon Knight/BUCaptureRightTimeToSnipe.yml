      \ Your Position Secret</b><br />\nIf you are a good sniper…you don’t want your\
      \ position to be known by anyone else on the other team. The only real way to\
      \ keep yourself hidden is to put a lightning bolt through the BACK of your enemy’\
      s head…that way he doesn’t know where it came from. When your enemy comes out\
      \ again you know he will be looking for you, so hide. After a little while you\
      \ can poke your head out again. After the other team knows your position, you\
      \ might as well find a new spot because they will be on the lookout for you.\n\
      </p><p><b>Electrifying Flag Kills</b><br />\nIf your team doesn’t have someone\
      \ that is constantly on sniper duty, you have to think about one thing when\
      \ your flag gets out of the base. Is the flag carrier close enough to base where\
      \ you can track him down and kill him close range? If you know for a fact that\
      \ he is not close enough…the only option you have left is to put a lightning\
      \ rod through his skull. Another thing you need to keep in mind is after you\
      \ kill the flag carrier, who is going to return it? You either need to be quick\
      \ with the Translocator or you need someone else out mid-field waiting to get\
      \ the return.\n</p><p><b>Be a Distraction</b><br />\nSometimes a good thing\
      \ to do when you have the sniper job is to distract the other team when your\
      \ flag carrier exits their base. It gives them something else to worry about\
      \ and some more bullets to dodge. Or instead of just being a distraction, you\
      \ might want to provide some cover for your flag carrier by putting bullets\
      \ through everyone’s head.\n</p><p><b>Zooming</b><br />\nThis is a very simple\
      \ mistake that everyone makes. Never zoom in all the way unless you are in a\
      \ gigantic wide-open map. This is because if you are zoomed in all the way,\
      \ fire and miss, your target jumps out of your view very quickly. The best thing\
      \ to do is zoom in about halfway and if that doesn’t get you close enough then\
      \ go a little closer…but never all the way in if you are on a medium sized map.\
