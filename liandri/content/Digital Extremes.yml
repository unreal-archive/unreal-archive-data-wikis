      \ craze) the Canadian game developer <a href=\"/James_Schmalz\" title=\"James\
      \ Schmalz\">James Schmalz</a> developed a series of shareware games, which were\
      \ published by several different companies. After a venture with Big Blue Disc,\
      \ James went to then <a href=\"/Epic_Games\" title=\"Epic Games\">Epic MegaGames</a>\
      \ to release 2 of his games: Solar Winds and a game called <a rel=\"nofollow\"\
      \ class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Pinball\"\
      >Epic Pinball</a>. The latter became a huge hit, and gave James the opportunity\
      \ (and the money) to start his own company: Digital Extremes.\nThe first games\
      \ developed by DE were pinball games (including the sequel to Epic Pinball)\
      \ and a revolutionary new 3d-shooter that later became known as Unreal. 4 years\
      \ after James Schmalz developed the first Unreal demo, the game was released,\
      \ bringing in another success for DE.\n</p><p>In 2001, Digital Extremes formed\
      \ a second studio in Toronto, Ontario to focus on developing console games.\
      \ The new studio was named Brain Box Games, but this later became the name of\
      \ a small division of the Toronto studio that focused on budget games. Since\
      \ then, the Toronto studio was renamed to Digital Extremes Toronto, and the\
      \ primary studio in London was renamed to Digital Extremes London.\n</p><p>The\
      \ partnership with Epic proved to be fruitful, and they continued to work together\
      \ on Unreal Tournament and Unreal Tournament 2 (which was later renamed to UT2003\
      \ / Unreal Championship.) Halfway through the development it became clear that\
      \ both games would be finished faster if each team was dedicated to one specific\
      \ game. DE then took over UC, while Epic finished UT2003.\n</p><p>After these\
      \ games, DE started to focus on it's own franchises: The Toronto studio worked\
      \ on their first-person shooter Pariah while the London studio was still working\
      \ on Dark Sector. After Pariah finished development, the Toronto studio began\
      \ working on Pariah: Shroud Wars. Unfortunately, since Pariah was a commercial\
      \ flop, Shroud Wars was renamed WarPath and took on a new life as a whole new\
      \ game.\nIn 2005, the London and Toronto studios merged so that they could both\
      \ work together on WarPath and Dark Sector. Warpath was released a year later,\
      \ while Dark Sector was released in 2008. During the final years of Dark Sector's\
      \ development, Epic started to work on the 3rd generation UT title: <a href=\"\
      /Unreal_Tournament_3\" title=\"Unreal Tournament 3\">Unreal Tournament 3</a>.\
      \ This ended up being the first title in the UT series that wasn't co-developed\
      \ by DE.\n</p><p>On July 3, 2008, 2K Games announced a partnership with Digital\
