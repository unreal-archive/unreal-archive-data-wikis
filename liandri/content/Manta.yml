      <p>The Manta is one of the six vehicles introduced in <a href=\"/Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Unreal Tournament 2004\">Unreal Tournament 2004</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Description\">Description</span><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Manta?section=2\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Description\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The <a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">Manta</a> is\
      \ a very lightweight, very agile hovercraft-type vehicle.  It has neither strong\
      \ armor (200 <a href=\"/Health\" title=\"Health\">HP</a>) nor much firepower.\
      \ Its main strength is its agility. Due to this, it is mainly feared by infantry\
      \ which can easily get squished by the Manta.\n</p><p>The Manta's fans suck\
      \ in the ribbon which the <a href=\"/Scorpion\" title=\"Scorpion\">Scorpion</a>\
      \ shoots and receives additional damage from it. However, if the Manta can stay\
      \ away far enough it can dodge the Scorpion's shots and kill it with ease. \
      \ Part of being a good Manta pilot involves keeping your Manta serviceable for\
      \ as long as possible, while knowing when to dump the Manta before it is too\
      \ late.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jumping\">Jumping</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Manta?section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Jumping\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Unlike wheeled vehicles,\
      \ the Manta is able to jump.  When the jump key is pressed, the Manta will quickly\
      \ rise several feet into the air, and gently float back down to the surface.\
      \  This move is useful to allow the Manta to ascend steeper hills and cliffs,\
      \ and also to position the vehicle over an enemy's head to perform a pancake.\
      \  After a jump has been performed, the pilot must wait a few seconds, as indicated\
      \ by a bar gauge, before the Manta is ready to jump again.  Also, a jump can\
      \ only be performed when the vehicle hovering just above the ground or water\
      \ surface.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Pancake.21\">Pancake!</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Manta?section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Pancake!\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Aside from the usual\
      \ method of killing enemies by running into them with the vehicle, a more challenging\
      \ and more fun method of killing enemies is to pancake them.  This can be done\
      \ by positioning the Manta above the enemy by jumping, and then using the alternate\
      \ fire or the crouch key to quickly descend, crushing the player like a pancake\
      \ and doing so much damage that the hit is almost always an instant kill.\n\
      </p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Primary_Fire\">Primary Fire</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Manta?section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Primary Fire\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The primary fire\
      \ shoots a plasma projectile from the front of the Manta that does 30 damage\
      \ with a direct hit.  Although an individual plasma projectile does not do much\
      \ damage on its own, the vehicle's rapid firing rate will allow the pilot to\
      \ quickly chip away the health of an enemy or the energy of a power node rather\
      \ easily.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Usage_in_Vehicle_CTF\"\
      >Usage in Vehicle CTF</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Manta?section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Usage in Vehicle\

      <p>If a flag carrier enters a Manta in <a href=\"/Vehicle_Capture_the_Flag\"\
      \ title=\"Vehicle Capture the Flag\">VCTF</a>, he drops the flag immediately,\
      \ just like he does when he enters a <a href=\"/Raptor\" title=\"Raptor\">Raptor</a>\
      \ or <a href=\"/Cicada\" title=\"Cicada\">Cicada</a>.  This is due to balancing,\
      \ because a Manta driver could quickly get out of range of everyone and would\
      \ therefore be nearly uncatchable. \n</p><p>The Manta can also be useful for\
      \ squishing enemy flag carriers, especially if the carrier is distracted by\
      \ other players.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Manta_Run\">Manta\
      \ Run</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Manta?section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Manta Run\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Although\
      \ a flag can't be transported in a Manta, in UT2004 a flag carrier can stand\
      \ on either one the Manta's wings or (more infrequently) on top of the Manta\
      \ so the driver can transport them. This is commonly called a Manta run. Some\
      \ people see the Manta run as an exploit, yet some see it as a valid tactic,\
      \ so most VCTF servers allow Manta runs. In UT3 Manta runs are no longer possible.\
      \ Players that try to stand on the wings will get sucked into the rotor and\
      \ turned into gibs.\n</p><p>Manta runs are also useful in <a href=\"/Onslaught\"\
      \ title=\"Onslaught\">Onslaught</a> when vehicles are rare and the team needs\
      \ to get to the front as fast as possible.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\"\
      \ id=\"Manta_Jettison_Attack\">Manta Jettison Attack</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Manta Jettison Attack\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Sometimes Mantas can get low health quite quickly,\
      \ and you want to be sure you take down your enemies before your die in the\
      \ vehicle. To do a Manta Jettison, simply use Alt-Fire, until you get close\
      \ to the opponent, then exit the vehicle, the manta will go flying into the\
      \ enemy, crushing them. Also, you can use this if you don't want to take damage,\
      \ but want to make a suprise attack. Then after using, you can go back in the\
      \ Manta, its like a frisbee, except with spikes and blades. Not to mention that\
      \ incoming AVRiL missiles will lose their target lock since they can't home\
      \ in on an unmanned vehicle.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Manta_Minelayer\"\
      >Manta Minelayer</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >[</span><a href=\"/edit/Manta?section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Manta Minelayer\"\
      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Mantas\
      \ can also be used as transports for Mines from the mine layer, just shoot them\
      \ at the wings. Maximum of 3 mines per wing, otherwise the fourth one will explode\
      \ causing nearby damage. So you can take a quick trip to a powernode and defeat\
      \ any pesky units that stand in your way.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ and <a href=\"/Scorpion\" title=\"Scorpion\">Scorpion</a> are your most feared\
      \ enemies. Raptor missiles are possible to dodge with some practice.  The AVRiL\
      \ shot is slow enough that it can be jumped over with the correct timing, but\
      \ be wary of lock-ons hitting you in the back afterward. The Manta is often\
      \ fast enough to get behind cover to avoid either type of missile. The Scorpion's\

      \ fast smaller vehicles such as the <a href=\"/Scavenger\" title=\"Scavenger\"\

      | mainuses    = Offense, Transport, Annoyance\n}}\n\nThe Manta is one of the\
      \ six vehicles introduced in [[Unreal Tournament 2004]].\n\n=== Description\
      \ ===\nThe [[Manta]] is a very lightweight, very agile hovercraft-type vehicle.\
      \  It has neither strong armor (200 [[Health|HP]]) nor much firepower. Its main\
      \ strength is its agility. Due to this, it is mainly feared by infantry which\
      \ can easily get squished by the Manta.\n\nThe Manta's fans suck in the ribbon\
      \ which the [[Scorpion]] shoots and receives additional damage from it. However,\
      \ if the Manta can stay away far enough it can dodge the Scorpion's shots and\
      \ kill it with ease.  Part of being a good Manta pilot involves keeping your\
      \ Manta serviceable for as long as possible, while knowing when to dump the\
      \ Manta before it is too late.\n\n=== Jumping ===\nUnlike wheeled vehicles,\
      \ the Manta is able to jump.  When the jump key is pressed, the Manta will quickly\
      \ rise several feet into the air, and gently float back down to the surface.\
      \  This move is useful to allow the Manta to ascend steeper hills and cliffs,\
      \ and also to position the vehicle over an enemy's head to perform a pancake.\
      \  After a jump has been performed, the pilot must wait a few seconds, as indicated\
      \ by a bar gauge, before the Manta is ready to jump again.  Also, a jump can\
      \ only be performed when the vehicle hovering just above the ground or water\
      \ surface.\n\n=== Pancake! ===\nAside from the usual method of killing enemies\
      \ by running into them with the vehicle, a more challenging and more fun method\
      \ of killing enemies is to pancake them.  This can be done by positioning the\
      \ Manta above the enemy by jumping, and then using the alternate fire or the\
      \ crouch key to quickly descend, crushing the player like a pancake and doing\
      \ so much damage that the hit is almost always an instant kill.\n\n=== Primary\
      \ Fire ===\nThe primary fire shoots a plasma projectile from the front of the\
      \ Manta that does 30 damage with a direct hit.  Although an individual plasma\
      \ projectile does not do much damage on its own, the vehicle's rapid firing\
      \ rate will allow the pilot to quickly chip away the health of an enemy or the\
      \ energy of a power node rather easily.\n\n=== Usage in Vehicle CTF ===\nIf\
      \ a flag carrier enters a Manta in [[Vehicle Capture the Flag|VCTF]], he drops\
      \ the flag immediately, just like he does when he enters a [[Raptor]] or [[Cicada]].\
      \  This is due to balancing, because a Manta driver could quickly get out of\
      \ range of everyone and would therefore be nearly uncatchable. \n\nThe Manta\
      \ can also be useful for squishing enemy flag carriers, especially if the carrier\
      \ is distracted by other players.\n\n==== Manta Run ====\nAlthough a flag can't\
      \ be transported in a Manta, in UT2004 a flag carrier can stand on either one\
      \ the Manta's wings or (more infrequently) on top of the Manta so the driver\
      \ can transport them. This is commonly called a Manta run. Some people see the\
      \ Manta run as an exploit, yet some see it as a valid tactic, so most VCTF servers\
      \ allow Manta runs. In UT3 Manta runs are no longer possible. Players that try\
      \ to stand on the wings will get sucked into the rotor and turned into gibs.\n\
      \nManta runs are also useful in [[Onslaught]] when vehicles are rare and the\
      \ team needs to get to the front as fast as possible.\n\n==== Manta Jettison\
      \ Attack ====\nSometimes Mantas can get low health quite quickly, and you want\
      \ to be sure you take down your enemies before your die in the vehicle. To do\
      \ a Manta Jettison, simply use Alt-Fire, until you get close to the opponent,\
      \ then exit the vehicle, the manta will go flying into the enemy, crushing them.\
      \ Also, you can use this if you don't want to take damage, but want to make\
      \ a suprise attack. Then after using, you can go back in the Manta, its like\
      \ a frisbee, except with spikes and blades. Not to mention that incoming AVRiL\
      \ missiles will lose their target lock since they can't home in on an unmanned\
      \ vehicle.\n\n==== Manta Minelayer ====\nMantas can also be used as transports\
      \ for Mines from the mine layer, just shoot them at the wings. Maximum of 3\
      \ mines per wing, otherwise the fourth one will explode causing nearby damage.\
      \ So you can take a quick trip to a powernode and defeat any pesky units that\
      \ stand in your way.\n\n== Unreal Tournament 3 ==\n{{Infobox Vehicle\n| name\
      \        = Manta\n| image       = [[Image:UT3 manta.png|200px]]\n| health  \

      \ armor and unmatched agility, the [[Axon]] IFV Manta has repeatedly proven\
      \ itself on battlefields across the galaxy. \n<br /><br />\nThe Manta is propelled\
      \ by two flush-mounted, magnetically impelled fans which can be instantly pitched,\
      \ allowing the vehicle to leap high into the air, then quickly duck below incoming\
      \ obstacles or enemy fire. \n<br /><br />\nIts superior agility is paired with\
      \ two multi-stage plasma casters that burn hot and reload quickly, making the\
      \ Manta particularly effective in suppressing enemy infantry.|[[UT3]] manual}}\n\
      \n=== Using the Manta ===\nThe manta is highly maneuverable and can dodge most\
      \ types of enemy fire. The [[AVRiL]], [[Raptor]], and [[Scorpion]] are your\
      \ most feared enemies. Raptor missiles are possible to dodge with some practice.\
      \  The AVRiL shot is slow enough that it can be jumped over with the correct\
      \ timing, but be wary of lock-ons hitting you in the back afterward. The Manta\
      \ is often fast enough to get behind cover to avoid either type of missile.\
      \ The Scorpion's mortars are often most effective weapon against the Manta,\
      \ as they home in very strongly, making dodging them difficult or impossible.\
      \ Usually, staying out of range of Scorpions is the best strategy.\n\nThe Manta's\
      \ high speed and acceleration make it very valuable for flag or orb runs.\n\n\
      The Manta is great for notching up vehicular manslaughters, pancakes, and road\
      \ rages. It is the perfect anti-infantry weapon; it will probably rack up more\
      \ kills than the redeemer if used properly.\n\nIt is also great for taking out\
      \ fast smaller vehicles such as the [[Scavenger]] or [[Viper]] because it can\
      \ keep up in speed and chip away their armor with its plasma guns. Be wary of\
      \ Vipers trying to kamikaze into you if they're losing the fight, as an explosion\
      \ even close to the Manta will probably severely damage if not kill you outright.\n\
      \n=== Going against the Manta ===\nIf you have the [[AVRiL]] or are in a [[Raptor]]\
      \ and there's at least some distance between you and the Manta, you have almost\
      \ won.\n\nYou may also have a chance by charging up the [[Impact Hammer]]'s\
      \ EMP mode and letting the Manta run into it. Fully charged this will push back\
      \ the Manta and severely damage it. Afterwards you can switch to a different\
      \ weapon, for example the [[Flak Cannon]], to finish it off.\n\nThe [[Darkwalker]]'s\
      \ secondary \"horn\" attack will push the driver out of the Manta.\n\nThe [[Scorpion]]\
      \ is also an excellent weapon against Mantas since its mortars home onto them\
      \ and 2-3 shots are enough to kill the driver or Manta.\n\nAlso, a lucky shot\
      \ with the sniper rifle can headshot the pilot out of the cockpit.\n{{Vehicles}}"
