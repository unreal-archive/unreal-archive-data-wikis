      \ rock suspended in the sky by some unknown force. The rock is riddled with\
      \ caves, and it is these underground ways that the player must explore first.\
      \ Within the caves, a waterfall from some unknown source cascades down into\
      \ the sky below.</dd>\n<dt> Note</dt>\n<dd> The title of this map, and the map\
      \ that follows it, suggests that the name \"<a href=\"/Na_Pali\" title=\"Na\
      \ Pali\">Na Pali</a>\" was originally only intended to be attributed to this\
      \ sky island. However, \"Na Pali\" has since entered canon as the name of the\

      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>The Sunspire is just a memory now... your passage in the SkyElevator\
      \ has brought you to a series of beautiful caves beneath the <a href=\"/Na_Pali_Haven\"\
      \ title=\"Na Pali Haven\">Na Pali Haven</a>, a town on a rock that floats serenely\
      \ in the sky. Time to move on... you can't stay here, however beautiful the\
      \ scenery.\n</p><p>You start in the SkyElevator. Walk to the elevator door,\
      \ and it opens slowly to reveal a cave; beneath you is a hole to sky below,\
      \ which you can cross once a wooden bridge which comes across from solid ground\
      \ within the cave has finished its movement. Crossing the bridge, you will be\
      \ on a ring of solid ground within the cave around the hole in the centre, with\
      \ a tunnel entrance directly ahead.\n</p><p>Before taking the tunnel entrance,\
      \ walk round the ring to collect two <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flares</a>\
      \ and to raid barrels for a Clip and a Health Pack. When you're done, go into\
      \ the tunnel entrance.\n</p><p>The tunnel climbs a slope then curves round to\
      \ the right into a straight flat section that leads out to the edge of the Na\
      \ Pali rock, where a wooden platform is a viewing balcony over the sky below.\
      \ A <a href=\"/Nali\" title=\"Nali\">Nali</a> stands on a plank here, watched\
      \ over by a pair of <a href=\"/Krall\" title=\"Krall\">Krall</a> guards. As\
      \ you approach, one of the Krall will try to knock the Nali out into space.\
      \ You can stop him, but then the Nali is afraid and jumps off anyway, so there's\
      \ nothing you can do for him.\n</p><p>Kill the Krall guards using your <a href=\"\
      /Enforcer\" title=\"Enforcer\">Automag</a>. They're not that tough, easy enemies\
      \ as long as you avoid their weapons. Go out on to the viewing balcony when\
      \ the Krall are dead, and go to either side there to collect two Clips and a\
      \ <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a>.\n</p><p>Return\
      \ to the main tunnel and go along until you see a heavy metal door on the right.\
      \ The door opens as you approach, so go up the tunnel beyond. Climb the slope.\
      \ As you turn the corner at the top into an area where a rickety plank bridge\
      \ crosses a pool, a Krall will see you and attempt to run away for support.\
      \ Take him down before he can.\n</p><p>Two barrels at the base of the bridge\
      \ reveal a pair of ASMD Cores. When you have collected the Cores, try to climb\
      \ the bridge - go via the longitudinal support struts, because the cross planks\
      \ are weak and can easily break, chucking you into the water below. If you do\
      \ fall in it's no problem, it's just annoying; in that event go back through\
      \ the tunnel from the water and up a wooden lift that brings you back out at\
      \ the base of the bridge.\n</p><p>At the top of the bridge, follow he continuing\
      \ tunnel as it curves round to the left. Soon you will come out in a large cave\
      \ with a river in the middle, guarded by two patrolling Krall. Kill the Krall,\
      \ then take a look around.\n</p><p>The river leaves the cave via tunnels at\
      \ either end, one of which is barred off. A walkway near the roof of the cave\
      \ traverses its length. If you investigate the river banks here, you can collect\
      \ two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, a box of 10 Flak Shells, and four <a href=\"\
      /Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a>.\n\
      </p><p>There's only one way you can leave this cave; go left from the entrance\
      \ and plunge into the river. Follow the winding tunnel from the main cave, eventually\
      \ coming out in a smaller cave where a waterfall cascades down from above. Go\
      \ through the waterfall and climb out of the water into a small fogged cave\
      \ beyond. This small alcove cave contains a human corpse, a lever, two boxes\
      \ of 8 Rifle Rounds and a powerful <a href=\"/Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Rifle\">Rifle</a> weapon (great for decapitations&#160;:) . Collect\
      \ this excellent gear then read the corpse's log [1].\n</p><p>Press the lever\
      \ once - it opens the bars on the other end of the waterway in the main cave\
      \ - and go back along to the river tunnel to the main cave. Beware as you enter\
      \ the main cave the two <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjTroopers</a> with <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"\
      Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistols</a> who have appeared in the cave.\n\
      </p><p>Kill the Skaarj, then follow the river through the now open tunnel at\
      \ the far end. After further winding, you will reach a tall cave with wooden\
      \ support posts and a balcony. Kill the two <a href=\"/Tentacle\" title=\"Tentacle\"\
      >Tentacles</a> who snipe from the roof here, then climb out. The waterway does\
      \ carry on beyond this cave but if you follow it you get caught in the current\
      \ and swept out off the edge of the rock. Not something you want.\n</p><p>Two\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit in this cave are useful health, plus containers revealing\
      \ a Clip and two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards are a useful ammo boost. If\
      \ you double back on the main river bank you follow a short tunnel which leads\
      \ to a lift to the balcony above. Ride the lift and kill the Krall waiting at\
      \ the top.\n</p><p>Follow the balcony and enter the next tunnel at the far end.\
      \ It doubles back again and heads down a slope to a Krall guard at the bottom,\
      \ whereupon it goes off to the left and leads out through the side of the rock\
      \ on to a wooden walkway that acts as a balcony along the length of the rock\
      \ here past a waterfall.\n</p><p>This walkway is patrolled by a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjInfantry</a> with a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"\
      Stinger\">Stinger</a>. I like to decapitate him with the Rifle, though of course\
      \ how you do it is entirely up to you. Anyway, when he is dead, collect of the\
      \ two boxes of 10 Flak Shells up at this end of the walkway, then start to walk\
      \ along its length.\n</p><p>As you descend ramps towards the waterfall you can\
      \ collect the SkaarjInfantry's Stinger and a Health Pack. Opposite the waterfall\
      \ at the bottom you can pick up two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, then another\
      \ Health Pack as you climb the ramps up again beyond the waterfall. At the very\
      \ far end, you can collect two Clips from near another tunnel entrance in the\
      \ side of the rock.\nEnter the tunnel and go up a few slopes until you meet\
      \ another Krall. Continue along the tunnel and kill the next Krall as you go\
      \ round the next corner. A few ramps later, you'll meet one more Krall asleep\
      \ at its post. Dispose of that too. Eventually, you will arrive on the wooden\
      \ bridge above the main cave.\n</p><p>The bridge goes along beneath holes in\
      \ the cave roof where the sky can be seen. At the far end, a tunnel curves round\
      \ to a door guarded by two beefy <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjOfficers</a> with <a href=\"/Ripper\" title=\"\
      Ripper\">Razorjacks</a>. Kill them quickly as it's two against one. When they\
      \ are dead, you can collect of the assortment of items they drop between them;\
      \ two Razorjacks, a box of 50 Razor Blades, and a Rifle.\n</p><p>Go through\
      \ the door they were guarding and into a pleasantly decorated corridor with\
      \ a polished shiny floor. Turn left at this T-junction and follow the curve\
      \ of the corridor round to the end; here a dead end with a transparent window\
      \ and a Health Pack is guarded by a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a>. Kill the Skaarj, then go back\
      \ round past the now locked corridor entrance and to the far end, the other\
      \ side of the transparent window, where a door opens to reveal a flight of stairs\
      \ leading upwards guarded by another SkaarjWarrior. Kill the Skaarj here then\
      \ explore the area at the foot of the stairs. Crates here can be shot open to\
      \ get 40 Tarydium Shards, and there's a Health Pack under the stairs.\n</p><p>Climb\
      \ the stairs, collecting two boxes of 10 Flak Shells, two Clips and a Health\
      \ Pack along the way. At the top of the stairs a door slides open revealing\
      \ a corridor beyond. Step round into the corridor to exit the level.\n</p>\n\

      \ is the twentieth map in [[Unreal|Unreal's]] single player game.\n; Author\
      \ : [[Jeremy War]]\n; Description\n: The player escapes the [[The Sunspire|Sunspire]]\
      \ into the most unlikely of places: a giantic rock suspended in the sky by some\
      \ unknown force. The rock is riddled with caves, and it is these underground\
      \ ways that the player must explore first. Within the caves, a waterfall from\
      \ some unknown source cascades down into the sky below.\n; Note\n: The title\
      \ of this map, and the map that follows it, suggests that the name \"[[Na Pali]]\"\
      \ was originally only intended to be attributed to this sky island. However,\
      \ \"Na Pali\" has since entered canon as the name of the planet itself, with\
      \ the release of the mission pack [[Unreal - Return to Na Pali]] putting the\
      \ final nail into the coffin of fan theories to the contrary.\n{{clear}}\n==Weapons\

      \ on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty\
      \ settings.''\n\nThe Sunspire is just a memory now... your passage in the SkyElevator\
      \ has brought you to a series of beautiful caves beneath the [[Na Pali Haven]],\
      \ a town on a rock that floats serenely in the sky. Time to move on... you can't\
      \ stay here, however beautiful the scenery.\n\nYou start in the SkyElevator.\
      \ Walk to the elevator door, and it opens slowly to reveal a cave; beneath you\
      \ is a hole to sky below, which you can cross once a wooden bridge which comes\
      \ across from solid ground within the cave has finished its movement. Crossing\
      \ the bridge, you will be on a ring of solid ground within the cave around the\
      \ hole in the centre, with a tunnel entrance directly ahead.\n\nBefore taking\
      \ the tunnel entrance, walk round the ring to collect two [[Flare|Flares]] and\
      \ to raid barrels for a Clip and a Health Pack. When you're done, go into the\
      \ tunnel entrance.\n\nThe tunnel climbs a slope then curves round to the right\
      \ into a straight flat section that leads out to the edge of the Na Pali rock,\
      \ where a wooden platform is a viewing balcony over the sky below. A [[Nali]]\
      \ stands on a plank here, watched over by a pair of [[Krall]] guards. As you\
      \ approach, one of the Krall will try to knock the Nali out into space. You\
      \ can stop him, but then the Nali is afraid and jumps off anyway, so there's\
      \ nothing you can do for him.\n\nKill the Krall guards using your [[Enforcer|Automag]].\
      \ They're not that tough, easy enemies as long as you avoid their weapons. Go\
      \ out on to the viewing balcony when the Krall are dead, and go to either side\
      \ there to collect two Clips and a [[Flashlight]].\n\nReturn to the main tunnel\
      \ and go along until you see a heavy metal door on the right. The door opens\
      \ as you approach, so go up the tunnel beyond. Climb the slope. As you turn\
      \ the corner at the top into an area where a rickety plank bridge crosses a\
      \ pool, a Krall will see you and attempt to run away for support. Take him down\
      \ before he can.\n\nTwo barrels at the base of the bridge reveal a pair of ASMD\
      \ Cores. When you have collected the Cores, try to climb the bridge - go via\
      \ the longitudinal support struts, because the cross planks are weak and can\
      \ easily break, chucking you into the water below. If you do fall in it's no\
      \ problem, it's just annoying; in that event go back through the tunnel from\
      \ the water and up a wooden lift that brings you back out at the base of the\
      \ bridge.\n\nAt the top of the bridge, follow he continuing tunnel as it curves\
      \ round to the left. Soon you will come out in a large cave with a river in\
      \ the middle, guarded by two patrolling Krall. Kill the Krall, then take a look\
      \ around.\n\nThe river leaves the cave via tunnels at either end, one of which\
      \ is barred off. A walkway near the roof of the cave traverses its length. If\
      \ you investigate the river banks here, you can collect two clusters of 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards, a box of 10 Flak Shells, and four [[Nali Healing Fruit]].\n\nThere's\
      \ only one way you can leave this cave; go left from the entrance and plunge\
      \ into the river. Follow the winding tunnel from the main cave, eventually coming\
      \ out in a smaller cave where a waterfall cascades down from above. Go through\
      \ the waterfall and climb out of the water into a small fogged cave beyond.\
      \ This small alcove cave contains a human corpse, a lever, two boxes of 8 Rifle\
      \ Rounds and a powerful [[Rifle]] weapon (great for decapitations :) . Collect\
      \ this excellent gear then read the corpse's log [1].\n\nPress the lever once\
      \ - it opens the bars on the other end of the waterway in the main cave - and\
      \ go back along to the river tunnel to the main cave. Beware as you enter the\
      \ main cave the two [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper|SkaarjTroopers]] with [[Dispersion\
      \ Pistol|Dispersion Pistols]] who have appeared in the cave.\n\nKill the Skaarj,\
      \ then follow the river through the now open tunnel at the far end. After further\
      \ winding, you will reach a tall cave with wooden support posts and a balcony.\
      \ Kill the two [[Tentacle|Tentacles]] who snipe from the roof here, then climb\
      \ out. The waterway does carry on beyond this cave but if you follow it you\
      \ get caught in the current and swept out off the edge of the rock. Not something\
      \ you want.\n\nTwo Nali Healing Fruit in this cave are useful health, plus containers\
      \ revealing a Clip and two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards are a useful ammo\
      \ boost. If you double back on the main river bank you follow a short tunnel\
      \ which leads to a lift to the balcony above. Ride the lift and kill the Krall\
      \ waiting at the top.\n\nFollow the balcony and enter the next tunnel at the\
      \ far end. It doubles back again and heads down a slope to a Krall guard at\
      \ the bottom, whereupon it goes off to the left and leads out through the side\
      \ of the rock on to a wooden walkway that acts as a balcony along the length\
      \ of the rock here past a waterfall.\n\nThis walkway is patrolled by a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry|SkaarjInfantry]]\
      \ with a [[Stinger]]. I like to decapitate him with the Rifle, though of course\
      \ how you do it is entirely up to you. Anyway, when he is dead, collect of the\
      \ two boxes of 10 Flak Shells up at this end of the walkway, then start to walk\
      \ along its length.\n\nAs you descend ramps towards the waterfall you can collect\
      \ the SkaarjInfantry's Stinger and a Health Pack. Opposite the waterfall at\
      \ the bottom you can pick up two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, then another\
      \ Health Pack as you climb the ramps up again beyond the waterfall. At the very\
      \ far end, you can collect two Clips from near another tunnel entrance in the\
      \ side of the rock.\nEnter the tunnel and go up a few slopes until you meet\
      \ another Krall. Continue along the tunnel and kill the next Krall as you go\
      \ round the next corner. A few ramps later, you'll meet one more Krall asleep\
      \ at its post. Dispose of that too. Eventually, you will arrive on the wooden\
      \ bridge above the main cave.\n\nThe bridge goes along beneath holes in the\
      \ cave roof where the sky can be seen. At the far end, a tunnel curves round\
      \ to a door guarded by two beefy [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer|SkaarjOfficers]]\
      \ with [[Ripper|Razorjacks]]. Kill them quickly as it's two against one. When\
      \ they are dead, you can collect of the assortment of items they drop between\
      \ them; two Razorjacks, a box of 50 Razor Blades, and a Rifle.\n\nGo through\
      \ the door they were guarding and into a pleasantly decorated corridor with\
      \ a polished shiny floor. Turn left at this T-junction and follow the curve\
      \ of the corridor round to the end; here a dead end with a transparent window\
      \ and a Health Pack is guarded by a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]].\
      \ Kill the Skaarj, then go back round past the now locked corridor entrance\
      \ and to the far end, the other side of the transparent window, where a door\
      \ opens to reveal a flight of stairs leading upwards guarded by another SkaarjWarrior.\
      \ Kill the Skaarj here then explore the area at the foot of the stairs. Crates\
      \ here can be shot open to get 40 Tarydium Shards, and there's a Health Pack\
      \ under the stairs.\n\nClimb the stairs, collecting two boxes of 10 Flak Shells,\
      \ two Clips and a Health Pack along the way. At the top of the stairs a door\
      \ slides open revealing a corridor beyond. Step round into the corridor to exit\
      \ the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"I'm the only one left. I've managed\
