      \ the Bonus Pack 1 and 4 Readme files:</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Xan Mark II - After\
      \ his defeat in the Tournament, Xan has been rebuilt from the ground up. He's\
      \ stronger, faster, and a hell of a lot meaner looking.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>WarBoss\
      \ - Liandri researchers have been experimenting with recently uncovered Skaarj\
      \ technology and have been implementing their results in a  new model. Dubbed\
      \ \"Warboss,\" he's the fastest and most agile robot ever produced.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd>Nali - The Nali race has been long enslaved and dominated by the Skaarj.\
      \ A newly formed Nali faction has repented their pacifist ways and has rebelled\
      \ against the Skaarj, and they’re ready to prove their combat skills in the\
      \ Tournament.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>Nali WarCow - When the militant Nali were driven\
      \ from their homeworld they brought the only domesticated beast they knew of\
      \ - their local livestock. By using Pavlovian techniques and heavy cerebral\
      \ modification they are training their cattle to fight instead of graze.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd>So there you go. Warboss, while not Corrupt, is a Liandri robot, the\
      \ Nali are basically a rebel faction (But are unnamed, note), and the Warcows\
      \ basically got trained to fight by those. Cool stuff. --<a href=\"/User:Dark_Pulse\"\

      <dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks, I didn't get around to look that up yet. So do you think\
      \ we should add the whole bunch to one article, or give every character its\
      \ own? I say \"character\" because Xan isn't really a team, although he did\
      \ come with 2 skins I believe. Same for WarBoss. Only the Nali and and Cows\
      \ are referred to as a team. It's probably best to get some opinions before\
