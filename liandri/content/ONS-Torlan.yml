      \ map is mostly symmetrical, however, as usual, the terrain is slightly different\
      \ on each side. Furthermore, the red team (assuming it's the first round in\
      \ the match, as teams in ONS will switch bases with each round) can fire at\
      \ the Raptor's spawn point (and damage said Raptor if it belongs to the enemy)\
      \ at the central node by using the energy turret located on the outer wall near\
      \ their own Raptor at their base. For the next round (if there is any), this\
      \ small advantage will be available to the blue team, and so on until the match\
      \ ends.\n</p><p>The bases are built exactly the same. There is a tall tower\
      \ in the center of the map which is useful for sniping, as well as using the\
      \ hills for cover from tank shells and to take shots at people at the nodes\
      \ below.\n</p><p>ONS-Torlan is currently the most popular <a href=\"/Onslaught\"\
      \ title=\"Onslaught\">Onslaught</a> map. The inclusion of this map in the demo\
      \ version added to the popularity of the level. It is also often considered\
      \ to be the ideal, though overplayed, Onslaught map. There have been a lot of\
      \ remakes of this map, including the official UT3 <a href=\"/WAR-Torlan\" title=\"\
      WAR-Torlan\">WAR-Torlan</a>. The second UT2004 demo Onslaught map, <a href=\"\
      /ONS-Primeval\" title=\"ONS-Primeval\">ONS-Primeval</a>, was never nearly as\
      \ popular due to the lack of space, choke points and late inclusion in the demo.\n\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Strategies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt> Offensive</dt>\n<dd> When playing the default\
      \ link setup, the usual strategy involves taking the <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"\
      Manta\">Manta</a> with people riding on its wings (the more people, the better\
      \ and faster your nodes build up) to the first node available (2 or 4 depending\
      \ on your team), while having another person drive the <a href=\"/Hellbender\"\
      \ title=\"Hellbender\">Hellbender</a> (preferably with more passengers on it\
      \ too) to the center node (the Hellbender's turrets should help your team to\
      \ control and secure the area near the center node, unless the opposite team\
      \ does the same, which will be an even battle). While all this is being done,\
      \ have yet another person fly the <a href=\"/Raptor\" title=\"Raptor\">Raptor</a>\
      \ to the top of the central communications tower to grab the <a href=\"/Redeemer\"\
      \ title=\"Redeemer\">Redeemer</a> as soon as it spawns; be warned that the opposite\
      \ team will usually try the same, which more often than not results in a Raptor\
      \ dogfight around the tower. Should this happen, try to back up your teammate\
      \ flying the Raptor with <a href=\"/AVRiL\" title=\"AVRiL\">AVRiL</a>, <a href=\"\
      /Shock_Rifle\" title=\"Shock Rifle\">Shock Rifle</a> or Energy Turret fire.\
      \ Slightly before the first node is totally built, have the first Manta driver\
      \ go to the corner node to build it as soon as possible, and when the node is\
      \ built already, the person or people carried on the Manta's wings should take\
      \ the Manta spawning at the node and drive it to the corner node as well, to\
      \ help build that node as fast as possible and bring that <a href=\"/Goliath\"\
      \ title=\"Goliath\">Goliath</a> towards the center node as soon as possible.\
      \ Your <a href=\"/Scorpion\" title=\"Scorpion\">Scorpion</a> should stay at\
      \ home; you will find it useful in defense against enemy Mantas.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> This should leave your team in sort of a statu-quo position - possesion\
      \ of the first and corner nodes, while the center node is usually under attack.\
      \ The battle for the center node will be bloody, which is why carrying your\
      \ more powerful vehicles, the Hellbender first, and later the Goliath, towards\
      \ that point helps. At this time, attacking the opposite team's corner node\
      \ with your Mantas is just as essential as trying to conquer the center node,\
      \ since it gives your opposition two points to defend and worry about. Also,\
      \ a successful Redeemer attack over a key enemy node is more often than not\
      \ the turning point in the game.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Another (odd and risky)\
      \ tactic at the beggining of the game is to have the Manta rush quickly at the\
      \ opposite team's first node (while the rest of your team tries to build your\
      \ nodes up), trying to kill the enemy team, while they are building their node;\
      \ if you are successful at killing all of them (finish your job by laying spider\
      \ mines at their first node's spawn point) as soon as possible, you'll manage\
      \ to hamper the opposition's ability to build their nodes quite a lot. However\
      \ this strategy can be countered by people on foot firing AVRiLs beforehand\
      \ and locking them onto you as soon as you appear, and an alert Raptor pilot.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> When playing the split-square link setup (rarely played), have the\
      \ Manta fly towards the first node and the Raptor fly towards the opposite corner\
      \ node to get both nodes as soon as possible. On that corner node, take the\
      \ Goliath available and start hammering the enemy team's first node as soon\
      \ as possible, while on your first node try to take the enemy's Goliath down.\
      \ Proper Goliath attacks are the key here, more so than in the default link\
      \ setup. Don't expect a statu-quo situation as in the default link setup, but\
      \ rather a race to see which team destroys the opposite Power Core first.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt> Defensive</dt>\n<dd> The best defensive techniques on this map are\
      \ to use the <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"Turrets\">Energy\
      \ Turrets</a> well. It is easier to stave off vehicles that are attacking nodes\
      \ with a turret than any of your pea-shooter weapons. Your Scorpions will also\
      \ be key in defense of your nodes against enemy Mantas.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\
      \ Another important thing is to keep an <a href=\"/AVRiL\" title=\"AVRiL\">AVRiL</a>\
      \ in your inventory at all times.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Once your team owns the\
      \ center node, you can use the Hellbender spawning in the bridge above that\
      \ node to attack the enemy team's first node (or rather defend it if it belongs\
      \ to your team). Try to take advantage of the cover that the center tower's\
      \ bridge pillars at the base provide you - try to put the Hellbender in such\
      \ a position so that you can freely fire from its rear turret (through the pillars)\
      \ at the first node area, while you remain \"hidden\" behind the pillars. Enemy\
      \ players will have a much harder time trying to get you down; they won't be\
      \ able to lock AVRiL missiles on you from their node, they can only snipe you\
      \ back or rather deal directly with your Hellbender on the bridge (at this point\
      \ you can still defend yourself with the Hellbender's side turret).</dd></dl>\n\

      | title       = Torlan\n| description = Set on the dried outskirts of a lush\
      \ jungle continent, two factions clash in fierce combat for control of a major\
      \ communications tower and its adjacent power supply. With the dam holding back\
      \ the waters from the nearby jungle, the dried out riverbed running across the\
      \ battlefield allows for an easy attack route into enemy territory and could\
      \ provide a decisive victor with ownership of the enormous Comm-tower as the\
      \ reward.\n| mapimage    = ONS-Torlan.gif\n| author      = [[Streamline Studios]],\

      \ is mostly symmetrical, however, as usual, the terrain is slightly different\
      \ on each side. Furthermore, the red team (assuming it's the first round in\
      \ the match, as teams in ONS will switch bases with each round) can fire at\
      \ the Raptor's spawn point (and damage said Raptor if it belongs to the enemy)\
      \ at the central node by using the energy turret located on the outer wall near\
      \ their own Raptor at their base. For the next round (if there is any), this\
      \ small advantage will be available to the blue team, and so on until the match\
      \ ends.\n\nThe bases are built exactly the same. There is a tall tower in the\
      \ center of the map which is useful for sniping, as well as using the hills\
      \ for cover from tank shells and to take shots at people at the nodes below.\n\
      \nONS-Torlan is currently the most popular [[Onslaught]] map. The inclusion\
      \ of this map in the demo version added to the popularity of the level. It is\
      \ also often considered to be the ideal, though overplayed, Onslaught map. There\
      \ have been a lot of remakes of this map, including the official UT3 [[WAR-Torlan]].\
      \ The second UT2004 demo Onslaught map, [[ONS-Primeval]], was never nearly as\
      \ popular due to the lack of space, choke points and late inclusion in the demo.\n\

      \n==Strategies==\n; Offensive\n: When playing the default link setup, the usual\
      \ strategy involves taking the [[Manta]] with people riding on its wings (the\
      \ more people, the better and faster your nodes build up) to the first node\
      \ available (2 or 4 depending on your team), while having another person drive\
      \ the [[Hellbender]] (preferably with more passengers on it too) to the center\
      \ node (the Hellbender's turrets should help your team to control and secure\
      \ the area near the center node, unless the opposite team does the same, which\
      \ will be an even battle). While all this is being done, have yet another person\
      \ fly the [[Raptor]] to the top of the central communications tower to grab\
      \ the [[Redeemer]] as soon as it spawns; be warned that the opposite team will\
      \ usually try the same, which more often than not results in a Raptor dogfight\
      \ around the tower. Should this happen, try to back up your teammate flying\
      \ the Raptor with [[AVRiL]], [[Shock Rifle]] or Energy Turret fire. Slightly\
      \ before the first node is totally built, have the first Manta driver go to\
      \ the corner node to build it as soon as possible, and when the node is built\
      \ already, the person or people carried on the Manta's wings should take the\
      \ Manta spawning at the node and drive it to the corner node as well, to help\
      \ build that node as fast as possible and bring that [[Goliath]] towards the\
      \ center node as soon as possible. Your [[Scorpion]] should stay at home; you\
      \ will find it useful in defense against enemy Mantas.\n\n: This should leave\
      \ your team in sort of a statu-quo position - possesion of the first and corner\
      \ nodes, while the center node is usually under attack. The battle for the center\
      \ node will be bloody, which is why carrying your more powerful vehicles, the\
      \ Hellbender first, and later the Goliath, towards that point helps. At this\
      \ time, attacking the opposite team's corner node with your Mantas is just as\
      \ essential as trying to conquer the center node, since it gives your opposition\
      \ two points to defend and worry about. Also, a successful Redeemer attack over\
      \ a key enemy node is more often than not the turning point in the game.\n\n\
      : Another (odd and risky) tactic at the beggining of the game is to have the\
      \ Manta rush quickly at the opposite team's first node (while the rest of your\
      \ team tries to build your nodes up), trying to kill the enemy team, while they\
      \ are building their node; if you are successful at killing all of them (finish\
      \ your job by laying spider mines at their first node's spawn point) as soon\
      \ as possible, you'll manage to hamper the opposition's ability to build their\
      \ nodes quite a lot. However this strategy can be countered by people on foot\
      \ firing AVRiLs beforehand and locking them onto you as soon as you appear,\
      \ and an alert Raptor pilot.\n\n: When playing the split-square link setup (rarely\
      \ played), have the Manta fly towards the first node and the Raptor fly towards\
      \ the opposite corner node to get both nodes as soon as possible. On that corner\
      \ node, take the Goliath available and start hammering the enemy team's first\
      \ node as soon as possible, while on your first node try to take the enemy's\
      \ Goliath down. Proper Goliath attacks are the key here, more so than in the\
      \ default link setup. Don't expect a statu-quo situation as in the default link\
      \ setup, but rather a race to see which team destroys the opposite Power Core\
      \ first.\n\n; Defensive\n: The best defensive techniques on this map are to\
      \ use the [[Turrets#Unreal Tournament 2004|Energy Turrets]] well. It is easier\
      \ to stave off vehicles that are attacking nodes with a turret than any of your\
      \ pea-shooter weapons. Your Scorpions will also be key in defense of your nodes\
      \ against enemy Mantas.\n\n: Another important thing is to keep an [[AVRiL]]\
      \ in your inventory at all times.\n\n: Once your team owns the center node,\
      \ you can use the Hellbender spawning in the bridge above that node to attack\
      \ the enemy team's first node (or rather defend it if it belongs to your team).\
      \ Try to take advantage of the cover that the center tower's bridge pillars\
      \ at the base provide you - try to put the Hellbender in such a position so\
      \ that you can freely fire from its rear turret (through the pillars) at the\
      \ first node area, while you remain \"hidden\" behind the pillars. Enemy players\
      \ will have a much harder time trying to get you down; they won't be able to\
      \ lock AVRiL missiles on you from their node, they can only snipe you back or\
      \ rather deal directly with your Hellbender on the bridge (at this point you\
      \ can still defend yourself with the Hellbender's side turret)."
