      \ that this map features dense fog and heavy snowfall. What's more surprising,\
      \ is that it results in a rather cramped Bombing Run arena as well. The Ice\
      \ Fields' rocky cliffs give shape to narrow canyons (for BR standards), and\
      \ passing through them can be quite a task. There are a few shortcuts that can\
      \ be used, as well as plenty of ledges, which add a bit of a Z-Axis to the map's\
      \ gameplay. The Bomb spawns in the center region of the map, on a clearing.\
      \ The teams must then pass through a series of canyons to reach the other team's\
      \ base (which are both on open fields as well). The Goals are on the top floors\
      \ of the bases and can be reached via an elevator. There is no terminal consequence\
      \ for jumping through the goal in this map.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ possibly why the name in the SP Intro was \"Kalendra Ice Fields\" as this\
      \ beta was only 3 1/2 months before UT2003 was released. The map filename was\
      \ retained for <a href=\"/Unreal_Championship\" title=\"Unreal Championship\"\
      >Unreal Championship</a>.</li>\n<li> In the betas, this was the only map which\
      \ allowed the use of vehicles, due to its size.</li>\n<li> Speaking of <a href=\"\
      /Unreal_Championship\" title=\"Unreal Championship\">Unreal Championship</a>,\
      \ it turns out that the introductory text was much, much longer:</li></ul>\n\
      <blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">Humans as a group tend to exhibit\
      \ strong parasitic tendencies, draining each planet of resources before moving\
      \ to another. This disposable society contributes to the high rate of industrial\
      \ decay on many colonial planets as factories are simply abandoned, and mines\
      \ are left to leech poison into the landscape.<br /><br />Contemplation of the\
      \ moral implications of these practices is best left to philosophers, most of\
      \ which were used for target practice during arena training. The League needs\
      \ no moral high ground to stand on. What can be used, will be used.<br /><br\
      \ />Take, for example, the ice mining facilities of Alleria. The plasteel alloy\
      \ used in the manufacture of mineral extraction processors is inexpensive and\
      \ relatively disposable, while the iridium and other minerals hidden below the\
      \ ice are not. Once an area has been stripped out of resources, it is often\
      \ easier to simply abandon the mine and construct another elsewhere than dig\
      \ the existing structure out of the ice.<br /><br />Taking its name from the\
      \ ice fields on which it was built, the Kalendra Iridium Storage Facility was\
      \ designed with the purpose of protecting the valuable resources contained within\
      \ its massive bunkers. Previous to Imperial rule the sector was known for violent\
      \ raids by transport hijackers who felt that stealing the ore was much more\
      \ preferable to digging it out of the ground.<br /><br />The bunkers were built\
      \ with raider attacks in mind. Facing each other across the valley floor, each\
      \ structure was able to provide the other with cover fire and ground support\
      \ in the event of an attack. This defensive strategy required attackers to divide\
      \ their forces between both bunkers, weakening their position significantly.\
      \ Now it provides the Tournaments with an excellent team-based arena competition\
      \ that always ends with a bang.<br /><br />A quick survey of the area offers\
      \ a glimpse of hard snowpack spread deeply across the rocky surface, with steep\
      \ ridged that form narrow trenches across the ice field. Bridging the trenches\
      \ are several light-alloy trestles, allowing foot soldiers to move between locations\
      \ without having to scale the slick ice of the trench walls. Before taking part\
      \ in a competitive Bombing Run match, competitors should run through the Virtual\
      \ Tournament Simulator to get a feel for the arena.<br /><br />For those with\
      \ an aversion to exercise, vehicles can be found in the rear hangar bays of\
      \ the binkers, allowing combatants to rush the enemy with greater speed. The\
      \ steep inclination of the terrain bracketing the lowlands limits wheeled vehicles\
      \ to the trenches, so be aware that while you may be faster the enemy will have\
      \ the advantage of greater elevation.<br /><br />Once a competitor enters the\
      \ enemy stronghold, they will have to make their way to the demolition target\
      \ area, and plant the detonator. The odds will not be in their favor. Bets may\
      \ be placed at the local League Recruitment Center, but take note of this friendly\
      \ reminder, don't sign anything.</blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right;\

      \ as [[Unreal Championship]]'s BR-Kalendra. \n\n==Map Description==\nInspired\
      \ by the Canadian weather, it is no surprise that this map features dense fog\
      \ and heavy snowfall. What's more surprising, is that it results in a rather\
      \ cramped Bombing Run arena as well. The Ice Fields' rocky cliffs give shape\
      \ to narrow canyons (for BR standards), and passing through them can be quite\
      \ a task. There are a few shortcuts that can be used, as well as plenty of ledges,\
      \ which add a bit of a Z-Axis to the map's gameplay. The Bomb spawns in the\
      \ center region of the map, on a clearing. The teams must then pass through\
      \ a series of canyons to reach the other team's base (which are both on open\
      \ fields as well). The Goals are on the top floors of the bases and can be reached\
      \ via an elevator. There is no terminal consequence for jumping through the\
      \ goal in this map.\n\n==Weapons & Pickups==\n[[Image:BR-IceFields-Pickups.png|thumb|275px|right|Ice\

      \ tricks==\n* Because of the many narrow passages, it is hard for just 1 carrier\
      \ to make it to the other team's base. Always have a teammate nearby to enable\
      \ the use of the shortcuts.\n* Make sure to move the bomb around as much as\
      \ possible. Pass to teammates regularly, or even to an opponent (who is then\
      \ suddenly unable to fire his weapon, making him a sitting duck for a brief\
      \ moment). Also, the \"Translocate behind the opponent and pass the ball\" maneuver\
      \ works very well in this map.\n* Then there's the last stretch to the opponent's\
      \ base. Luckily, the goal is out in the open, and the carrier could theoretically\
      \ score from as far as the other end of the clearing. This, however, requires\
      \ a lot of practice, a bit of luck and a boost from the [[Shock Rifle]]'s primary\
      \ fire.\n\n=== Single-Player tips ===\n\n{{Prevnext|BR-TwinTombs|BR-Skyline|UT2004\

      \ levelshot of BR-Kalendra.]]\n* In the UT2003 SP intro, \"Kalendra Ice Fields\"\
      \ is the arena that Malcolm's and Gorge's teams must fight in.\n* According\
      \ to the author (Dave Ewing), this map was inspired by \"a typical drive into\
      \ work\" ([http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/u/unrealchampionship/Chat-UnrealChampionship.htm\
      \ source]).\n* The name for this map in the [[UT2003]] 926 Beta was BR-Kalendra.\
      \ This is possibly why the name in the SP Intro was \"Kalendra Ice Fields\"\
      \ as this beta was only 3 1/2 months before UT2003 was released. The map filename\
      \ was retained for [[Unreal Championship]].\n* In the betas, this was the only\
      \ map which allowed the use of vehicles, due to its size.\n* Speaking of [[Unreal\
      \ Championship]], it turns out that the introductory text was much, much longer:\n\
      {{QuoteSource|Humans as a group tend to exhibit strong parasitic tendencies,\
      \ draining each planet of resources before moving to another. This disposable\
      \ society contributes to the high rate of industrial decay on many colonial\
      \ planets as factories are simply abandoned, and mines are left to leech poison\
      \ into the landscape.<br><br>Contemplation of the moral implications of these\
      \ practices is best left to philosophers, most of which were used for target\
      \ practice during arena training. The League needs no moral high ground to stand\
      \ on. What can be used, will be used.<br><br>Take, for example, the ice mining\
      \ facilities of Alleria. The plasteel alloy used in the manufacture of mineral\
      \ extraction processors is inexpensive and relatively disposable, while the\
      \ iridium and other minerals hidden below the ice are not. Once an area has\
      \ been stripped out of resources, it is often easier to simply abandon the mine\
      \ and construct another elsewhere than dig the existing structure out of the\
      \ ice.<br><br>Taking its name from the ice fields on which it was built, the\
      \ Kalendra Iridium Storage Facility was designed with the purpose of protecting\
      \ the valuable resources contained within its massive bunkers. Previous to Imperial\
      \ rule the sector was known for violent raids by transport hijackers who felt\
      \ that stealing the ore was much more preferable to digging it out of the ground.<br><br>The\
      \ bunkers were built with raider attacks in mind. Facing each other across the\
      \ valley floor, each structure was able to provide the other with cover fire\
      \ and ground support in the event of an attack. This defensive strategy required\
      \ attackers to divide their forces between both bunkers, weakening their position\
      \ significantly. Now it provides the Tournaments with an excellent team-based\
      \ arena competition that always ends with a bang.<br><br>A quick survey of the\
      \ area offers a glimpse of hard snowpack spread deeply across the rocky surface,\
      \ with steep ridged that form narrow trenches across the ice field. Bridging\
      \ the trenches are several light-alloy trestles, allowing foot soldiers to move\
      \ between locations without having to scale the slick ice of the trench walls.\
      \ Before taking part in a competitive Bombing Run match, competitors should\
      \ run through the Virtual Tournament Simulator to get a feel for the arena.<br><br>For\
      \ those with an aversion to exercise, vehicles can be found in the rear hangar\
      \ bays of the binkers, allowing combatants to rush the enemy with greater speed.\
      \ The steep inclination of the terrain bracketing the lowlands limits wheeled\
      \ vehicles to the trenches, so be aware that while you may be faster the enemy\
      \ will have the advantage of greater elevation.<br><br>Once a competitor enters\
      \ the enemy stronghold, they will have to make their way to the demolition target\
      \ area, and plant the detonator. The odds will not be in their favor. Bets may\
