      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Dark Arena was, by all accounts, a pretty horrific\
      \ experience. Now, still shaken from the battle with the <a href=\"/Titan\"\
      \ title=\"Titan\">Titan</a>, you emerge into the evening sunlit peace of the\
      \ Nali settlement of Harobed Village. But things never stay quiet for long on\
      \ this planet; and a short way down the canyon, a huge alien structure dominates\
      \ the natural cliffs.\n</p><p>You start in the exit tunnel from the Dark Arena.\
      \ Following the corridor round, you enter an open field. A canyon leading to\
      \ a huge alien structure heads off to the right, whilst a small cluster of huts\
      \ rests on the left. Head for the houses, but first if you need to, collect\
      \ the Nali Healing Fruit growing beside the doorway.\n</p><p>Go to the village\
      \ gates; there is another Nali Healing Fruit here, plus a Nali Rabbit which\
      \ hops off towards a hut ahead. Follow it and enter the modest home, killing\
      \ the <a href=\"/Fly\" title=\"Fly\">Fly</a> that ambushes you as you enter.\
      \ The fire is lit but no-one is home, so collect the <a href=\"/Flashlight\"\
      \ title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a> from the table then destroy the two barrels\
      \ and the vase to retrieve Bandages, a Health Pack and an <a href=\"/Eightball_Gun\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eightball Gun\">Eightball Gun</a>. Climb the\
      \ ladder into the loft (it's dark and you'll need to toss a <a href=\"/Flare\"\
      \ title=\"Flare\">Flare</a>) to collect a Clip and read a diary [1].\n</p><p>Leave\
      \ the house now. Watch out for the Flies that have appeared outside, then circumnavigate\
      \ the walls of the house to get two Nali Healing Fruits.\n</p><p>Enter the second\
      \ house, which is in darkness. Kill the Fly here. There is an <a href=\"/Automag\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a> on the table, and if you\
      \ climb the broken ladder to the loft you can get Tarydium Shards and a single\
      \ Flak Shell (<a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>\
      \ ammo). Leave this house now - kill any more Flies that have appeared - and\
      \ go round the back to procure another Nali Healing Fruit and another Flak Shell.\
      \ Return to the centre of the cluster of houses. There is a well here but with\
      \ no visible way to get inside, so shoot the barrel nearby to collect Tarydium\
      \ Shards then go into the third house (the one with smoke coming out of the\
      \ chimney). A Nali inside prays by his fire. Read his diary on the table [2].\n\
      </p><p>Sounds like there's a useful gun around here somewhere... anyway, raid\
      \ the hut; barrels contain Eightballs and a Flare, and there is a Health Pack\
      \ by the fire. In the loft is an ASMD Core. Return once more to the great outdoors.\n\
      </p><p>Round the back of the third hut is a Nali Healing Fruit. Collect it if\
      \ you need to, then enter the final hut. The hut is dark and in disrepair; collect\
      \ the Flare and the Eightballs here then leave the house. When you have visited\
      \ all of the houses, take a walk up the hill. You will see the abbey mentioned\
      \ in the Nali's diary ahead, with a wooden gateway providing an access point\
      \ in the stone wall.\n</p><p>Before entering though, head round to the left\
      \ of the stone wall and up to the cliff at the top of the slope to get two Clips\
      \ and a Nali Healing Fruit. Return to the gateway.\n</p><p>Enter the abbey yard.\
      \ You should see a SkaarjWarrior patrolling the roof; kill it with the <a href=\"\
      /ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a>. Now, go up to the abbey\
      \ entrance and wait; when another SkaarjWarrior coms out, kill that too. Don't\
      \ go inside yet though, instead, head for the other end of the building's walls\
      \ and go through an arch there into a small cemetary. There is a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ resting here; dispose of him too. Collect what the cemetary has to offer;\
      \ two Flares, a can of 12 Eightballs, an ASMD Core and several Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit. Then, go to the far end of the graveyard.\n</p><p>Standing at the far\
      \ end and facing the entrance, you will see that the tombstones are arranged\
      \ in two lines. The first tombstone on the left has an outset stone on the back\
      \ with Chizra's face on it. Press it, and the first tomb on the right slides\
      \ open revealing a staircase down. Take the staircase down and you will emerge\
      \ in a cave at the bottom. A <a href=\"/Slith\" title=\"Slith\">Slith</a> in\
      \ a water pool will see you and climb out; kill it. Collect a Flare and Tarydium\
      \ Shards from this area then walk along the stone ledge (don't bother entering\
      \ the water). A vase along the way reveals a Flare, and there is a Health Pack\
      \ where the ledge crosses the water; watch out for the <a href=\"/Tentacle\"\
      \ title=\"Tentacle\">Tentacle</a> on the roof here.\nAs you reach the far end,\
      \ a Tentacle may snipe from a doorway. Kill it then break vases to find three\
      \ valuable Nali Fruit Seeds. Collect these and Tarydium Shards from this side\
      \ of the doorway.\nEnter the doorway and drop into the water beyond. Follow\
      \ the tunnel and you will be at the bottom of a well, where there is a box of\
      \ 50 Bullets, a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Return\
      \ to the cave; you will have to fight a SkaarjWarrior that has appeared here.\
      \ That done, return to the cemetary.\n</p><p>Time now to enter the abbey, so\
      \ go round to the front door. Enter and go down a couple of steps to reach a\
      \ small hallway where barrels reveal a can of 12 Eightballs. Enter the main\
      \ abbey room. A Nali Priest prays here before a statue on the altar; before\
      \ disturbing him, open vases to get a Clip and 2 sets of Bandages. The aisles\
      \ between the pews reveal a Health Pack and, amongst dead Nali, a diary [3].\n\
      </p><p>Go up to the Nali Priest. He will awake from his prayer and lead you\
      \ to the back of the abbey, where he opens a secret door, then he will lead\
      \ you back to the altar and bow at you. Go behind the statue to get an Assault\
      \ Vest. Then, go through the secret door he opened.\n</p><p>Climb some steps\
      \ and hop across a gap to a balcony above the main abbey room. There is a Clip\
      \ and 2 Health Packs on this balcony. Then, follow the walkway round past a\
      \ vase that contains Bandages to a lift in the tower. Ride the lift to the tower\
      \ loft, where there are two boxes of 10 Flak Shells and an excellent <a href=\"\
      /Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a> gun. Grab the gear. You\
      \ are ready to move on now, so leave the abbey. Watch out as you do so, because\
      \ you may be attacked by a SkaarjWarrior as you leave. If you do, then kill\
      \ it.\n</p><p>Leave Harobed Village and set off down the canyon. As you descend\
      \ the canyon towards the huge alien structure, you will pass a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit and two Clips near a human corpse. Collect what you need. As you approach\
      \ a large pool of dirty water beneath the alien installation, you may meet a\
      \ <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"Manta\">Manta</a>. You will also be attacked by\
      \ a SkaarjWarrior - this is a good opportunity to test out your Flak Cannon.\n\
      </p><p>Kill the creatures, collect the Nali Healing Fruit from either corner\
      \ where the land meets the water if you need to, then prepare to cross the bridge.\n\
      </p><p>Cross the bridge as far as you can. Watch out for Flies coming out of\
      \ the water. The bridge is damaged in the middle, so take a dip and use the\
      \ protruding metal girder to get across to the other end of where the bridge\
      \ should be. As you step on to dry land, a SkaarjWarrior will come round the\
      \ corner that you should kill.\n</p><p>Kill the Skaarj and (if you want) shoot\
      \ the explosive Tarydium barrels but don't stand too close. A high-tech entrance\
      \ to the rock face is here, near a strange unfamiliar humanoid corpse. Ignore\
      \ the corpse for now, and collect what you need of the Nali Healing Fruit and\
      \ Eightballs here. Finally, go through the metal doors to exit the level.\n\

      The Dark Arena was, by all accounts, a pretty horrific experience. Now, still\
      \ shaken from the battle with the [[Titan]], you emerge into the evening sunlit\
      \ peace of the Nali settlement of Harobed Village. But things never stay quiet\
      \ for long on this planet; and a short way down the canyon, a huge alien structure\
      \ dominates the natural cliffs.\n\nYou start in the exit tunnel from the Dark\
      \ Arena. Following the corridor round, you enter an open field. A canyon leading\
      \ to a huge alien structure heads off to the right, whilst a small cluster of\
      \ huts rests on the left. Head for the houses, but first if you need to, collect\
      \ the Nali Healing Fruit growing beside the doorway.\n\nGo to the village gates;\
      \ there is another Nali Healing Fruit here, plus a Nali Rabbit which hops off\
      \ towards a hut ahead. Follow it and enter the modest home, killing the [[Fly]]\
      \ that ambushes you as you enter. The fire is lit but no-one is home, so collect\
      \ the [[Flashlight]] from the table then destroy the two barrels and the vase\
      \ to retrieve Bandages, a Health Pack and an [[Eightball Gun]]. Climb the ladder\
      \ into the loft (it's dark and you'll need to toss a [[Flare]]) to collect a\
      \ Clip and read a diary [1].\n\nLeave the house now. Watch out for the Flies\
      \ that have appeared outside, then circumnavigate the walls of the house to\
      \ get two Nali Healing Fruits.\n\nEnter the second house, which is in darkness.\
      \ Kill the Fly here. There is an [[Automag]] on the table, and if you climb\
      \ the broken ladder to the loft you can get Tarydium Shards and a single Flak\
      \ Shell ([[Flak Cannon]] ammo). Leave this house now - kill any more Flies that\
      \ have appeared - and go round the back to procure another Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ and another Flak Shell. Return to the centre of the cluster of houses. There\
      \ is a well here but with no visible way to get inside, so shoot the barrel\
      \ nearby to collect Tarydium Shards then go into the third house (the one with\
      \ smoke coming out of the chimney). A Nali inside prays by his fire. Read his\
      \ diary on the table [2].\n\nSounds like there's a useful gun around here somewhere...\
      \ anyway, raid the hut; barrels contain Eightballs and a Flare, and there is\
      \ a Health Pack by the fire. In the loft is an ASMD Core. Return once more to\
      \ the great outdoors.\n\nRound the back of the third hut is a Nali Healing Fruit.\
      \ Collect it if you need to, then enter the final hut. The hut is dark and in\
      \ disrepair; collect the Flare and the Eightballs here then leave the house.\
      \ When you have visited all of the houses, take a walk up the hill. You will\
      \ see the abbey mentioned in the Nali's diary ahead, with a wooden gateway providing\
      \ an access point in the stone wall.\n\nBefore entering though, head round to\
      \ the left of the stone wall and up to the cliff at the top of the slope to\
      \ get two Clips and a Nali Healing Fruit. Return to the gateway.\n\nEnter the\
      \ abbey yard. You should see a SkaarjWarrior patrolling the roof; kill it with\
      \ the [[ASMD]]. Now, go up to the abbey entrance and wait; when another SkaarjWarrior\
      \ coms out, kill that too. Don't go inside yet though, instead, head for the\
      \ other end of the building's walls and go through an arch there into a small\
      \ cemetary. There is a SkaarjWarrior resting here; dispose of him too. Collect\
      \ what the cemetary has to offer; two Flares, a can of 12 Eightballs, an ASMD\
      \ Core and several Nali Healing Fruit. Then, go to the far end of the graveyard.\n\
      \nStanding at the far end and facing the entrance, you will see that the tombstones\
      \ are arranged in two lines. The first tombstone on the left has an outset stone\
      \ on the back with Chizra's face on it. Press it, and the first tomb on the\
      \ right slides open revealing a staircase down. Take the staircase down and\
      \ you will emerge in a cave at the bottom. A [[Slith]] in a water pool will\
      \ see you and climb out; kill it. Collect a Flare and Tarydium Shards from this\
      \ area then walk along the stone ledge (don't bother entering the water). A\
      \ vase along the way reveals a Flare, and there is a Health Pack where the ledge\
      \ crosses the water; watch out for the [[Tentacle]] on the roof here.\nAs you\
      \ reach the far end, a Tentacle may snipe from a doorway. Kill it then break\
      \ vases to find three valuable Nali Fruit Seeds. Collect these and Tarydium\
      \ Shards from this side of the doorway.\nEnter the doorway and drop into the\
      \ water beyond. Follow the tunnel and you will be at the bottom of a well, where\
      \ there is a box of 50 Bullets, a [[Super Health Pack]] and two boxes of 10\
      \ Flak Shells. Return to the cave; you will have to fight a SkaarjWarrior that\
      \ has appeared here. That done, return to the cemetary.\n\nTime now to enter\
      \ the abbey, so go round to the front door. Enter and go down a couple of steps\
      \ to reach a small hallway where barrels reveal a can of 12 Eightballs. Enter\
      \ the main abbey room. A Nali Priest prays here before a statue on the altar;\
      \ before disturbing him, open vases to get a Clip and 2 sets of Bandages. The\
      \ aisles between the pews reveal a Health Pack and, amongst dead Nali, a diary\
      \ [3].\n\nGo up to the Nali Priest. He will awake from his prayer and lead you\
      \ to the back of the abbey, where he opens a secret door, then he will lead\
      \ you back to the altar and bow at you. Go behind the statue to get an Assault\
      \ Vest. Then, go through the secret door he opened.\n\nClimb some steps and\
      \ hop across a gap to a balcony above the main abbey room. There is a Clip and\
      \ 2 Health Packs on this balcony. Then, follow the walkway round past a vase\
      \ that contains Bandages to a lift in the tower. Ride the lift to the tower\
      \ loft, where there are two boxes of 10 Flak Shells and an excellent [[Flak\
      \ Cannon]] gun. Grab the gear. You are ready to move on now, so leave the abbey.\
      \ Watch out as you do so, because you may be attacked by a SkaarjWarrior as\
      \ you leave. If you do, then kill it.\n\nLeave Harobed Village and set off down\
      \ the canyon. As you descend the canyon towards the huge alien structure, you\
      \ will pass a Nali Healing Fruit and two Clips near a human corpse. Collect\
      \ what you need. As you approach a large pool of dirty water beneath the alien\
      \ installation, you may meet a [[Manta]]. You will also be attacked by a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ - this is a good opportunity to test out your Flak Cannon.\n\nKill the creatures,\
      \ collect the Nali Healing Fruit from either corner where the land meets the\
      \ water if you need to, then prepare to cross the bridge.\n\nCross the bridge\
      \ as far as you can. Watch out for Flies coming out of the water. The bridge\
      \ is damaged in the middle, so take a dip and use the protruding metal girder\
      \ to get across to the other end of where the bridge should be. As you step\
      \ on to dry land, a SkaarjWarrior will come round the corner that you should\
      \ kill.\n\nKill the Skaarj and (if you want) shoot the explosive Tarydium barrels\
      \ but don't stand too close. A high-tech entrance to the rock face is here,\
      \ near a strange unfamiliar humanoid corpse. Ignore the corpse for now, and\
      \ collect what you need of the Nali Healing Fruit and Eightballs here. Finally,\
      \ go through the metal doors to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n\
