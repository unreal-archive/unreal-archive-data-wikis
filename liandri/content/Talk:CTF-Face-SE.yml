      <p>I have some other discoveries I made (rather quickly) while playing both\
      \ maps: One-the towers scale has been increased, but not uniformly. The wideness\
      \ is larger when compared to the original Face. Two-the entire asteroid is obviously\
      \ redone do an extense (the slope going to the middle of the asteroid seems\
      \ steeper, but I'm not sure), the shape of the sections where the two towers\
      \ sit are obviously more jagged than the original Face. And the minor spawn\
      \ points and other actor changes seems reasonable too. --<a href=\"/User:Jet_v4.3.5\"\
      \ title=\"User:Jet v4.3.5\">Jet v4.3.5</a>\n</p>\n<dl><dd> I'm pretty certain\
      \ the architecture of the two maps is the same.  The differences are that the\
      \ spawn points are moved behind the tower to prevent spawn camping, the teleporter\
      \ exits are a few feet above the entrances to prevent portal camping, and the\
      \ ripper is replaced with a minigun so freshly spawned players have a better\
      \ starting weapon. — <a href=\"/User:Haarg\" title=\"User:Haarg\">Haarg</a>\
