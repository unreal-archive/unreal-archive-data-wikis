      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>You start in the entrance to the Skaarj installation. Ahead is a metal\
      \ door. To the right is a panel which reads [1]. Approach the metal door, which\
      \ opens before you. Step through into the large room beyond.\n</p><p>You are\
      \ in a tall chamber with large tanks of moving water to either side. Directly\
      \ ahead, a lift to a floor above is in the raised position. Approach the tank\
      \ to the right; in front of it you will find a box of 50 Bullets. Then, go round\
      \ to the right of the tank. There, you will find a <a href=\"/Minigun\" title=\"\
      Minigun\">Minigun</a> which is useful (in secondary fire) for killing the <a\
      \ href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\">Brute</a> that approaches from ahead. Kill\
      \ said Brute. Then, watch your back for another Brute that arrives on the scene\
      \ and kill that too. Continue round this tank to the back of the room and collect\
      \ another box of 50 Bullets from behind the tank there.\n</p><p>Look to either\
      \ side. At this end of the room on this side is a doorway. On the other side\
      \ is the other tank with supplies round its base, and another doorway. For your\
      \ first move, enter the doorway on this side of the room. You will arrive in\
      \ a foyer where your passage into the room beyond is blocked by some hefty electric\
      \ beams. A panel here gives you some information [2].\n</p><p>Leave this foyer\
      \ and cross the main room to the other large water tank. At this end you can\
      \ collect a box of 50 Bullets. At the other end, you can collect another box\
      \ of 50 Bullets. Round the wall side of this tank, you can collect a useful\
      \ <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault\
      \ Vest</a>. You will also see a box of 8 Rifle Rounds raised on a storage box,\
      \ but you can't reach it yet. So, stick with the Minigun and go through the\
      \ doorway on this side of the room opposite the one through to the electric\
      \ beams.\n</p><p>One short corridor later, you are in a control room. Ahead\
      \ are two large hinged electrodes. To the right, a SkaarjScout operates a control\
      \ panel. Kill the Skaarj with the Minigun then read the panel. It says the same\
      \ as the previous one, [2].\n</p><p>There's a large lever by the panel. Press\
      \ it and look round at the hinged electrodes to the left. They move into a junction\
      \ box and you will see the electric field reroute through the mechanism. The\
      \ message on the panel changes [3].\n</p><p>A SkaarjScout comes running in through\
      \ the corridor. Kill it, then go back outside to the main room. Cross the room\
      \ to the entrance that was blocked before. The beams are deactivated, the panel\
      \ reading a familiar message [3].\n</p><p>Go through the opening and into the\
      \ room beyond. There, you will find a large lever and two boxes of 50 Bullets.\
      \ Collect the ammo then press the lever; make your way back out to the main\
      \ room, and you will see that the large central lift between the two tanks has\
      \ come down. Step aboard (you'll have to go round the other side) and collect\
      \ the <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a> you find\
      \ there, then select said weapon.\nAfter a short pause, the lift will rise.\
      \ You will be in an upper area above the main room below. Here, you will be\
      \ attacked by a pair of SkaarjAssassins that come from either side, so kill\
      \ them, then step off the lift and look around.\n</p><p>Two walkways run on\
      \ either side of the tanks. Four UMS drop boxes have fallen in through this\
      \ room's open roof and have landed around the top of the lift. Open them for\
      \ two 50 Bullet CAR Clips, a pack of 10 Grenades and a <a href=\"/Rocket_Pack#Unreal:_RTNP\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Rocket Pack\">pack of 10 Rockets</a>. Then,\
      \ make sure you are on the walkway on to which the exit from the lift faces.\
      \ There is a <a href=\"/Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health Pack\"\
      >Health Pack</a> in either direction on this walkway. Collect what you need,\
      \ then go down to the end of the walkway that was to the right as you exited\
      \ the lift. You will find wooden crates there that reveal a box of 10 Flak Shells\
      \ and a box of 8 Rifle Rounds. Try not to fall through the window in the floor\
      \ here.\n</p><p>Return to the lift and cross over to the far side of the room\
      \ on to the other walkway. Look in either direction; to the right you will see\
      \ a corridor entrance. Go to the left for now. At the end of the walkway, you\
      \ will find wooden crates that reveal a Health Pack.\n</p><p>Now for the fun\
      \ part. Look through the floor window into the room below. You will see the\
      \ box on top of which was the ammo you couldn't reach before. So, jump through\
      \ the glass window (which smashes under your weight) such that you land on top\
      \ of the box and collect the box of 8 Rifle Rounds there.\n</p><p>Once you have\
      \ the ammo, return to the higher lift control room to reactivate the central\
      \ lift. Ride the lift then at the top go back round the sides of the lift on\
      \ to the second walkway. There, go to the right and head for the corridor entrance.\n\
      </p><p>Enter the corridor. It leads you round to the left and out on to a clockwise\
      \ curving balcony above an empty horseshoe-shaped room below with a large structure\
      \ in the centre. Step on to the start of the balcony and collect the box of\
      \ 50 Bullets there, then head off round the balcony.\n</p><p>Follow the balcony\
      \ round. About half way round, you will see or be seen by a SkaarjWarrior guarding\
      \ the balcony. Take it out with the Minigun or <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a>,\
      \ then collect a Health Pack from near a metal panel on the wall at the half\
      \ way point. From near the metal panel, drop off to the floor of the room below.\n\
      </p><p>The floor follows the whole of the area round, but the only area of interest\
      \ is at the central point below where you collected the Health Pack. There,\
      \ you can collect two boxes of 50 Bullets from between the balcony support pillars.\
      \ Collect the ammo and continue through between the pillars, arriving on a wide\
      \ lift which takes you up behind the metal panel, which opens. Before going\
      \ back out on to the balcony though, go into a recess on the other side of the\
      \ lift from the panel to collect a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a>. When you're done, step\
      \ back out on to the balcony. The panel soon closes again.\nContinue clockwise\
      \ round the balcony. At the far end, you will find another box of 50 Bullets,\
      \ then you will go round a stretch of corridor and find yourself on a conveyor\
      \ belt. The conveyor belt leads you towards a panel that a SkaarjScout is operating.\
      \ Follow the belt and use your Minigun to kill the Skaarj. As you reach the\
      \ corner where the Skaarj was operating the panel, you will see that the conveyor\
      \ is about to lead off towards some hefty mashing jaws. Step off the belt and\
      \ read the panel [4].\n</p><p>Save your game now. The next section is awkward.\
      \ You could be forgiven for saving several times to avoid the frustration of\
      \ having to do it all again.\n</p><p>Let the conveyor belt lead you towards\
      \ the first two pairs mashing jaws. As you approach, they will open and close\
      \ slowly. These ones are easy enough to go through without being squished. However,\
      \ after an S-bend in the conveyor you will have two more that are tougher to\
      \ get through. Make your way through these and follow the belt's next corner\
      \ round to the right. A straight section and one more corner later, you are\
      \ at the last two pairs of mashing jaws. These ones are extremely tough. Go\
      \ through the first and step off the conveyor to the side - if you approach\
      \ the last pair of jaws you will reveal a SkaarjScout lurking beyond. With a\
      \ bit of luck, the Skaarj will chase forwards and be mulched by the jaws. If\
      \ not, then kill it normally. You could also try and jump off the conveyor to\
      \ the area near the lava. Watch out for a Brute that comes out from alcoves\
      \ to the left in the corridor beyond and approaches. If you jumped off and saw\
      \ it before crossing the trap, it's likely that the Skaarj and the Brute will\
      \ start fighting each other.\n</p><p>Kill them or wait for them to die, then\
      \ save your game and negotiate the final pair of jaws. In the corridor beyond,\
      \ destroy a wooden crate on the left for a can of 12 Eightballs. Follow the\
      \ corridor; soon you will arrive on a raised walkway that follows the back of\
      \ an open room to the left which has three large unbreakable windows to the\
      \ great outdoors. Hop down into the room and you can collect an <a href=\"/Eightball_Gun\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Eightball Gun\">Eightball Gun</a> from beneath\
      \ the central window, plus two Health Packs from near gratings at the far end.\
      \ Collect what you need of the gear then climb up some steps at the Health Pack\
      \ end to return to the raised walkway.\n</p><p>Follow the walkway as it turns\
      \ back into a corridor. Go into the corridor and follow the next corner round\
      \ to the right; you will emerge in a control room inside the large structure\
      \ you saw from the curving balcony earlier. A SkaarjScout attacks from a raised\
      \ balcony round the edge of the room. Kill the Skaarj then look around; in the\
      \ centre of the room is a large glass window recessed in the floor. Two cans\
      \ of 12 Eightballs sit on the floor beyond the window. Go round the window and\
      \ collect them; then, as there's nothing else productive you can do in here,\
      \ jump through the floor window (which smashes under your weight) into the room\
      \ below.\n</p><p>Look around. You are in a low-ceilinged room with grids in\
      \ the floor that look down into a room full of molten metal. In one direction,\
      \ this room is a dead-end, so proceed through it in the other direction. As\
      \ you approach a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> lying in\
      \ the centre of the floor, there will be an explosion to the left as a <a href=\"\
      /Behemoth\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Behemoth\">Behemoth</a> blasts its\
      \ way out through the wall.\n</p><p>Collect the Stinger then use your recently\
      \ re-supplied Eightball Gun to smash the Behemoth. Enter the Behemoth's little\
      \ alcove for two cans of 12 Eightballs. Leave the alcove and cross this end\
      \ of the low-ceilinged room; you will emerge in a walkway space beside a huge\
      \ noisy pipe within a much larger room. Continue along past the noisy pipe,\
      \ and round with the curve of the pipe into the area where the walkway space\
      \ opens out beyond. Be prepared to meet three <a href=\"/Pupae\" title=\"Pupae\"\
      >Pupae</a> there; Eightballs seem fairly effective.\n</p><p>There is a lift\
      \ at the back of the area you are then in. Step on and ride it to the top. One\
      \ short low-ceilinged corridor later, and you are on a raised platform above\
      \ the area with the huge pipe. From here is a bridge across the room to another\
      \ platform, but a SkaarjScout that sees you here usually presses a plunger at\
      \ the far side of this platform that destroys the bridge. That might not happen\
      \ though, if you're quick.\n</p><p>Kill the Skaarj then go to the right following\
      \ the wall to collect two boxes of 10 Flak Shells from behind some large storage\
      \ boxes. Emerge back on to the platform and look around.\n</p><p>To the right\
      \ is the broken bridge. Ahead, the entrance to a corridor. Ignore the corridor,\
      \ and go to the broken bridge. Take a run jump and you can make it across the\
      \ gap. Once on the other side, look around again. To the right is another, darkened\
      \ corridor entrance. To the left are two boxes of 50 Bullets by some storage\
      \ boxes and a door. Collect the ammo and try the door; it is locked. So, go\
      \ to the darkened corridor entrance.\n</p><p>Follow the short corridor. The\
      \ corridor turns into a vertical shaft to another corridor below; drop down\
      \ and kill the Pupa that attacks from the left. To the left is the only way\
      \ that you can go from down here, towards a door at the end of this corridor.\
      \ Approach the door and go through it.\n</p><p>You will emerge in a minor control\
      \ room. There's a Nali in the middle of this room - he may summon you or he\
      \ may be afraid. Either way, watch out for a SkaarjAssassin that drops in through\
      \ the left of the two glass ceiling windows. Kill the Skaarj (try not to kill\
      \ the Nali in the process).\n</p><p>Follow the Nali if it is willing. If not,\
      \ what it would show you towards is a corner of the room to the left under an\
      \ overhang where there is a Shield Belt beneath a light fitting. Collect the\
      \ belt and also the Toxin Suit from the raised area to the right, then go towards\
      \ the exit at the back.\n</p><p>Go through the double doors there. Beyond, you\
      \ will find a lift. Step aboard and ride it to the top; you will come out in\
      \ a corridor that leads out between boxes into a pump room operated by a SkaarjAssassin.\
      \ Kill the Skaarj. Leave the pump room to the left down a wide corridor; follow\
      \ its corners and you will soon emerge through the previously locked doors back\
      \ out where you jumped across the broken bridge. This time, run jump back across\
      \ the broken bridge and enter the brightly lit corridor entrance that you ignored\
      \ before to the right.\n</p><p>You will arrive at the top of a short lift shaft\
      \ downwards. Drop down and into the corridor below. Go along this corridor,\
      \ passing an entrance to the right, and poke your head round the next corner\
      \ to Flak bomb a Behemoth patrolling a flight of long, shallow steps that lead\
      \ down to the floor below where the large pipe is. You don't want to go down\
      \ there yet, so go back round into the corridor and through the entrance near\
      \ the bottom of the lift. You will emerge on a low platform beneath the broken\
      \ bridge with a lever and a strange readout to the left. You have a view of\
      \ the large pipe ahead.\nActivate the lever. The slider needle will move from\
      \ black through purple, red, and orange, finally reaching yellow. An alarm will\
      \ sound. The ground will shake as the pressure builds up then with considerable\
      \ force a section of the large pipe will explode. Drop to the floor below and\
      \ grenade two Pupae that attack there. Your next aim is to enter the damaged\
      \ section of pipe, but first go under the balcony where you activated the lever\
      \ to collect two boxes of 10 Flak Shells.\n</p><p>Enter the pipe. You could\
      \ go either way along it, but to the right would reveal nothing useful, so make\
      \ a left. The pipe will curve round a number of times, before leading you out\
      \ into a larger mechanism chamber with molten metal below gratings in the floor.\n\
      </p><p>Steep steps climb the sloping side of this otherwise empty chamber to\
      \ the left. Jump up them one by one and go through an opening at the top to\
      \ emerge on a conveyor belt that will try to push you back upwards. The conveyor\
      \ system winds down round to the floor of a large storage room. Descend the\
      \ ramps but watch out for a Behemoth that attacks from the right as you reach\
      \ the bottom.\n</p><p>There are plenty of nooks and crannies down here but they\
      \ reveal nothing. So, head straight for the two exits ahead. Go first to the\
      \ one in the far right corner, past a tank of molten metal. You will find that\
      \ it is barred off. So, go back across the room and approach the other exit.\
      \ Climb the short ramp to this exit, which is open, but as you do so, an alarm\
      \ sounds and bars slam down over the doorway. A Brute blasts a hole in the wall\
      \ to the right of the door and attacks - kill it then jump in through its hole.\n\
      </p><p>You are in a short stretch of corridor that joins up with the corridor\
      \ leading from the newly barred exit. Collect the Assault Vest here, then go\
      \ through past the passage to the door into the furthest corridor. Go to the\
      \ right and press a lever at the end of the corridor there - a lift descends\
      \ at the other end of this section of the corridor. Step aboard and the lift\
      \ rises automatically to an upper corridor, whereupon you will be attacked by\
      \ a SkaarjAssassin whom you must kill.\n</p><p>Step off the lift into the Skaarj's\
      \ little alcove for two Clips. Then go back across the lift and step off at\
      \ the oher end. You will find a room off to the left where two Pupae drop off\
      \ ceiling beams and attack.\n</p><p>Enter the room of Pupae. There, you will\
      \ find a locked door with a mechanism to one side. Press the large square button\
      \ on the mechanism and it activates, opening the locked doors. Step through\
      \ the doorway - watch out for four Pupae that attack you from ahead and to the\
      \ right. Look around; you are on a raised area above the conveyor and storage\
      \ room below. Go round to the far right for two Health Packs. Then, go to the\
      \ back of the raised area and head to the right - two more Pupae will jump down\
      \ off the roof of the lava chamber, so kill them.\n</p><p>Visit the corner here\
      \ and look down through the hole in the floor in this area. It looks down upon\
      \ the other exit from the storage room, which is no longer barred. Drop down\
      \ and head through the exit. Enter the dirt-floored maintenance corridor beyond\
      \ and follow it round to the right. You will arrive in a slightly fogged room\
      \ where a group of four Pupae drop out of a ceiling vent. Kill them all.\nThis\
      \ room has a large pipe full of flowing molten metal, and several consoles.\
      \ Go to the right towards the lava pipe and enter the deepest part of the room\
      \ in that direction - you will find a crawlspace under the pipe that contains\
      \ a Pupa. Kill the Pupa then go through the crawlspace - you enter a large room\
      \ behind the pipe where you can grab a GES <a href=\"/Biorifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Biorifle\">Biorifle</a> and two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge.\nReturn\
      \ through the crawlspace back into the foggy room. Head through the room in\
      \ the other direction, then take either route, they both go to the same place\
      \ - head to the right at the end, and kill a SkaarjWarrior that ambushes you\
      \ in this area (the GES Biorifle seems fairly suitable).\n</p><p>You will come\
      \ out in another small foggy area by the lava pipe. Go to the back of this area\
      \ and you will find another crawlspace under the pipe to the right, this one\
      \ also guarded by a Pupa. Go through it. You arrive on a walkway near a pool\
      \ of molten metal that has spilled out of a broken pipe. You are actually beneath\
      \ the low ceilinged room you entered after the mashing conveyor earlier, just\
      \ as a curiosity... you can see it through grids in the ceiling. Anyway, follow\
      \ the walkway round the edge of the pool of metal and you will find that the\
      \ mouth of the shattered pipe is accessible by crossing a fallen girder. Cimb\
      \ inside.\n</p><p>Follow the winding pipe. Rounding a corner, expect to be unpleasantly\
      \ surprised as the section of pipe you are in collapses into the molten metal\
      \ behind you, leaving you trapped with three Pupae ahead. Slime the Pupae, and\
      \ try not to be incinerated!\n</p><p>Get out of the newly sloping section of\
      \ the pipe and continue round its winding course. As you follow the last straight,\
      \ part of the pipe wall ahead to the left explodes, revealing a hole out into\
      \ another room. For now, go past the hole, and into the very last dead end of\
      \ the pipe for an Eightball Gun and a can of 12 Eightballs. Return to the hole\
      \ in the pipe and jump out. You are in a basic storage facility. A SkaarjScout\
      \ attacks from a recess behind as you emerge; kill it, then go into its recess\
      \ for a Health Pack.\n</p><p>Step out into the facility and look around. There\
      \ are doors to either side (the one on the right is damaged). Go into the four\
      \ corners of the central part of the room and behind pillars in said corners\
      \ for four cans of 12 Eightballs, then approach the undamaged door (the one\
      \ with the red sign over it). The door opens as you approach, to reveal a Behemoth\
      \ that charges you. Kill the Behemoth, then watch out for a Brute that blasts\
      \ its way out through the damaged door at the other end of the room as you do\
      \ so. Kill the Brute too.\n</p><p>Go across the storage facility to the alcove\
      \ the Brute came out of. It's a small store where you can pick up a Super Health\
      \ Pack and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Then, go back across the room and go\
      \ through the undamaged doors to the corridor beyond.\n</p><p>The corridor leads\
      \ you round to the right into a room full of water pools. In the room, there's\
      \ a lift by a yellow post to the right, and at the far end of this room there\
      \ is an Assault Vest behind a barrier which you cannot jump over. You want that\
      \ armour though. So, jump into the water storage tanks. Follow the tanks round\
      \ so that you enter the area beneath the entrance corridor. After killing a\
      \ <a href=\"/Slith\" title=\"Slith\">Slith</a> prowling there, you will see\
      \ a grating in the wall to the right. Use the <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\"\
      \ title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a> to destroy this grating\
      \ and reveal a duct beyond. Enter the long narrow duct. You will be led along\
      \ for a while and then to the right, after which you can surface and climb out\
      \ into area containing the Assault Vest.\n</p><p>Collect the armour and use\
      \ the supports for the barrier on this side to jump back out to the main room.\
      \ You're done here now, so head for the lift by the yellow post and climb aboard.\
      \ After a short ride, you will be in a large low-roofed room containing vertical\
      \ pipes and pumping machines. The room is guarded by a pair of SkaarjWarriors\
      \ whom you should kill. Then, you can look around the room and admire the machinery,\
      \ but there's nothing useful so head to the far corner from where you entered\
      \ this area to find there another lift by another yellow post.\n</p><p>Proceed\
      \ to he next tier of this multi-levelled structure. The next floor has a bunch\
      \ more machinery and a SkaarjAssassin on guard - kill the Skaarj - but once\
      \ again there is nothing useful, so cross the to the far side of this third\
      \ level and ride the lift by the yellow post there. This lift will take you\
      \ up to the top level. Entering this room and approaching a lift to a balcony\
      \ ahead, you will be attacked by another SkaarjAssassin that drops down from\
      \ the rafters. Kill it.\n</p><p>Approach the lift at the back but go past it,\
      \ entering the area under the balcony. By going to either side of a large central\
      \ pipe, you will be able to procure two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Now, ride the\
      \ lift up to the balcony. There, you will see a valve hatch on the floor above\
      \ the pipe beneath the balcony, and a double red switch on the wall to the left.\
      \ Activate the red switch. The valve hatch opens and is clamped into position\
      \ by a pair of mechanical arms. Approach the open valve and drop through it,\
      \ landing with a splosh in the water pipe below. Ready your Combat Assault Rifle\
      \ or Minigun at this point, if you have the ammo.\n</p><p>The pipe leads off\
      \ on a straight for a while. Follow it, and you will eventually curve round\
      \ to the left. Entering the next straight, you will be approaching a tank where\
      \ a Slith is circling. Kill the Slith and enter the tank - you will see that\
      \ the pipe continues vertically downwards from the floor of the tank. So, submerge\
      \ and follow it. The pipe curves round in a U-bend, bringing you back up into\
      \ another similar tank also patrolled by a Slith.\n</p><p>Kill the Slith and\
      \ enter this second tank. From there, the pipe leads off horizontally again.\
      \ Follow it, going round the next curve to the right. There, you will see that\
      \ you are coming to the end of the pipe at a water pool ahead. A Behemoth has\
      \ seen you from a ledge and attacks; kill it with your <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\"\
      \ title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a> or Eightball Gun.\n</p><p>Enter\
      \ the pool. You will find a ramp out on to the Behemoth's ledge, so climb out\
      \ and collect the two cans of 12 Eightballs from either side. Continuing back\
      \ into this area, you can collect two Health Packs from either side of a short\
      \ corridor entrance.\n</p><p>Go through the short corridor. You will emerge\
      \ on a genuinely huge octagonal lift with a button ahead. Go forwards and press\
      \ the button, and the lift starts to descend rapidly. After what seems like\
      \ a very long journey, during which time you will be kept busy by a SkaarjBerserker\
      \ that drops down from above, you will eventually stop at the bottom of the\
      \ lift shaft. If you can't see it immediately, use your <a href=\"/Searchlight\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Searchlight\">Searchlight</a> to find doors\
      \ leading off one of the dingy walls here. Go through the doors and enter the\
      \ corridor beyond to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\
      \nYou start in the entrance to the Skaarj installation. Ahead is a metal door.\
      \ To the right is a panel which reads [1]. Approach the metal door, which opens\
      \ before you. Step through into the large room beyond.\n\nYou are in a tall\
      \ chamber with large tanks of moving water to either side. Directly ahead, a\
      \ lift to a floor above is in the raised position. Approach the tank to the\
      \ right; in front of it you will find a box of 50 Bullets. Then, go round to\
      \ the right of the tank. There, you will find a [[Minigun]] which is useful\
      \ (in secondary fire) for killing the [[Brute]] that approaches from ahead.\
      \ Kill said Brute. Then, watch your back for another Brute that arrives on the\
      \ scene and kill that too. Continue round this tank to the back of the room\
      \ and collect another box of 50 Bullets from behind the tank there.\n\nLook\
      \ to either side. At this end of the room on this side is a doorway. On the\
      \ other side is the other tank with supplies round its base, and another doorway.\
      \ For your first move, enter the doorway on this side of the room. You will\
      \ arrive in a foyer where your passage into the room beyond is blocked by some\
      \ hefty electric beams. A panel here gives you some information [2].\n\nLeave\
      \ this foyer and cross the main room to the other large water tank. At this\
      \ end you can collect a box of 50 Bullets. At the other end, you can collect\
      \ another box of 50 Bullets. Round the wall side of this tank, you can collect\
      \ a useful [[Assault Vest]]. You will also see a box of 8 Rifle Rounds raised\
      \ on a storage box, but you can't reach it yet. So, stick with the Minigun and\
      \ go through the doorway on this side of the room opposite the one through to\
      \ the electric beams.\n\nOne short corridor later, you are in a control room.\
      \ Ahead are two large hinged electrodes. To the right, a SkaarjScout operates\
      \ a control panel. Kill the Skaarj with the Minigun then read the panel. It\
      \ says the same as the previous one, [2].\n\nThere's a large lever by the panel.\
      \ Press it and look round at the hinged electrodes to the left. They move into\
      \ a junction box and you will see the electric field reroute through the mechanism.\
      \ The message on the panel changes [3].\n\nA SkaarjScout comes running in through\
      \ the corridor. Kill it, then go back outside to the main room. Cross the room\
      \ to the entrance that was blocked before. The beams are deactivated, the panel\
      \ reading a familiar message [3].\n\nGo through the opening and into the room\
      \ beyond. There, you will find a large lever and two boxes of 50 Bullets. Collect\
      \ the ammo then press the lever; make your way back out to the main room, and\
      \ you will see that the large central lift between the two tanks has come down.\
      \ Step aboard (you'll have to go round the other side) and collect the [[Flak\
      \ Cannon]] you find there, then select said weapon.\nAfter a short pause, the\
      \ lift will rise. You will be in an upper area above the main room below. Here,\
      \ you will be attacked by a pair of SkaarjAssassins that come from either side,\
      \ so kill them, then step off the lift and look around.\n\nTwo walkways run\
      \ on either side of the tanks. Four UMS drop boxes have fallen in through this\
      \ room's open roof and have landed around the top of the lift. Open them for\
      \ two 50 Bullet CAR Clips, a pack of 10 Grenades and a [[Rocket Pack#Unreal:\
      \ RTNP|pack of 10 Rockets]]. Then, make sure you are on the walkway on to which\
      \ the exit from the lift faces. There is a [[Health Pack]] in either direction\
      \ on this walkway. Collect what you need, then go down to the end of the walkway\
      \ that was to the right as you exited the lift. You will find wooden crates\
      \ there that reveal a box of 10 Flak Shells and a box of 8 Rifle Rounds. Try\
      \ not to fall through the window in the floor here.\n\nReturn to the lift and\
      \ cross over to the far side of the room on to the other walkway. Look in either\
      \ direction; to the right you will see a corridor entrance. Go to the left for\
      \ now. At the end of the walkway, you will find wooden crates that reveal a\
      \ Health Pack.\n\nNow for the fun part. Look through the floor window into the\
      \ room below. You will see the box on top of which was the ammo you couldn't\
      \ reach before. So, jump through the glass window (which smashes under your\
      \ weight) such that you land on top of the box and collect the box of 8 Rifle\
      \ Rounds there.\n\nOnce you have the ammo, return to the higher lift control\
      \ room to reactivate the central lift. Ride the lift then at the top go back\
      \ round the sides of the lift on to the second walkway. There, go to the right\
      \ and head for the corridor entrance.\n\nEnter the corridor. It leads you round\
      \ to the left and out on to a clockwise curving balcony above an empty horseshoe-shaped\
      \ room below with a large structure in the centre. Step on to the start of the\
      \ balcony and collect the box of 50 Bullets there, then head off round the balcony.\n\
      \nFollow the balcony round. About half way round, you will see or be seen by\
      \ a SkaarjWarrior guarding the balcony. Take it out with the Minigun or [[Combat\
      \ Assault Rifle]], then collect a Health Pack from near a metal panel on the\
      \ wall at the half way point. From near the metal panel, drop off to the floor\
      \ of the room below.\n\nThe floor follows the whole of the area round, but the\
      \ only area of interest is at the central point below where you collected the\
      \ Health Pack. There, you can collect two boxes of 50 Bullets from between the\
      \ balcony support pillars. Collect the ammo and continue through between the\
      \ pillars, arriving on a wide lift which takes you up behind the metal panel,\
      \ which opens. Before going back out on to the balcony though, go into a recess\
      \ on the other side of the lift from the panel to collect a [[Super Health Pack]].\
      \ When you're done, step back out on to the balcony. The panel soon closes again.\n\
      Continue clockwise round the balcony. At the far end, you will find another\
      \ box of 50 Bullets, then you will go round a stretch of corridor and find yourself\
      \ on a conveyor belt. The conveyor belt leads you towards a panel that a SkaarjScout\
      \ is operating. Follow the belt and use your Minigun to kill the Skaarj. As\
      \ you reach the corner where the Skaarj was operating the panel, you will see\
      \ that the conveyor is about to lead off towards some hefty mashing jaws. Step\
      \ off the belt and read the panel [4].\n\nSave your game now. The next section\
      \ is awkward. You could be forgiven for saving several times to avoid the frustration\
      \ of having to do it all again.\n\nLet the conveyor belt lead you towards the\
      \ first two pairs mashing jaws. As you approach, they will open and close slowly.\
      \ These ones are easy enough to go through without being squished. However,\
      \ after an S-bend in the conveyor you will have two more that are tougher to\
      \ get through. Make your way through these and follow the belt's next corner\
      \ round to the right. A straight section and one more corner later, you are\
      \ at the last two pairs of mashing jaws. These ones are extremely tough. Go\
      \ through the first and step off the conveyor to the side - if you approach\
      \ the last pair of jaws you will reveal a SkaarjScout lurking beyond. With a\
      \ bit of luck, the Skaarj will chase forwards and be mulched by the jaws. If\
      \ not, then kill it normally. You could also try and jump off the conveyor to\
      \ the area near the lava. Watch out for a Brute that comes out from alcoves\
      \ to the left in the corridor beyond and approaches. If you jumped off and saw\
      \ it before crossing the trap, it's likely that the Skaarj and the Brute will\
      \ start fighting each other.\n\nKill them or wait for them to die, then save\
      \ your game and negotiate the final pair of jaws. In the corridor beyond, destroy\
      \ a wooden crate on the left for a can of 12 Eightballs. Follow the corridor;\
      \ soon you will arrive on a raised walkway that follows the back of an open\
      \ room to the left which has three large unbreakable windows to the great outdoors.\
      \ Hop down into the room and you can collect an [[Eightball Gun]] from beneath\
      \ the central window, plus two Health Packs from near gratings at the far end.\
      \ Collect what you need of the gear then climb up some steps at the Health Pack\
      \ end to return to the raised walkway.\n\nFollow the walkway as it turns back\
      \ into a corridor. Go into the corridor and follow the next corner round to\
      \ the right; you will emerge in a control room inside the large structure you\
      \ saw from the curving balcony earlier. A SkaarjScout attacks from a raised\
      \ balcony round the edge of the room. Kill the Skaarj then look around; in the\
      \ centre of the room is a large glass window recessed in the floor. Two cans\
      \ of 12 Eightballs sit on the floor beyond the window. Go round the window and\
      \ collect them; then, as there's nothing else productive you can do in here,\
      \ jump through the floor window (which smashes under your weight) into the room\
      \ below.\n\nLook around. You are in a low-ceilinged room with grids in the floor\
      \ that look down into a room full of molten metal. In one direction, this room\
      \ is a dead-end, so proceed through it in the other direction. As you approach\
      \ a [[Stinger]] lying in the centre of the floor, there will be an explosion\
      \ to the left as a [[Behemoth]] blasts its way out through the wall.\n\nCollect\
      \ the Stinger then use your recently re-supplied Eightball Gun to smash the\
      \ Behemoth. Enter the Behemoth's little alcove for two cans of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ Leave the alcove and cross this end of the low-ceilinged room; you will emerge\
      \ in a walkway space beside a huge noisy pipe within a much larger room. Continue\
      \ along past the noisy pipe, and round with the curve of the pipe into the area\
      \ where the walkway space opens out beyond. Be prepared to meet three [[Pupae]]\
      \ there; Eightballs seem fairly effective.\n\nThere is a lift at the back of\
      \ the area you are then in. Step on and ride it to the top. One short low-ceilinged\
      \ corridor later, and you are on a raised platform above the area with the huge\
      \ pipe. From here is a bridge across the room to another platform, but a SkaarjScout\
      \ that sees you here usually presses a plunger at the far side of this platform\
      \ that destroys the bridge. That might not happen though, if you're quick.\n\
      \nKill the Skaarj then go to the right following the wall to collect two boxes\
      \ of 10 Flak Shells from behind some large storage boxes. Emerge back on to\
      \ the platform and look around.\n\nTo the right is the broken bridge. Ahead,\
      \ the entrance to a corridor. Ignore the corridor, and go to the broken bridge.\
      \ Take a run jump and you can make it across the gap. Once on the other side,\
      \ look around again. To the right is another, darkened corridor entrance. To\
      \ the left are two boxes of 50 Bullets by some storage boxes and a door. Collect\
      \ the ammo and try the door; it is locked. So, go to the darkened corridor entrance.\n\
      \nFollow the short corridor. The corridor turns into a vertical shaft to another\
      \ corridor below; drop down and kill the Pupa that attacks from the left. To\
      \ the left is the only way that you can go from down here, towards a door at\
      \ the end of this corridor. Approach the door and go through it.\n\nYou will\
      \ emerge in a minor control room. There's a Nali in the middle of this room\
      \ - he may summon you or he may be afraid. Either way, watch out for a SkaarjAssassin\
      \ that drops in through the left of the two glass ceiling windows. Kill the\
      \ Skaarj (try not to kill the Nali in the process).\n\nFollow the Nali if it\
      \ is willing. If not, what it would show you towards is a corner of the room\
      \ to the left under an overhang where there is a Shield Belt beneath a light\
      \ fitting. Collect the belt and also the Toxin Suit from the raised area to\
      \ the right, then go towards the exit at the back.\n\nGo through the double\
      \ doors there. Beyond, you will find a lift. Step aboard and ride it to the\
      \ top; you will come out in a corridor that leads out between boxes into a pump\
      \ room operated by a SkaarjAssassin. Kill the Skaarj. Leave the pump room to\
      \ the left down a wide corridor; follow its corners and you will soon emerge\
      \ through the previously locked doors back out where you jumped across the broken\
      \ bridge. This time, run jump back across the broken bridge and enter the brightly\
      \ lit corridor entrance that you ignored before to the right.\n\nYou will arrive\
      \ at the top of a short lift shaft downwards. Drop down and into the corridor\
      \ below. Go along this corridor, passing an entrance to the right, and poke\
      \ your head round the next corner to Flak bomb a Behemoth patrolling a flight\
      \ of long, shallow steps that lead down to the floor below where the large pipe\
      \ is. You don't want to go down there yet, so go back round into the corridor\
      \ and through the entrance near the bottom of the lift. You will emerge on a\
      \ low platform beneath the broken bridge with a lever and a strange readout\
      \ to the left. You have a view of the large pipe ahead.\nActivate the lever.\
      \ The slider needle will move from black through purple, red, and orange, finally\
      \ reaching yellow. An alarm will sound. The ground will shake as the pressure\
      \ builds up then with considerable force a section of the large pipe will explode.\
      \ Drop to the floor below and grenade two Pupae that attack there. Your next\
      \ aim is to enter the damaged section of pipe, but first go under the balcony\
      \ where you activated the lever to collect two boxes of 10 Flak Shells.\n\n\
      Enter the pipe. You could go either way along it, but to the right would reveal\
      \ nothing useful, so make a left. The pipe will curve round a number of times,\
      \ before leading you out into a larger mechanism chamber with molten metal below\
      \ gratings in the floor.\n\nSteep steps climb the sloping side of this otherwise\
      \ empty chamber to the left. Jump up them one by one and go through an opening\
      \ at the top to emerge on a conveyor belt that will try to push you back upwards.\
      \ The conveyor system winds down round to the floor of a large storage room.\
      \ Descend the ramps but watch out for a Behemoth that attacks from the right\
      \ as you reach the bottom.\n\nThere are plenty of nooks and crannies down here\
      \ but they reveal nothing. So, head straight for the two exits ahead. Go first\
      \ to the one in the far right corner, past a tank of molten metal. You will\
      \ find that it is barred off. So, go back across the room and approach the other\
      \ exit. Climb the short ramp to this exit, which is open, but as you do so,\
      \ an alarm sounds and bars slam down over the doorway. A Brute blasts a hole\
      \ in the wall to the right of the door and attacks - kill it then jump in through\
      \ its hole.\n\nYou are in a short stretch of corridor that joins up with the\
      \ corridor leading from the newly barred exit. Collect the Assault Vest here,\
      \ then go through past the passage to the door into the furthest corridor. Go\
      \ to the right and press a lever at the end of the corridor there - a lift descends\
      \ at the other end of this section of the corridor. Step aboard and the lift\
      \ rises automatically to an upper corridor, whereupon you will be attacked by\
      \ a SkaarjAssassin whom you must kill.\n\nStep off the lift into the Skaarj's\
      \ little alcove for two Clips. Then go back across the lift and step off at\
      \ the oher end. You will find a room off to the left where two Pupae drop off\
      \ ceiling beams and attack.\n\nEnter the room of Pupae. There, you will find\
      \ a locked door with a mechanism to one side. Press the large square button\
      \ on the mechanism and it activates, opening the locked doors. Step through\
      \ the doorway - watch out for four Pupae that attack you from ahead and to the\
      \ right. Look around; you are on a raised area above the conveyor and storage\
      \ room below. Go round to the far right for two Health Packs. Then, go to the\
      \ back of the raised area and head to the right - two more Pupae will jump down\
      \ off the roof of the lava chamber, so kill them.\n\nVisit the corner here and\
      \ look down through the hole in the floor in this area. It looks down upon the\
      \ other exit from the storage room, which is no longer barred. Drop down and\
      \ head through the exit. Enter the dirt-floored maintenance corridor beyond\
      \ and follow it round to the right. You will arrive in a slightly fogged room\
      \ where a group of four Pupae drop out of a ceiling vent. Kill them all.\nThis\
      \ room has a large pipe full of flowing molten metal, and several consoles.\
      \ Go to the right towards the lava pipe and enter the deepest part of the room\
      \ in that direction - you will find a crawlspace under the pipe that contains\
      \ a Pupa. Kill the Pupa then go through the crawlspace - you enter a large room\
      \ behind the pipe where you can grab a GES [[Biorifle]] and two 25kg cans of\
      \ Tarydium Sludge.\nReturn through the crawlspace back into the foggy room.\
      \ Head through the room in the other direction, then take either route, they\
      \ both go to the same place - head to the right at the end, and kill a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ that ambushes you in this area (the GES Biorifle seems fairly suitable).\n\
      \nYou will come out in another small foggy area by the lava pipe. Go to the\
      \ back of this area and you will find another crawlspace under the pipe to the\
      \ right, this one also guarded by a Pupa. Go through it. You arrive on a walkway\
      \ near a pool of molten metal that has spilled out of a broken pipe. You are\
      \ actually beneath the low ceilinged room you entered after the mashing conveyor\
      \ earlier, just as a curiosity... you can see it through grids in the ceiling.\
      \ Anyway, follow the walkway round the edge of the pool of metal and you will\
      \ find that the mouth of the shattered pipe is accessible by crossing a fallen\
      \ girder. Cimb inside.\n\nFollow the winding pipe. Rounding a corner, expect\
      \ to be unpleasantly surprised as the section of pipe you are in collapses into\
      \ the molten metal behind you, leaving you trapped with three Pupae ahead. Slime\
      \ the Pupae, and try not to be incinerated!\n\nGet out of the newly sloping\
      \ section of the pipe and continue round its winding course. As you follow the\
      \ last straight, part of the pipe wall ahead to the left explodes, revealing\
      \ a hole out into another room. For now, go past the hole, and into the very\
      \ last dead end of the pipe for an Eightball Gun and a can of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ Return to the hole in the pipe and jump out. You are in a basic storage facility.\
      \ A SkaarjScout attacks from a recess behind as you emerge; kill it, then go\
      \ into its recess for a Health Pack.\n\nStep out into the facility and look\
      \ around. There are doors to either side (the one on the right is damaged).\
      \ Go into the four corners of the central part of the room and behind pillars\
      \ in said corners for four cans of 12 Eightballs, then approach the undamaged\
      \ door (the one with the red sign over it). The door opens as you approach,\
      \ to reveal a Behemoth that charges you. Kill the Behemoth, then watch out for\
      \ a Brute that blasts its way out through the damaged door at the other end\
      \ of the room as you do so. Kill the Brute too.\n\nGo across the storage facility\
      \ to the alcove the Brute came out of. It's a small store where you can pick\
      \ up a Super Health Pack and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Then, go back across\
      \ the room and go through the undamaged doors to the corridor beyond.\n\nThe\
      \ corridor leads you round to the right into a room full of water pools. In\
      \ the room, there's a lift by a yellow post to the right, and at the far end\
      \ of this room there is an Assault Vest behind a barrier which you cannot jump\
      \ over. You want that armour though. So, jump into the water storage tanks.\
      \ Follow the tanks round so that you enter the area beneath the entrance corridor.\
      \ After killing a [[Slith]] prowling there, you will see a grating in the wall\
      \ to the right. Use the [[Dispersion Pistol]] to destroy this grating and reveal\
      \ a duct beyond. Enter the long narrow duct. You will be led along for a while\
      \ and then to the right, after which you can surface and climb out into area\
      \ containing the Assault Vest.\n\nCollect the armour and use the supports for\
      \ the barrier on this side to jump back out to the main room. You're done here\
      \ now, so head for the lift by the yellow post and climb aboard. After a short\
      \ ride, you will be in a large low-roofed room containing vertical pipes and\
      \ pumping machines. The room is guarded by a pair of SkaarjWarriors whom you\
      \ should kill. Then, you can look around the room and admire the machinery,\
      \ but there's nothing useful so head to the far corner from where you entered\
      \ this area to find there another lift by another yellow post.\n\nProceed to\
      \ he next tier of this multi-levelled structure. The next floor has a bunch\
      \ more machinery and a SkaarjAssassin on guard - kill the Skaarj - but once\
      \ again there is nothing useful, so cross the to the far side of this third\
      \ level and ride the lift by the yellow post there. This lift will take you\
      \ up to the top level. Entering this room and approaching a lift to a balcony\
      \ ahead, you will be attacked by another SkaarjAssassin that drops down from\
      \ the rafters. Kill it.\n\nApproach the lift at the back but go past it, entering\
      \ the area under the balcony. By going to either side of a large central pipe,\
      \ you will be able to procure two boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Now, ride the lift\
      \ up to the balcony. There, you will see a valve hatch on the floor above the\
      \ pipe beneath the balcony, and a double red switch on the wall to the left.\
      \ Activate the red switch. The valve hatch opens and is clamped into position\
      \ by a pair of mechanical arms. Approach the open valve and drop through it,\
      \ landing with a splosh in the water pipe below. Ready your Combat Assault Rifle\
      \ or Minigun at this point, if you have the ammo.\n\nThe pipe leads off on a\
      \ straight for a while. Follow it, and you will eventually curve round to the\
      \ left. Entering the next straight, you will be approaching a tank where a Slith\
      \ is circling. Kill the Slith and enter the tank - you will see that the pipe\
      \ continues vertically downwards from the floor of the tank. So, submerge and\
      \ follow it. The pipe curves round in a U-bend, bringing you back up into another\
      \ similar tank also patrolled by a Slith.\n\nKill the Slith and enter this second\
      \ tank. From there, the pipe leads off horizontally again. Follow it, going\
      \ round the next curve to the right. There, you will see that you are coming\
      \ to the end of the pipe at a water pool ahead. A Behemoth has seen you from\
      \ a ledge and attacks; kill it with your [[Rocket Launcher]] or Eightball Gun.\n\
      \nEnter the pool. You will find a ramp out on to the Behemoth's ledge, so climb\
      \ out and collect the two cans of 12 Eightballs from either side. Continuing\
      \ back into this area, you can collect two Health Packs from either side of\
      \ a short corridor entrance.\n\nGo through the short corridor. You will emerge\
      \ on a genuinely huge octagonal lift with a button ahead. Go forwards and press\
      \ the button, and the lift starts to descend rapidly. After what seems like\
      \ a very long journey, during which time you will be kept busy by a SkaarjBerserker\
      \ that drops down from above, you will eventually stop at the bottom of the\
      \ lift shaft. If you can't see it immediately, use your [[Searchlight]] to find\
      \ doors leading off one of the dingy walls here. Go through the doors and enter\
      \ the corridor beyond to exit the level.\n\n== Translator messages ==\n#\"Tarydium\
