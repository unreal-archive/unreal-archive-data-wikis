      <p>This gimmicky map is set in the Australian desert, where the local population\
      \ wants to get rid of the non-alcoholic \"Zero Beer\" and replace it with ordinary\
      \ beer. The first 4 objectives are outside where the attacking team must either\
      \ open/close a valve or destroy a set of targets using a set of vehicles. The\
      \ rest of the mission takes place inside the brewery where more valves have\
      \ to be opened in its 2 main halls.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Objectives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Destroy the Pub's Zero Beer Drainage Valve</dt>\n\
      <dd> The attackers start inside the pub and must close a valve outside of the\
      \ pub to stop the flow of Zero Beer to the pub. When exiting the pub the valve\
      \ can be found on the right, just next to the pub. The defending team spawns\
      \ on the other side of the large clearing, making it an easy job for the attackers\
      \ to turn the valve. This objective should only take a few seconds. When the\
      \ objective is completed the attackers will be rewarded with a <a href=\"/Scorpion\"\
      \ title=\"Scorpion\">Scorpion</a>, 2 <a href=\"/Hellbender\" title=\"Hellbender\"\
      >Hellbenders</a>, an <a href=\"/SPMA\" title=\"SPMA\">SPMA</a> and a <a href=\"\
      /Goliath\" title=\"Goliath\">Goliath</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> As mentioned before:\
      \ The defending team spawns on the other side of a large clearing. They do get\
      \ a <a href=\"/Lightning_Gun\" title=\"Lightning Gun\">Lightning Gun</a> in\
      \ their weapon loadout, but even then only a very skilled or very lucky team\
      \ of snipers will be able to stall the attackers here.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Stop\
      \ the Zero Beer Marketing Campaign</dt>\n<dd> Now the attacking team must destroy\
      \ a set of 5 billboards promoting Zero Beer. The first 3 can be found on or\
      \ near the clearing, and should be easy to destroy with the help of the various\
      \ vehicles. The 2 other billboards, however, are placed along the road leading\
      \ to the brewery and will take more time to destroy. The vehicles (especially\
      \ the Goliath and SPMA) are crucial for this objective. Attackers who are left\
      \ walking can pick up a <a href=\"/Armor#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\" title=\"\
      Armor\">Super Shield pack</a> and a <a href=\"/Health#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Health\">Big Keg O' Health</a> on the cricket field on the left of\
      \ the clearing. The SPMA enables the attackers to destroy the billboards without\
      \ having to go through the canyon, although it may take longer.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The first 2-3 of the billboards are hard to defend, as the attackers\
      \ can destroy them from a long distance using the Goliath and SPMA. The defenders\
      \ do have an <a href=\"/AVRiL\" title=\"AVRiL\">AVRiL</a> to help fight the\
      \ vehicles and 2 <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"Turrets\"\
      >Minigun Turrets</a> to fight the attackers on foot. These are all located near\
      \ the defenders' first spawnpoints. When the attacking team has completed the\
      \ first objective the defenders respawn at the other end of the road, near the\
      \ last billboard, after dying. There they can use 2 <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"\
      Manta\">Manta</a>'s, a <a href=\"/Raptor\" title=\"Raptor\">Raptor</a> and a\
      \ <a href=\"/Cicada\" title=\"Cicada\">Cicada</a>. When the defending team needs\
      \ more vehicles to help in their defense, they can choose to press Q (by default)\
      \ to respawn next to this set of vehicles. When needed they can also pick up\
      \ a <a href=\"/UDamage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UDamage\">UDamage</a>\
      \ along the way.  </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Pump the Fresh Water to the Brewery</dt>\n\
      <dd> After completing the previous objective both teams respawn. The situation\
      \ and objective are similar to the first objective. The attacking team spawns\
      \ near a lake, where they must open a valve. The defending team spawns on the\
      \ other side of the canyon, near the brewery, making this objective as easy\
      \ and quick as the first one. After the valve has been opened another Scorpion\
      \ and 2 Hellbenders will spawn at the start of the road to the next objective\
      \ and a Goliath will spawn next to the lake, opposite to the large red Zero\
      \ Beer sign. Another Keg O' Health and Super Shield Pack can be found next to\
      \ this tank.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Since the defending team is spawned so far\
      \ away, they'd have to be very quick and lucky to stall the attackers. This\
      \ time is probably best spent gearing up for the next objective.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Destroy the Brewery Gate Locks</dt>\n<dd> With these new vehicles the\
      \ attacking team must make their way through a canyon and destroy 2 Gate Locks\
      \ that lock the Main Gate to the Brewery. There are 2 routes leading from the\
      \ lake, right next to each other. The high road leads to a vantage point for\
      \ snipers, with a clear view on the Gate Locks. Players using vehicles will\
      \ have to follow the pipeline to get to the gate. 1 shot from the Goliath's\
      \ main cannon is enough to destroy a lock, so 3 shots should complete this objective.\
      \ Another tactic the attackers can use is using the alt-fire of the <a href=\"\
      /Redeemer\" title=\"Redeemer\">Redeemer</a> (which can be found in the middle\
      \ of the lake) to guide a rocket to the Gate Locks and destroy all 3 of them\
      \ at once. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending team has plenty of recourses to\
      \ help them in this fight. Not only are there 3 Minigun Turrets, but the defending\
      \ team also has 2 Scorpions and a <a href=\"/Paladin\" title=\"Paladin\">Paladin</a>.\
      \ The Paladin's alt-fire can be used to shield the gate locks. The vehicles\
      \ from the previous objective can still be used, but the defenders will have\
      \ to drive through the attacker's base to reach them. However, the Cicada and\
      \ Raptor also enable the defenders to reach any place in the map quickly. They\
      \ could even go to the brewery and snatch the UDamage there. It may take a while,\
      \ but with the little means they have to fend off the Goliath, it might be well\
      \ worth it.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Open the Brew Tank Water Valve</dt>\n<dd> Now\
      \ the attackers will respawn near the gates, outside of the brewery where the\
      \ remaining 5 objectives are located. The entrance to the brewery is on the\
      \ left, where the attackers will find 2 weapon lockers and some \"Healthmite\"\
      . The valve is placed inside the brewery, against the left wall, behind the\
      \ large group of boxes. Attackers can also double-jump onto the forklift and\
      \ then onto the pile of boxes to reach the objective quicker.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd>\
      \ There are plenty of useful pickups hidden between the piles of boxes, such\
      \ as a UDamage and a Shield pack. Since the defenders spawn closer to the objective\
      \ than the attackers they will likely walk away with the pickups, giving them\
      \ a slight advantage in 1-on-1 combat. There's also another forklift that can\
      \ take the defenders on top of the piles of boxes, which can help them ambush\
      \ the attackers. Another tool that's very useful for an ambush is the <a href=\"\
      /Bio-Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bio-Rifle\">Bio-Rifle</a> in the\
      \ weapon loadout. There's also a Keg O'Health and a Super Shield Pack near the\
      \ huge tanks near the defenders' spawnpoints, outside of the brewery. Last but\
      \ not least the defenders can also use a Redeemer that's on top of the pile\
      \ of boxes near the 2nd forklift (the moving one).</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Find and\
      \ Deliver the missing Hops Canisters</dt>\n<dd> The missing Hops Canister can\
      \ be found further down the hall, on the left side in between 2 large boiler\
      \ tanks. Most of the defenders will be waiting in this area, either on the conveyor\
      \ belt to the right or near the door up ahead. If any member of the attacking\
      \ team walks over the Hops Canister the objective is completed.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Insert the Hops Canister into the Addition Module</dt>\n<dd> The Canister\
      \ must now be carried to the Addition Module, which is located in the next hall.\
      \ There are 2 opened doors in the back of the hall. The door on the left leads\
      \ to the objective, while the door on the right will lead to the defending team's\
      \ spawnpoints and a quick death by their <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Sentinels</a>. Attackers must turn right after entering\
      \ the next hall. There the attackers can either double-jump over the conveyor\
      \ belt or take the stairs. The Addition Module is on the right wall behind a\
      \ set of 2 large tanks. When the carrier of the Hops Canister reaches the Module\
      \ the objective is completed. If the carrier dies along the way another attacker\
      \ can pick up the Canister from his/her corpse and continue the journey to the\
      \ objective.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> This route features a series of narrow passages,\
      \ such as the door to the 2nd hall and the stairs over the conveyor belt. These\
      \ passages make excellent chokepoints and the defending team would be wise to\
      \ focus their attention on these passages. The Bio-Rifle, <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\"\
      \ title=\"Shock Rifle\">Shock Rifle</a> and <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"\
      Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a> are the most valuable weapons for this\
      \ kind of defense.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Activate the Brew Kettles</dt>\n<dd> This\
      \ is another quick objective. The switch to activate the Brew Kettles is located\
      \ on the wall opposite to the previous objective. Not only does it take only\
      \ a few seconds to get there from the previous objective, it's also completed\
      \ instantly when any member of the attacking team is near it. When 2 attackers\
      \ have made it into the hall they can thus complete 2 objectives almost simultaneously.\
      \ </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Because this objective is reached almost instantly, it's\
      \ very hard to defend. Any attacker can just jump over the conveyor, dodge-jump\
      \ to the switch and complete the objective. The best that the defenders can\
      \ do is to use the tactics described in the previous objective and prevent any\
      \ attacker from walking through the doorway. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Get the New\
      \ Beer into the Fermentation Tanks</dt>\n<dd> There's just one more valve that\
      \ has to be opened now. Further down the hall one will find 3 large tanks on\
      \ the left (all inserted in the ground) with a walkway hovering over them. The\
      \ valve is on the end of this walkway and the stair leading to it is next to\
      \ a tank, next to the switch for the Brew Kettles. The walkway itself is narrow\
      \ and exposed to enemy fire. This makes it easier for the defending team to\
      \ defend this objective and harder for the attackers to stay close to the valve.\
      \ When the valve is opened the tank will fill up and both teams can enjoy a\
      \ live performance of The Bush Boys to celebrate the attackers' victory.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> This objective is slightly easier to defend, since the walkway itself\
      \ is another chokepoint. Rockets and shock combo's will either throw the attackers\
      \ off of the walkway, or kill them instantly. A good shot of the Bio Rifle's\
      \ alt-fire also ought to stall the attackers a bit.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      <dd> The vehicles are all-important for the outside-objectives. Both Goliaths\
      \ and the SPMA should be well-protected at all times. The SPMA can be particularly\
      \ crucial when trying to destroy the billboards. The Redeemer in the lake can\
      \ be very handy for destroying the Gate Locks in 1 shot. Once inside the factory\
      \ both teams can try to get on top of the piles of Zero Beer to surprise their\
      \ opponents. Swift movement is probably the attacker's best weapon here, especially\
      \ since 2 of the 3 final objectives take only a few seconds to reach. Also keep\
      \ an eye out for the Shield Pack and UDamage even later on, as they might respawn\
      \ in time to still be of good use. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Defensive </dt>\n<dd>\
      \ A few of the objectives are hard to near-impossible to defend (such as #1,\
      \ #3 and #8). This, however, gives the defending team the chance to gear up\
      \ and, maybe more importantly, take the time to get to a few valuable pickups.\
      \ The defending team can snatch quite a few of these items before the attacking\
      \ teams reaches them. An example is the Redeemer in the lake with the Super\
      \ Shield Pack and Keg O'Health nearby. When a defender dies during the 2nd objective\
      \ he will respawn very close to these pickups. Not only do these pickups give\
      \ the defender an advantage during the 2nd objective, but it also could give\
      \ the attackers a disadvantage in the 3rd objective when they spawn without\
      \ the pickups. The same can be done with the UDamage in the brewery. </dd></dl>\n\

      \  = Assault\n}}\n\n==Map Description==\nThis gimmicky map is set in the Australian\
      \ desert, where the local population wants to get rid of the non-alcoholic \"\
      Zero Beer\" and replace it with ordinary beer. The first 4 objectives are outside\
      \ where the attacking team must either open/close a valve or destroy a set of\
      \ targets using a set of vehicles. The rest of the mission takes place inside\
      \ the brewery where more valves have to be opened in its 2 main halls.\n\n==Objectives==\n\
      ;Destroy the Pub's Zero Beer Drainage Valve\n: The attackers start inside the\
      \ pub and must close a valve outside of the pub to stop the flow of Zero Beer\
      \ to the pub. When exiting the pub the valve can be found on the right, just\
      \ next to the pub. The defending team spawns on the other side of the large\
      \ clearing, making it an easy job for the attackers to turn the valve. This\
      \ objective should only take a few seconds. When the objective is completed\
      \ the attackers will be rewarded with a [[Scorpion]], 2 [[Hellbender]]s, an\
      \ [[SPMA]] and a [[Goliath]].\n\n: As mentioned before: The defending team spawns\
      \ on the other side of a large clearing. They do get a [[Lightning Gun]] in\
      \ their weapon loadout, but even then only a very skilled or very lucky team\
      \ of snipers will be able to stall the attackers here.\n\n;Stop the Zero Beer\
      \ Marketing Campaign\n: Now the attacking team must destroy a set of 5 billboards\
      \ promoting Zero Beer. The first 3 can be found on or near the clearing, and\
      \ should be easy to destroy with the help of the various vehicles. The 2 other\
      \ billboards, however, are placed along the road leading to the brewery and\
      \ will take more time to destroy. The vehicles (especially the Goliath and SPMA)\
      \ are crucial for this objective. Attackers who are left walking can pick up\
      \ a [[Armor#Unreal Tournament 2003 and 2004|Super Shield pack]] and a [[Health#Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2003 and 2004|Big Keg O' Health]] on the cricket field on the left\
      \ of the clearing. The SPMA enables the attackers to destroy the billboards\
      \ without having to go through the canyon, although it may take longer.\n\n\
      : The first 2-3 of the billboards are hard to defend, as the attackers can destroy\
      \ them from a long distance using the Goliath and SPMA. The defenders do have\
      \ an [[AVRiL]] to help fight the vehicles and 2 [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Minigun\
      \ Turrets]] to fight the attackers on foot. These are all located near the defenders'\
      \ first spawnpoints. When the attacking team has completed the first objective\
      \ the defenders respawn at the other end of the road, near the last billboard,\
      \ after dying. There they can use 2 [[Manta]]'s, a [[Raptor]] and a [[Cicada]].\
      \ When the defending team needs more vehicles to help in their defense, they\
      \ can choose to press Q (by default) to respawn next to this set of vehicles.\
      \ When needed they can also pick up a [[UDamage]] along the way.  \n\n;Pump\
      \ the Fresh Water to the Brewery\n: After completing the previous objective\
      \ both teams respawn. The situation and objective are similar to the first objective.\
      \ The attacking team spawns near a lake, where they must open a valve. The defending\
      \ team spawns on the other side of the canyon, near the brewery, making this\
      \ objective as easy and quick as the first one. After the valve has been opened\
      \ another Scorpion and 2 Hellbenders will spawn at the start of the road to\
      \ the next objective and a Goliath will spawn next to the lake, opposite to\
      \ the large red Zero Beer sign. Another Keg O' Health and Super Shield Pack\
      \ can be found next to this tank.\n\n: Since the defending team is spawned so\
      \ far away, they'd have to be very quick and lucky to stall the attackers. This\
      \ time is probably best spent gearing up for the next objective.\n\n;Destroy\
      \ the Brewery Gate Locks\n: With these new vehicles the attacking team must\
      \ make their way through a canyon and destroy 2 Gate Locks that lock the Main\
      \ Gate to the Brewery. There are 2 routes leading from the lake, right next\
      \ to each other. The high road leads to a vantage point for snipers, with a\
      \ clear view on the Gate Locks. Players using vehicles will have to follow the\
      \ pipeline to get to the gate. 1 shot from the Goliath's main cannon is enough\
      \ to destroy a lock, so 3 shots should complete this objective. Another tactic\
      \ the attackers can use is using the alt-fire of the [[Redeemer]] (which can\
      \ be found in the middle of the lake) to guide a rocket to the Gate Locks and\
      \ destroy all 3 of them at once. \n\n: The defending team has plenty of recourses\
      \ to help them in this fight. Not only are there 3 Minigun Turrets, but the\
      \ defending team also has 2 Scorpions and a [[Paladin]]. The Paladin's alt-fire\
      \ can be used to shield the gate locks. The vehicles from the previous objective\
      \ can still be used, but the defenders will have to drive through the attacker's\
      \ base to reach them. However, the Cicada and Raptor also enable the defenders\
      \ to reach any place in the map quickly. They could even go to the brewery and\
      \ snatch the UDamage there. It may take a while, but with the little means they\
      \ have to fend off the Goliath, it might be well worth it.\n\n;Open the Brew\
      \ Tank Water Valve\n: Now the attackers will respawn near the gates, outside\
      \ of the brewery where the remaining 5 objectives are located. The entrance\
      \ to the brewery is on the left, where the attackers will find 2 weapon lockers\
      \ and some \"Healthmite\". The valve is placed inside the brewery, against the\
      \ left wall, behind the large group of boxes. Attackers can also double-jump\
      \ onto the forklift and then onto the pile of boxes to reach the objective quicker.\n\
      \n: There are plenty of useful pickups hidden between the piles of boxes, such\
      \ as a UDamage and a Shield pack. Since the defenders spawn closer to the objective\
      \ than the attackers they will likely walk away with the pickups, giving them\
      \ a slight advantage in 1-on-1 combat. There's also another forklift that can\
      \ take the defenders on top of the piles of boxes, which can help them ambush\
      \ the attackers. Another tool that's very useful for an ambush is the [[Bio-Rifle]]\
      \ in the weapon loadout. There's also a Keg O'Health and a Super Shield Pack\
      \ near the huge tanks near the defenders' spawnpoints, outside of the brewery.\
      \ Last but not least the defenders can also use a Redeemer that's on top of\
      \ the pile of boxes near the 2nd forklift (the moving one).\n\n;Find and Deliver\
      \ the missing Hops Canisters\n: The missing Hops Canister can be found further\
      \ down the hall, on the left side in between 2 large boiler tanks. Most of the\
      \ defenders will be waiting in this area, either on the conveyor belt to the\
      \ right or near the door up ahead. If any member of the attacking team walks\
      \ over the Hops Canister the objective is completed.\n\n;Insert the Hops Canister\
      \ into the Addition Module\n: The Canister must now be carried to the Addition\
      \ Module, which is located in the next hall. There are 2 opened doors in the\
      \ back of the hall. The door on the left leads to the objective, while the door\
      \ on the right will lead to the defending team's spawnpoints and a quick death\
      \ by their [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Sentinels]]. Attackers must turn\
      \ right after entering the next hall. There the attackers can either double-jump\
      \ over the conveyor belt or take the stairs. The Addition Module is on the right\
      \ wall behind a set of 2 large tanks. When the carrier of the Hops Canister\
      \ reaches the Module the objective is completed. If the carrier dies along the\
      \ way another attacker can pick up the Canister from his/her corpse and continue\
      \ the journey to the objective.\n\n: This route features a series of narrow\
      \ passages, such as the door to the 2nd hall and the stairs over the conveyor\
      \ belt. These passages make excellent chokepoints and the defending team would\
      \ be wise to focus their attention on these passages. The Bio-Rifle, [[Shock\
      \ Rifle]] and [[Rocket Launcher]] are the most valuable weapons for this kind\
      \ of defense.\n\n;Activate the Brew Kettles\n: This is another quick objective.\
      \ The switch to activate the Brew Kettles is located on the wall opposite to\
      \ the previous objective. Not only does it take only a few seconds to get there\
      \ from the previous objective, it's also completed instantly when any member\
      \ of the attacking team is near it. When 2 attackers have made it into the hall\
      \ they can thus complete 2 objectives almost simultaneously. \n\n: Because this\
      \ objective is reached almost instantly, it's very hard to defend. Any attacker\
      \ can just jump over the conveyor, dodge-jump to the switch and complete the\
      \ objective. The best that the defenders can do is to use the tactics described\
      \ in the previous objective and prevent any attacker from walking through the\
      \ doorway. \n\n;Get the New Beer into the Fermentation Tanks\n: There's just\
      \ one more valve that has to be opened now. Further down the hall one will find\
      \ 3 large tanks on the left (all inserted in the ground) with a walkway hovering\
      \ over them. The valve is on the end of this walkway and the stair leading to\
      \ it is next to a tank, next to the switch for the Brew Kettles. The walkway\
      \ itself is narrow and exposed to enemy fire. This makes it easier for the defending\
      \ team to defend this objective and harder for the attackers to stay close to\
      \ the valve. When the valve is opened the tank will fill up and both teams can\
      \ enjoy a live performance of The Bush Boys to celebrate the attackers' victory.\n\
      \n: This objective is slightly easier to defend, since the walkway itself is\
      \ another chokepoint. Rockets and shock combo's will either throw the attackers\
      \ off of the walkway, or kill them instantly. A good shot of the Bio Rifle's\

      ** 6x Floor Sentinels\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n;Offensive\n: The vehicles are all-important\
      \ for the outside-objectives. Both Goliaths and the SPMA should be well-protected\
      \ at all times. The SPMA can be particularly crucial when trying to destroy\
      \ the billboards. The Redeemer in the lake can be very handy for destroying\
      \ the Gate Locks in 1 shot. Once inside the factory both teams can try to get\
      \ on top of the piles of Zero Beer to surprise their opponents. Swift movement\
      \ is probably the attacker's best weapon here, especially since 2 of the 3 final\
      \ objectives take only a few seconds to reach. Also keep an eye out for the\
      \ Shield Pack and UDamage even later on, as they might respawn in time to still\
      \ be of good use. \n\n;Defensive \n: A few of the objectives are hard to near-impossible\
      \ to defend (such as #1, #3 and #8). This, however, gives the defending team\
      \ the chance to gear up and, maybe more importantly, take the time to get to\
      \ a few valuable pickups. The defending team can snatch quite a few of these\
      \ items before the attacking teams reaches them. An example is the Redeemer\
      \ in the lake with the Super Shield Pack and Keg O'Health nearby. When a defender\
      \ dies during the 2nd objective he will respawn very close to these pickups.\
      \ Not only do these pickups give the defender an advantage during the 2nd objective,\
      \ but it also could give the attackers a disadvantage in the 3rd objective when\
      \ they spawn without the pickups. The same can be done with the UDamage in the\
      \ brewery. \n\n==Trivia==\n* AS-Outback won the 3rd prize in the \"Best Assault\
      \ Level\" category in Phase IV of the Make Something Unreal Contest\n* The fire\
      \ extinguishers in the brewery will explode when shot at, though it doesn't\
      \ do any damage.\n* The pictures on the walls in the pub include a few of the\
      \ author's friends (such as King Mango and SuperApe) as well as himself.\n*\
      \ Near the entrance of the brewery a large picture is hanging on the wall, portraying\
      \ [[CliffyB]] as the \"Employee of the Month\".\n\n{{Navbox maps|game=UT2004|gametype=Assault}}\n\
