      \ of UT2004 bots, but some may apply to other UT games.</i></dd></dl>\n<p>Bots\
      \ are often disliked due to their very un-humanlike behavior, particularly bots\
      \ of the Adept skill level and above. They have extremely good aim with weapons\
      \ such as the <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>,\
      \ <a href=\"/Minigun\" title=\"Minigun\">Minigun</a>, and the <a href=\"/Link_Gun\"\
      \ title=\"Link Gun\">link beam</a> at close range. At the same time, their aim\
      \ can be quite lacking with other weapons.  For instance, if a player goes anywhere\
      \ near a Godlike bot with the flak cannon or link gun, they will almost certainly\
      \ die, or at least suffer massive damage.\n</p><p>Bots can also do things that\
      \ are <i>technically impossible</i> for real players. For instance, real players\
      \ must wait a short amount of time (roughly half a second) after <a href=\"\
      /Dodging\" title=\"Dodging\">dodging</a> before they are able to dodge again.\
      \ Bots, on the other hand, can dodge immediately after landing. They also react\
      \ instantly to a projectiles such as a <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"\
      Rocket Launcher\">rocket</a> or <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"Shock Rifle\"\
      >shock core</a> being fired at them.\n</p><p>Even though bots display superhuman\
      \ aim and impossible movement, they are also incredibly predictable. With a\
      \ little practice, even a moderately skilled UT2004 player can defeat a Godlike\
      \ bot in a <a href=\"/1v1\" title=\"1v1\">1v1</a> duel, or even a small <a href=\"\
      /FFA\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"FFA\">FFA</a> match.\n</p><p>Technical\
      \ details are a bit sketchy, but there's a basic overlay about bot capabilities\
      \ at various levels:\n</p>\n<ul><li> Novice: 60% movement speed, won't move\
      \ during combat, 30° field of view, aim can go up to 30° off target, turns less\
      \ than 180° per second.</li>\n<li> Average: 70% speed, little better accuracy,\
      \ turns a bit more than 180° per second.</li>\n<li> Experienced: 80% speed,\
      \ uses Translocator, strafes during combat, 40° field of view, turns more than\
      \ 180° per second.</li>\n<li> Skilled: 90% speed, can double jump, field of\
      \ view 60°, turns approx. 225° per second.</li>\n<li> Adept: full speed, tries\
      \ to dodge incoming fire, tries to get closer during combat, if using non-hitscan\
      \ weapon then \"leads\" aiming, field of view 80°, turns nearly 270° per second.</li>\n\
      <li> Masterful: uses Impact Hammer to jump higher, uses shock combo, changes\
      \ target during combat, in Onslaught it will repair powernodes before leaving,\
      \ field of view 100°, turns approx. 315° per second. This is as close as it\
      \ can get to a real human opponent - higher skill bots are considered bots that\
      \ cheat.</li>\n<li> Inhuman: tries to dodge enemy aim, field of view 120° without\
      \ distance limits, bails out if an incoming AVRiL will destroy the vehicle,\
      \ turns around in less than one second.</li>\n<li> Godlike: aim goes less than\
      \ 1° off target, 360° field of view without line of sight limitations (meaning\
      \ it sees the whole map at all times), turns around in less than 0.5 seconds.</li></ul>\n\
      <p><br />\nBots move around the map using a pathnode network placed by the map's\
      \ creator in UnrealEd. They first decide their current objective; if it is not\
      \ a pathnode itself (items and flags are), then they find the nearest node.\
      \ Next they find the node nearest to themselves, then extrapolate the shortest\
      \ route along the network, making a beeline from node to node until the objective.\
      \ Bots do not actively hunt the player at first, but prefer to go around the\
      \ map and collect items until the player wanders into their line of sight, at\
      \ which point the bot begins combat. If a bot was hurt or killed by another\
      \ bot or the player, it will sometimes actively go for revenge as their immediate\
      \ goal, killing the offenders in the order they attacked it. If a player runs\
      \ away, the bot may follow for a short time then return to it's previous activity.\n\
      </p><p>Bots automatically assume spawnpoints and item positions as safe. If\
      \ a bot calls for help and/or another volunteers, then a squad is formed. The\
      \ leader moves and behaves normally while the others follow it no matter what.\
      \ They may go for a short distance away to collect another weapon or engage\
      \ an enemy but they will immediately return; in short, followers can still do\
      \ everything normally but they won't if the leader's actions conflict it (for\
      \ example, it won't go home and defend the flag if the leader is running towards\
      \ the enemy base).\n</p><p>Sometimes bots can get stuck: they try to achieve\
      \ something and if they are unsuccessful, they try again, <i>ad infinitum</i>.\
      \ This is often caused by problematic pathing: the node network says they can\
      \ do it but in reality they can't (for example, map geometry is obstructing\
      \ the path or they are trying to jump to a ledge only accessible via translocator).\n\
      </p><p>Bot behavior can be studied by using the Mind Reader mutator (UT only,\
      \ available <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.uncommonplace.com/games/mindreader.html\"\
      >here</a>) or the ShowDebug console command for UT2003/2004, both while spectating\
