      <p>Lauren was born from a poor asteroid miner family. In her youth she eradicated\
      \ her parents competitors and learned the skills to become a <a href=\"/Liandri_Grand_Tournament\"\
      \ title=\"Liandri Grand Tournament\">Tournament</a> competitor. Lauren won one\
      \ of the tournaments and became champion, although it is unknown exactly when\
      \ this happened.\n</p><p>Lauren was said to be the lover of <a href=\"/Iron_Guard#Jihan_Nyhn\"\
      \ title=\"Iron Guard\">Jihan Nyhn</a>, a powerful arms smuggler. Jihan was assassinated,\
      \ and Lauren expected the <a href=\"/Liandri_Mining_Corporation\" title=\"Liandri\
      \ Mining Corporation\">Liandri Mining Corporation</a> to be behind it. Hoping\
      \ to uncover the truth, she joined the <a href=\"/Iron_Guard\" title=\"Iron\

      \ Tournament after the assassination. (<a href=\"/UT\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\

      \ series are set in the same timeline/reality as the \"Unreal Tournament\" series.\
      \ The reason for this is that it would be unlikely that Brock could be killed\
      \ by Gorge considering the <a href=\"/Respawner\" title=\"Respawner\">Respawner</a>\
      \ technology, not to mention that if they would die in 2302, how could've they\
      \ fought in the 2303 Tournament, leading their old team? Among other things,\
      \ this would mean Necris Lauren is an alterate version.\n</p><p>Epic considers\
      \ the UC games part of the Unreal series as a whole. Respawners are used in\
      \ all regular <a href=\"/Liandri_Grand_Tournament\" title=\"Liandri Grand Tournament\"\
      >Tournaments</a>, but not usually outside of them, as can be learned from an\
      \ early <a href=\"/UT3\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UT3\">UT3</a> movie,\
      \ and Brock was killed outside of the Tournament.\n</p><p>Further speculation\
      \ lead to the confusion of when Brock was killed. It is described in UC2 that\
      \ Gorge won the Tournament by breaking Malcom's spine, angering Brock in the\
      \ process who later got killed by Gorge. The players speculate how this is possible,\
      \ because it is described in the Tournament mode in UT2004 that Malcom still\
      \ suffer some injuries (probably his spine), yet... Brock and Lauren is healthy,\
      \ and very human...\n</p><p>Some fans also speculate if Brock's amnesia might\
      \ be the cause of some sort of Necris plot to make Brock their own. Lauren might\
      \ have lost some sanity trying to fight the mind control, that, or she's just\
      \ angered because of Brock's amnesia. Fans also questions why Lauren (whom retains\
      \ her memories) has'nt rejoined Iron Guard, and why she keeps being dressed\
      \ up in Necris uniform, despite hating them. (Like in UT3)\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      \ took her life after her boyfriend and teammate [[Brock]] died. The [[Liandri\
      \ Mining Corporation|Liandri]] could not afford to lose two popular competitors\
      \ at once, so they resurrected her with the horrific - and horrifically expensive\
      \ - [[Necris]] process. One side effect: Lauren is only marginally sane. She\
      \ does her best to share her demented grief with others.|[[UC2]] character description}}\n\
      \nLauren was born from a poor asteroid miner family. In her youth she eradicated\
      \ her parents competitors and learned the skills to become a [[Liandri Grand\
      \ Tournament|Tournament]] competitor. Lauren won one of the tournaments and\
      \ became champion, although it is unknown exactly when this happened.\n\nLauren\
      \ was said to be the lover of [[Iron Guard#Jihan Nyhn|Jihan Nyhn]], a powerful\
      \ arms smuggler. Jihan was assassinated, and Lauren expected the [[Liandri Mining\
      \ Corporation]] to be behind it. Hoping to uncover the truth, she joined the\
      \ [[Iron Guard]], Jihan's team of personal bodyguards who entered Liandri's\
      \ Tournament after the assassination. ([[UT]]).\n\nLauren was the girlfriend\
      \ of team member [[Brock]], though different sources give different explanations\
      \ to how they met. It is possible she met Brock after losing Jihan Nyhn and\
      \ joining the Iron Guard. Another source claims Lauren and Brock were high-school\
      \ sweethearts ([[UT2003]], [[UT2004]]).\n\nDuring 2302's Tournament ([[UT2003]]),\
      \ Brock fought alongside Tournament champion [[Malcolm]] and gained much respect\
      \ for him. After Malcolm was defeated by the [[Juggernauts|Juggernaut]] [[Gorge]],\
      \ Brock foolishly tried to avenge Malcolm by ambushing Gorge. Gorge quickly\
      \ reacted and killed Brock. Wrought with grief, [[Lauren]] took her own life\
      \ on Asteroid 35332-XA.\n\n==Lauren's Death==\nAfter her death, the [[Liandri\
      \ Mining Corporation]] paid the [[Phayder Corporation]] an huge amount of money\
      \ to have Lauren resurrected as [[Necris]], effectively turning her into Liandri\
      \ property. The process caused her to remain only marginally sane. Brock was\
      \ also resurrected, but he lost all memories of his previous life. Brock and\
      \ Lauren didn't get back together.\n\nAs a Necris, she has fought in the 523rd\
      \ [[Ascension Rites|Nakhti Ascension Rights]], armed with her new signature\
      \ weapon, the Necris Swords ([[UC2]]).\n\n==Alternate reality?==\nSome fans\
      \ speculate whether or not the \"Unreal Championship\" series are set in the\
      \ same timeline/reality as the \"Unreal Tournament\" series. The reason for\
      \ this is that it would be unlikely that Brock could be killed by Gorge considering\
      \ the [[Respawner]] technology, not to mention that if they would die in 2302,\
      \ how could've they fought in the 2303 Tournament, leading their old team? Among\
      \ other things, this would mean Necris Lauren is an alterate version.\n\nEpic\
      \ considers the UC games part of the Unreal series as a whole. Respawners are\
      \ used in all regular [[Liandri Grand Tournament|Tournaments]], but not usually\
      \ outside of them, as can be learned from an early [[UT3]] movie, and Brock\
      \ was killed outside of the Tournament.\n\nFurther speculation lead to the confusion\
      \ of when Brock was killed. It is described in UC2 that Gorge won the Tournament\
      \ by breaking Malcom's spine, angering Brock in the process who later got killed\
      \ by Gorge. The players speculate how this is possible, because it is described\
      \ in the Tournament mode in UT2004 that Malcom still suffer some injuries (probably\
      \ his spine), yet... Brock and Lauren is healthy, and very human...\n\nSome\
      \ fans also speculate if Brock's amnesia might be the cause of some sort of\
      \ Necris plot to make Brock their own. Lauren might have lost some sanity trying\
      \ to fight the mind control, that, or she's just angered because of Brock's\
      \ amnesia. Fans also questions why Lauren (whom retains her memories) has'nt\
      \ rejoined Iron Guard, and why she keeps being dressed up in Necris uniform,\
      \ despite hating them. (Like in UT3)\n\n== Trivia ==\n* In [[Unreal Championship\
      \ 2]], Tanika Cato, her voice actress, performed double duty as both Lauren\
      \ and Sapphire.\n* In [[Unreal Tournament 3]], she's voiced by Sirena Irwin,\
      \ who also voiced Persephone Cliche in the Stripperella cartoon.\n\n==Links==\n\
