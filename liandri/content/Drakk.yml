      \ space is unknown. They are only seen in Unreal 2 in two missions on two planets:\
      \ <a href=\"/edit/Na_Koja_Abad?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Na Koja Abad\
      \ (page does not exist)\">Na Koja Abad</a>, where they established a small defensive\
      \ force around one of the Artifacts. Their primary world, or the homeworld,\
      \ seems to be <a href=\"/edit/NC962VII?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"NC962VII\
      \ (page does not exist)\">NC962VII</a>. There are probably other planets that\
      \ have been inhabited by the Drakk.\n</p><p>The Drakk were originally biological\
      \ creatures. Unfortunately for them, they created such a high technology that\
      \ it decided that their makers were more of a problem than help and destroyed\
      \ all of the biological Drakk. Some Drakk might have turned cybernetic themselves.\
      \ As the Drakk as machines needed repairs, they invented the Drakk Droids that\
      \ primarily fixes broken Drakk. The Droids are well-protected as the Drakk can't\
      \ let all of the repair droids be destroyed. If that happens, though, the Droids\
      \ are regenerated by their own pods.\n</p><p>Since the cybernetic revolution,\
      \ the Drakk terraformed their home planet and changed almost everything to look\
      \ cybernetic, plastic or metal. They seem to like cyan, dark blue and black\
      \ colors, while red is used to mark blocked entrances. High levels of radiation\
      \ is found in their territories; the Drakk also tend to create statics that\
      \ block radio signals - either by purpose or that is a form of their own communication.\n\
      </p><p>The Drakk are known for their ultra-modern technologies. They use the\
      \ innovative laser technology that is not usually used anywhere else and is\
      \ highly effective, accompanied by the incendiary plasma usage. They are first\
      \ seen using <a href=\"/Laser_trip_mine\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Laser\
      \ trip mine\">laser trip mines</a>, on Na Koja Abad. The Drakk have pods that\
      \ regenerate Drakk drones from scratch and containers that keep spare body parts\
      \ alive. The Drakk also have some kind of an anti-gravity technology that lets\
      \ them fly or levitate and helps to get to the higher parts of the world. In\
      \ their worlds, everything is usually automated and doesn't need any attention,\
      \ so Drakk usually rest in their pods. They extensively use electricity for\
      \ all kinds of processes, although the source of it is not known.\n</p>\n<h2><span\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Like most of the sapient creatures in Unreal 2, the\
      \ Drakk have three classes: Light, Medium and Heavy as well as the non-aggressive\
      \ Droids. Light Drakk are sometimes unofficially called Soldiers, Medium - Overlords,\
      \ and the Heavy Drakk in the code are called Drakk Bosses.\n</p><p>Light Drakk\
      \ are seen on both <a href=\"/edit/Na_Koja_Abad?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"\
      Na Koja Abad (page does not exist)\">Na Koja Abad</a> and <a href=\"/edit/NC962VII?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"NC962VII (page does not exist)\">NC962VII</a>, though\
      \ on Na Koja Abad they are the primary opponents. They are small and fast creatures\
      \ that use their tentacles to grab the prey and electrify them. They have 400\
      \ health and tend to float around and dodge a lot. <a href=\"/Hitscan\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Hitscan\">Hitscan</a> weapons are recommended against\
      \ them. Their electrical attack is not too dangerous though and they shouldn't\
      \ be much of a threat - more a creature that eats a lot of your ammo.\n</p><p>Medium\
      \ Drakk are primarily seen on NC962VII, but there is a strong one that was used\
      \ as a boss creature on Na Koja Abad. They usually have 800 health and are bigger\
      \ thus easier to shoot. They don't fly around as much as the light ones, but\
      \ they levitate. Medium Drakk use the Drakk laser technology to defend, and\
      \ probably for offense as well. They use blue laser to trace the targets while\
      \ charging the primary laser. Don't wait if you see one pointing at you. The\
      \ Medium Drakk usually live in odd pods that are usually in the ground and opens\
      \ when the Overlord wishes to leave. Inside the pods you can find strange liquid\
      \ that is very unhealthy for humans. There are usually more Medium Drakk than\
      \ any of the other types of them.\n</p><p>The Heavy Drakk, or the Drakk Boss,\
      \ is only seen once on NC962VII, but there probably are more on other planets\
      \ of even the same one. It is not really a single cybernetic creature - it can\
      \ disassemble to two different parts. They are called the Upper and the Lower\
      \ parts of the Drakk Boss. All of them can fly. The Boss usually fights in the\
      \ full form until is damaged enough to change tactics. This form uses a weak\
      \ version of the Drakk lasers - they deal only 10 damage, but it is compensated\
      \ by rapid fire. The full Drakk Boss can charge up to 8 lasers at a time and\
      \ fire pretty much like the <a href=\"/Cicada\" title=\"Cicada\">Cicada</a>'s\
      \ alternative fire. The lasers get damaged and eventually - inoperational, when\
      \ an amount of damage is dealt by the player. When all of the lasers fail, the\
      \ Drakk Boss disassembles and the upper part files away while the lower part\
      \ tries to hide. The top part has 6000 health and is equipped with a plasma\
      \ spray, looking just like the <a href=\"/Laser_Rifle\" title=\"Laser Rifle\"\
      >Laser Rifle</a>'s alternative fire. It deals a lot less damage though, and\
      \ seems not to have the incendiary effect. The upper part of the boss attacks\
      \ with the plasma spray forming a whip-shaped stream of it that is very hard\
      \ to avoid. The best way to do that would be simply hiding, but this attack\
      \ isn't too tough. When the upper part of the Drakk Boss is destroyed, the lower\
      \ part tries to regenerate the upper part. If the top part is not destroyed\
      \ even after a long time after the start of the battle, it goes into kamikaze\
      \ mode and explodes when it hits something - that way the lower part regenerates\
      \ the upper one ever more swiftly. If the player gets close enough to the lower\
      \ part, it can use a weak electrical attack pretty much like the Light Drakk\
      \ do, but they prefer hiding. When the lower part regenerates the upper one,\
      \ the Drakk Boss gets full again and everything starts over. When the lower\
      \ part, having 4000 health, is destroyed, it starts spinning and after a while\
      \ explodes, dealing no damage.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ 2, awakening when the protagonist tries to escape with one part of it; another\
      \ Artifact is stored in the heavily defended center of the Drakk homeworld.\n\
      \n== History and technology ==\n\n[[Image:DrakkGenerator.png|right|thumb|300px|A\
      \ Drakk anti-gravity field generator.]]\nThe actual Drakk population and populated\
      \ space is unknown. They are only seen in Unreal 2 in two missions on two planets:\
      \ [[Na Koja Abad]], where they established a small defensive force around one\
      \ of the Artifacts. Their primary world, or the homeworld, seems to be [[NC962VII]].\
      \ There are probably other planets that have been inhabited by the Drakk.\n\n\
      The Drakk were originally biological creatures. Unfortunately for them, they\
      \ created such a high technology that it decided that their makers were more\

      \ If that happens, though, the Droids are regenerated by their own pods.\n\n\
      Since the cybernetic revolution, the Drakk terraformed their home planet and\
      \ changed almost everything to look cybernetic, plastic or metal. They seem\

      \ not usually used anywhere else and is highly effective, accompanied by the\

      \ as well as the non-aggressive Droids. Light Drakk are sometimes unofficially\
      \ called Soldiers, Medium - Overlords, and the Heavy Drakk in the code are called\
      \ Drakk Bosses.\n\nLight Drakk are seen on both [[Na Koja Abad]] and [[NC962VII]],\
      \ though on Na Koja Abad they are the primary opponents. They are small and\
      \ fast creatures that use their tentacles to grab the prey and electrify them.\
      \ They have 400 health and tend to float around and dodge a lot. [[Hitscan]]\
      \ weapons are recommended against them. Their electrical attack is not too dangerous\
      \ though and they shouldn't be much of a threat - more a creature that eats\
      \ a lot of your ammo.\n\nMedium Drakk are primarily seen on NC962VII, but there\
      \ is a strong one that was used as a boss creature on Na Koja Abad. They usually\
      \ have 800 health and are bigger thus easier to shoot. They don't fly around\
      \ as much as the light ones, but they levitate. Medium Drakk use the Drakk laser\
      \ technology to defend, and probably for offense as well. They use blue laser\
      \ to trace the targets while charging the primary laser. Don't wait if you see\

      \ you can find strange liquid that is very unhealthy for humans. There are usually\
      \ more Medium Drakk than any of the other types of them.\n\nThe Heavy Drakk,\
      \ or the Drakk Boss, is only seen once on NC962VII, but there probably are more\
      \ on other planets of even the same one. It is not really a single cybernetic\
      \ creature - it can disassemble to two different parts. They are called the\
      \ Upper and the Lower parts of the Drakk Boss. All of them can fly. The Boss\
      \ usually fights in the full form until is damaged enough to change tactics.\
      \ This form uses a weak version of the Drakk lasers - they deal only 10 damage,\
      \ but it is compensated by rapid fire. The full Drakk Boss can charge up to\
      \ 8 lasers at a time and fire pretty much like the [[Cicada]]'s alternative\
      \ fire. The lasers get damaged and eventually - inoperational, when an amount\
      \ of damage is dealt by the player. When all of the lasers fail, the Drakk Boss\
      \ disassembles and the upper part files away while the lower part tries to hide.\
      \ The top part has 6000 health and is equipped with a plasma spray, looking\
      \ just like the [[Laser Rifle]]'s alternative fire. It deals a lot less damage\
      \ though, and seems not to have the incendiary effect. The upper part of the\
      \ boss attacks with the plasma spray forming a whip-shaped stream of it that\
      \ is very hard to avoid. The best way to do that would be simply hiding, but\
      \ this attack isn't too tough. When the upper part of the Drakk Boss is destroyed,\
      \ the lower part tries to regenerate the upper part. If the top part is not\
      \ destroyed even after a long time after the start of the battle, it goes into\
      \ kamikaze mode and explodes when it hits something - that way the lower part\
      \ regenerates the upper one ever more swiftly. If the player gets close enough\
      \ to the lower part, it can use a weak electrical attack pretty much like the\
      \ Light Drakk do, but they prefer hiding. When the lower part regenerates the\
      \ upper one, the Drakk Boss gets full again and everything starts over. When\
      \ the lower part, having 4000 health, is destroyed, it starts spinning and after\
      \ a while explodes, dealing no damage.\n\n== Experimentation ==\n\nThe Drakk\
      \ are known to like experimenting with other creatures in order to create another\
      \ creature that would have all of the best properties of each race used. The\
      \ creatures that are being experimented on usually include lost creatures of\
      \ expeditions to the Drakk homeworld, such as humans, Skaarj and [[Izarians]].\
      \ The experiments are held in hermetical containers full of some kind of a liquid\
      \ that keeps the parts of the experiment bodies alive. Experiments that are\
      \ more successful and can live without the need of this container are put into\
      \ Sinister Orbs that Drakk use to test the experiments' abilities by using shock\
      \ therapy. The excessive usage of the Orb is known to have very negative effects\
      \ on the experiments though.\n\nDuring his stay on NC962VII, [[John Dalton]]\
      \ nicely described this experimentation:\n{{QuoteSource|What is this, some kind\
      \ of a freak show?!|John Dalton|John Dalton}}\n\n== Trivia ==\n*One of the [[Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2003]] and later - [[UT2004]] maps, [[DM-Insidious]], features\
      \ two Drakk experiment containers. One of them is empty, and in the other one\
      \ you can see a half of a Tournament watcher. Similarly to the ones in Unreal\
      \ 2, the body starts moving when players get close to the container.\n*The Drakk\
      \ Boss is flying so it requires a special type of [[Unreal:PathNode|PathNodes]]\
      \ that wouldn't open the debug dialog that would complain about the node being\
      \ in the air. The new PathNodes were called [[Unreal:FlyingPathNode|FlyingPathNodes]]\
      \ and are drawn as PathNodes (apples) with wings. They were absent from [[Unreal\
      \ Tournament 2003]] and later, since [[Unreal Tournament 2004]], they re-appeared\
      \ with a new design (a realistic apple and less like a peach) and started to\
      \ be used for marking the paths of flying [[:Category:Vehicles|vehicles]].\n\
