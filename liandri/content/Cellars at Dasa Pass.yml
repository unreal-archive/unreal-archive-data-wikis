      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Now within the Dasa cellars, you face a long slog through these subterranean\
      \ halls, corridors and rooms. Some of these extensive cellars are flooded and\
      \ all of them are extensively populated by the Skaarj and their minions; the\
      \ journey will not be an easy one.\n</p><p>You start just beyond the door you\
      \ came through at the end of the previous level. You are in a tall circular\
      \ chamber with a pillar at the centre and exits at the back and on the left.\n\
      </p><p>Go anticlockwise round the pillar, killing a <a href=\"/Tentacle\" title=\"\
      Tentacle\">Tentacle</a> that snipes from a recess in the ceiling near the back,\
      \ then arriving at the back of the room where you can collect an <a href=\"\
      /Enforcer\" title=\"Enforcer\">Automag</a>. The back exit leads to another room\
      \ but it is barred - kill at this point the two KrallElites who shoot between\
      \ the bars from the room beyond.\n</p><p>You can't go through this exit yet,\
      \ so go on round to the side exit. Follow the corridor beyond and you go round\
      \ into a room with platforms and fallen beams over water. This room is guarded\
      \ by a trio of Krall - kill them (once again I recommend the <a href=\"/Bio_Rifle\"\
      \ title=\"Bio Rifle\">GES Biorifle</a>). When the Krall are dead, look around.\
      \ You are on the lower of the three platforms; you can climb the fallen beams\
      \ to get to the raised ones.\n</p><p>Climb first to the raised balcony on the\
      \ right. There, barrels contain a box of 8 Rifle Rounds. Go back down and climb\
      \ up on to the other raised balcony: there, containers reveal a Clip and a can\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge. There's also a winch handle up here, so turn it. You have\
      \ opened the bars on the first exit from the circular room. Before returning\
      \ though, take a dip in the water around the lower platform. This water is patrolled\
      \ by four <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a>, but if you're\
      \ playing on one of the lower skill settings they can each be gibbed in one\
      \ shot with the Power 5 <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\"\
      >Dispersion Pistol</a>.\n</p><p>Shoot the four barrels on the floor of the pool.\
      \ Two of them reveal a pair of ASMD Cores, whilst the other two contain two\
      \ boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Come up for air, then dive back down; shine a light\
      \ into the dark corner of the pool behind the pillar. You will see an entrance\
      \ a short way up from floor level on the back wall; go inside and follow the\
      \ underwater shaft beyond. Surface in the small chamber at the end; here, several\
      \ <a href=\"/Nali\" title=\"Nali\">Nali</a> corpses are guarded by two Tentacles.\
      \ When you've killed the Tentacles, you can collect a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> from\
      \ the floor here.\n</p><p>Return along the underwater shaft and climb out of\
      \ the water back on to the platform. Return down the corridor to the circular\
      \ room, then go through the newly opened exit clockwise from there. Go through\
      \ into the room beyond.\n</p><p>The room you are now in has a locked door ahead,\
      \ a balcony above, a raised alcove on the left, and a lift shaft to the balcony\
      \ in a recess on the right. Collect of the three <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\"\
      \ title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a> here, then go to the lift\
      \ shaft. As you approach the lift shaft, the lift descends to greet you. So,\
      \ step on the lift. As you do so, a <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\">Brute</a>\
      \ in the alcove will spot you and start hurling rockets at you. Dodge his rockets\
      \ until the lift rises but otherwise ignore him. At the top, step along the\
      \ stone beam and you will be on the balcony.\n</p><p>On the balcony, two Krall\
      \ will attack from either side. Kill them, then go anticlockwise round the balcony.\
      \ At the second corner, you will find an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a> behind barrels containing\
      \ a can of 12 Eightballs. At the third corner, a crate contains a box of 8 Rifle\
      \ Rounds. Then, you will come to a winch. Turn the winch and the doors at the\
      \ far end of the area below swing open. Drop down and go through the doors before\
      \ they close again. Safely installed in the next corridor, look around.\nTo\
      \ the right, some large metal grille gates bar the way to a large corridor patrolled\
      \ by a Brute. Ahead is a locked door. To the left, a small door on the left\
      \ of the corridor is open while a doorway to the right of the corridor is blocked\
      \ by bars. Go up to the far end of this stretch of corridor in that direction,\
      \ and look to the left at the corner.\n</p><p>In this stretch, a fallen beam\
      \ to the right leads up to the alcove the Brute shot from earlier. Climb the\
      \ beam and kill the Brute then collect the Clip from nearby. Return to the bottom\
      \ of the beam, then shoot out of the way the barrels that obstruct your passage\
      \ to a pair of crucified Nali over a pool of blood at the end. Put the Nali\
      \ out of their misery.\n</p><p>Before returning to the main stretch of corridor,\
      \ climb the narrow steps opposite the fallen beam and go on to the beams over\
      \ the main stretch of corridor below. Collect the <a href=\"/Ripper\" title=\"\
      Ripper\">Razorjack</a> here then drop down the gap ahead to the corridor floor\
      \ below. Then, go along in the direction away from the metal gates and take\
      \ the small open door on the left. Kill the Krall within, then open barrels\
      \ for a box of 10 Flak Shells. This room also contains a winch operated by a\
      \ lever. Activate the lever, and the two entrances on the other side of the\
      \ front corridor are opened, i.e. the bars and the doors.\n</p><p>Go through\
      \ the opened doors. On entering the corridor beyond, a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a> will dart out from a chamber on\
      \ the left. Kill him, then another SkaarjWarrior who comes down the corridor\
      \ from the far end. By the time both Skaarj are dead, the doors will have closed.\
      \ However, if you go into the chamber on the left, you will find that the bars\
      \ out to the front corridor which lead off this room have not closed and you\
      \ can still go out if you want to. You will also find two boxes of 10 Flak Shells.\n\
      </p><p>Return to the inner corridor where you fought the SkaarjWarriors. Look\
      \ along its length.\n</p><p>Explore the offshoots of this corridor. Openable\
      \ doors on the left lead only to barred corridors, while open doors on the right\
      \ are more rewarding, going into a small vault where containers reveal two Clips\
      \ and 40 Tarydium Shards, but an entrance at the back of this vault is barred\
      \ off too. Return to the corridor and go along to the junction at the end. On\
      \ the right there is an alcove where crates reveal three cans of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ Then, go along the other route from the junction. There, an entrance at the\
      \ foot of a flight of steps is also barred off. So, climb the steps.\n</p><p>The\
      \ room at the top of the sweeping staircase is a large partially open-roofed\
      \ circular room with a wide pillar in the middle. Looks innocuous enough...\
      \ but go further into the room and things will get a lot worse. A hatch wall\
      \ on the left opens to reveal an alcove out of which a virtually endless supply\
      \ of Krall emerges in twos. To make matters worse, a <a href=\"/Titan\" title=\"\
      Titan\">StoneTitan</a> is lurking behind the pillar who'll take a pretty instant\
      \ dislike to you.\n</p><p>Fortunately for you, the player, the StoneTitan hates\
      \ Krall even more than he hates you. What you need to do to get out of this\
      \ room as you are barred in, is to find and press a protruding brick on the\
      \ back of a big central pillar. This opens a section of wall that is in the\
      \ patch of light on the dark wall that is to the right as you enter. If you\
      \ can get the StoneTitan distracted by the Krall, you can avoid both parties\
      \ while you get out of the room.\n</p><p>If you do have enough ammo and do not\
      \ want to take risks (recommended for higher difficulty levels), you can kill\
      \ Titan without waking up Kralls (to make stonewall go away). Enter room just\
      \ a bit, without barricading entryway on your back. Shoot Titan and it will\
      \ follow you into corridor. You know what to do. After that, press brick and\
      \ proceed through secret door.\n</p><p>So, go for it. Enter the room and get\
      \ the StoneTitan to notice the Krall instead of you by hiding behind the pillar\
      \ while the Krall come out - you'll need to wake the Titan up yourself first.\
      \ Then, press the brick and go through the secret door into the corridor beyond.\n\
      </p><p>The secret corridor turns into a flight of spiral steps. Climb the steps\
      \ to the corridor at the top, but beware the nasty <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjAssassin</a> lying in wait along the corridor.\
      \ When the Skaarj is dead, follow the corridor round and you will come out on\
      \ a balcony above the room around the central pillar. Go to the left visiting\
      \ the two boxes of Flak Shells on the way until you can see an alcove above\
      \ the barred entrance containing a button. Run off so that you fall into this\
      \ alcove then press the button (don't jump, just run). Be careful not to be\
      \ squished by the bars over the entrance as they spring back up. When the entrance\
      \ bars are removed, go down to the floor of the room and retreat down the stairs\
      \ from the StoneTitan into safety.\n</p><p>If you are willing to brave the Titan\
      \ room again, go through the previously barred entrance that leads through the\
      \ outer wall immediately at the bottom of the flight of steps. Follow the corridor\
      \ beyond round to another pair of bars, which open as you approach, then plunge\
      \ into the water pool beyond. Follow the pool as it turns into an underwater\
      \ shaft - soon you can swim up through a grate that opens to collect four cans\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge and a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak\
      \ Cannon</a> from the floor of the cistern you are then in.\n</p><p>Swim up\
      \ the cistern and surface at the top. Climb out, and you are on the balcony\
      \ above the Titan room again. Find a safe moment and drop to the floor of the\
      \ Titan room, retreating once more down the flight of steps. If you consider\
      \ it worth the risk (I don't), you can go down via the Krall alcove and go to\
      \ the back to collect the two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards there, but either\
      \ way, escape from the room and go back down the steps.\n</p><p>Now, go along\
      \ the corridor to the junction. A new stretch of corridor has been revealed\
      \ on the left; kill the SkaarjWarrior lurking within, then go along to the end\
      \ past a pair of Nali Healing Fruit growing out of lifted sections of the floor,\
      \ pressing the lever at the end. Pressing the lever opened the bars behind the\
      \ openable doors in the inner corridor, so do an about turn and go down the\
      \ corridor across the junction, entering the first door on the right and going\
      \ through the open bars, climbing the ramp beyond. At the top, you will have\
      \ an altercation with two Krall and a beefy <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjLord</a>. Kill all three.\n</p><p>Look around\
      \ this area. You are in a ring-shaped room with a separate walled off room in\
      \ the centre; doors at either end of the walled off room are locked. At either\
      \ end of the ring-shaped room, you can collect two cans of 12 Eightballs from\
      \ behind pillars. When you've collected what you need, go to the end of the\
      \ room that was to the left as you entered.\n</p><p>At this end of the room\
      \ there is a counterweight operated by a pair of levers. Activate the levers,\
      \ then go to the far end of the ring. You will see a metal grille lift descend\
      \ with a SkaarjWarrior on it; kill the Skaarj then step aboard the lift yourself\
      \ (if necessary then call it again). Ride the lift to the top and go through\
      \ the opening there. You will come out on a high balcony above the inside of\
      \ the walled off room; look down and you will see that the walled off room is\
      \ a deep water store with a Super Health Pack inaccessible on a pillar in the\
      \ centre.\n</p><p>Go to the far end of the balcony and you will see a button.\
      \ Be sure to press it, as it raises a flight of steps around the central pillar\
      \ making the Super Health Pack accessible.\n</p><p>Drop down into the water\
      \ pool. Underwater are four <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a>;\
      \ kill the fish, then collect of the four Nali Healing Fruit in the corners\
      \ of the pool. Swim down to the bottom of the pool beneath the Super Health\
      \ Pack pillar and you will find a lever there - activate it. Turn round and\
      \ face the wall of the pool beneath the button you activated above. Shoot a\
      \ tile just below half way up on the right and it opens to reveal three 25kg\
      \ cans of Tarydium Sludge. Then, swim to the surface and climb out on to the\
      \ base of the Super Health Pack pillar.\n</p><p>Climb the steps you raised to\
      \ get the Super Health Pack, then jump off on to the walkway around the edge\
      \ of the pool. Go to either of the end doors, which are open since you pressed\
      \ the lever, and go out into the ring-shaped room. From the ring-shaped room,\
      \ go down the ramps and out into the inner corridor. From there, cross into\
      \ the small vault. There, you will find that the entrance which was previously\
      \ barred is open since you activated the lever. Follow the corridor through\
      \ from the entrance. Soon you will reach another small vault with barrels containing\
      \ 40 Tarydium Shards. There is a pool down a slope to the left, and a staircase\
      \ leads off to the right. Take the staircase.\n</p><p>At the bottom of the staircase\
      \ you will be in a room with a balcony above arches ahead, equipment crates\
      \ from the ISV-Kran to the right, and an entrance with bars across it to the\
      \ left. As you enter, you will be barred in behind and you will have another\
      \ almost-endless-supply-of-Krall-two-by-two scenario. Don't be fooled into staying\
      \ and fighting though - the bars on the left are not locked and will open if\
      \ you approach. If you do have an accident, then barrels in this main room reveal\
      \ a total of three Health Packs.\n</p><p>Killing very pissed-off Skaarj when\
      \ two Kralls attack from other side, can be very risky on higher difficulties.\
      \ Kralls are quite easilly killed if you have ammo and that way you only have\
      \ on-sided attack on your hands.\n</p><p>Anyway, open the bars and enter the\
      \ lift area beyond. A lift comes down - get on to it and kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ who attacks from above. At the top of the lift shaft, look back into the lift\
      \ chamber. Part of the wall is recessed on the right. Step into the recess and\
      \ it opens, revealing SIX boxes of 10 Flak Shells! Collect, then use the lift\
      \ again and get off on to the balcony above the storage room.\n</p><p>There's\
      \ a lever on this balcony. Press it, and the bars across the entrance open.\
      \ Before leaving though get what I brought you down here to collect; on top\
      \ of the equipment crates are a Flak Cannon and a Super Health Pack but most\
      \ importantly a set of <a href=\"/SCUBA_Gear\" title=\"SCUBA Gear\">SCUBA Gear</a>\
      \ (you may need a couple of tries jumping across to the Super Health Pack -\
      \ just go back up the lift).\n</p><p>When you have the stuff, retreat back up\
      \ the steps to the small vault. The Krall won't follow you. From the small vault\
      \ at the top, go down the slope to the pool entrance you saw earlier. By the\
      \ side of the pool, open barrels for a can of Tarydium Sludge and a box of 10\
      \ Flak Shells. Then, look to the wall where the water continues through into\
      \ a flooded cellar; this flooded cellar is barred off, but beneath the surface\
      \ of the water one part of the rightermost bar is missing.\n</p><p>Dive into\
      \ the water and collect of the two Nali Healing Fruit on this side of the bars.\
      \ Then, go through the gap in the bars. Kill the Devilfish that comes from the\
      \ left, before surfacing and climbing out on to the wooden platform beyond the\
      \ bars. Beware the Tentacle that snipes from the ceiling ahead.\n</p><p>Go straight\
      \ along the platform towards where the Tentacle was. It will lead you round\
      \ to the left, where a Krall is on guard. Kill the Krall, then dive into the\
      \ water to open a barrel for another box of 10 Flak Shells. Climb back on to\
      \ the platform then return along it to the bars where you came in.\n</p><p>Take\
      \ the other stretch of this platform along into the flooded section of the cellar\
      \ and jump across to the partially submerged section where the platform is damaged.\
      \ Kill the Tentacle that attacks from the left and also a Devilfish that may\
      \ see you from beneath the surface and try to climb out. Then, follow the damaged\
      \ platform round and kill the Krall and SkaarjWarrior that attack you from the\
      \ next straight. Beyond where the Skaarj and Krall were, a barrel contains a\
      \ can of 12 Eightballs.\n</p><p>Go down to the furthest end of the platform,\
      \ where a Tentacle attacks from the left. Dive into the water from the end of\
      \ the platform for two cans of 12 Eightballs. then follow the water tunnel in\
      \ the direction of the late Tentacle. At the end of that stretch, barrels contain\
      \ 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 50 Bullets. There's also another Devilfish\
      \ in this vicinity.\n</p><p>From this point, the water tunnels lead you naturally\
      \ back to the damaged section of the wooden walkway above. Go straight through\
      \ the broken timbers and along to a point in the floor of the flooded cellar\
      \ where a drainage grate has been removed, allowing you access to the vertical\
      \ shaft below.\n</p><p>Follow the vertical shaft. It turns into a meandering\
      \ conduit that brings you out eventually in a small circular flooded room inhabited\
      \ by three Tentacles on the ceiling.\n</p><p>Go round this room, collecting\
      \ the Super Health Pack, Assault Vest and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells on offer\
      \ here. Then, go to a lever at the back and press it. What you have done is\
      \ to open those large metal gates in the front corridor earlier in the map.\
      \ Remember them?\n</p><p>Anyway, time to leave this area now. Find the tunnel\
      \ you came out of and swim back along it, arriving back in the flooded cellar.\
      \ Such that you are facing away from the broken section of walkway, swim along\
      \ and open the barrel at the far end for another box of 10 Flak Shells. Then,\
      \ return to the broken walkway area and climb out. Follow the walkway back to\
      \ the bars you entered this flooded cellar by and return to the small vault\
      \ outside.\n</p><p>From the small vault, follow the curving horizontal corridor\
      \ back through to the first small vault. From there, go back through the open\
      \ doors into the inner cellar corridor and turn left. At the end, turn right\
      \ into the chamber before the shut door and go round to the still open bars,\
      \ thus bringing you back out to the front corridor. Once back in the front cellar\
      \ corridor, look to the left and you will see that the large metal grille gates\
      \ are indeed now open. Go through and kill the Brute patrolling to and fro beyond\
      \ the gates.\n</p><p>Go into the corridor beyond the gates and look both ways.\
      \ To the right, the corridor continues round a corner. To the left, it ends\
      \ with a barred hole in the floor. By this barred hole a winch in a wall recess\
      \ is also barred off. There are two boxes of 10 Flak Shells available in this\
      \ area.\nGo the other way down the corridor and round the corner. To the right\
      \ there, a flight of steps goes down another wide corridor. Ahead, the corridor\
      \ ends in an alcove with two barrels behind a fallen beam. Shoot one of the\
      \ barrels to collect the box of Razor Blades within, but leave the other intact.\
      \ Go round behind the remaining barrel and push it out into the corridor. Push\
      \ it back up the corridor and position it directly beneath the torch opposite\
      \ the gates.\n</p><p>Jump on to the barrel and from there jump again to head-butt\
      \ the torch. It moves up, and the bars draw back from the winch by the barred\
      \ hole. When this operation is successfully completed, step down and shoot the\
      \ barrel open to get another box of Razor Blades from inside. Then, go over\
      \ to the liberated winch and activate it. Bars draw back from the vertical shaft,\
      \ revealing a long drop with a pool at the bottom. So, plunge in and collect\
      \ an <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"Shock Rifle\">ASMD</a> from the floor\
      \ of the pool. Surface and climb out into the small tunnel there, then follow\
      \ it round until you reach a lift up.\n</p><p>Step on to the lift but step straight\
      \ off again so that it rises without you. Dive into the water beneath where\
      \ the lift was and open barrels at the bottom for a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a> and an ASMD Core,\
      \ but get out quicly before the lift can return and trap you in the pool. Then,\
      \ when the lift returns, ride it to the top. Kill the SkaarjWarrior lurking\
      \ in the tunnel leading off the top of the lift shaft, then follow the tunnel\
      \ until you pop out at the top of the steps by the broken beam where the barrel\
      \ you used as a step was. Very handy.\n</p><p>Time to get a move on now. So,\
      \ descend the steps and press the lever on the right at the bottom to open doors\
      \ on the left. Go through the doors, and you arrive in a large room guarded\
      \ by a Krall on the far side and a Brute who comes out of the exit from this\
      \ room on the right. As you enter the room two more Krall will attack, from\
      \ the shadows behind you and jumping down from a balcony above as appropriate.\
      \ Kill all four of the creatures. Barrels in this room can be raided for a can\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge. When you're done, go through the exit the Brute was guarding.\
      \ Beware the Krall who jumps down from the main room balcony as you enter the\
      \ alcove.\n</p><p>In this alcove, a pair of lifts are operated by a winch. Activate\
      \ the winch to call the lifts, then get on the lift to the left. When the lift\
      \ has returned to the top with you aboard, climb the steps that meet the top\
      \ of the lift you used and follow the passage through to a small loft where\
      \ five Nali are crucified.\n</p><p>Put the unfortunate natives out of their\
      \ misery. When they're dead, collect of the five Nali Healing Fruit available\
      \ at the base of each of the crosses. Return down the passage to the top of\
      \ the lifts, then step across the lift onto the central wooden platform between\
      \ the two lifts. This platform leads out on to the balcony above the main room\
      \ below. Take the balcony round to the left and go along to the far end of the\
      \ room where you can get a box of 10 Flak Shells and a can of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ Go across to the other side of the balconies, and you can collect another\
      \ can of 12 Eightballs in the corner.\n</p><p>At this end of the room, a corridor\
      \ to a flight of steps leads out of the room. Go through and climb the steps.\
      \ At the top, you will be in a small room with pillars and a locked metal grille\
      \ gate on the far side. As you enter the room, bars close over the entrance\
      \ at the foot of the stairs. Two Krall will drop down from the rafters. When\
      \ they are dead, two more will come down. Things will continue in this way until\
      \ you have killed about fourteen Krall, whereupon the gates will open and the\
      \ Krall flow will stop. Raid this room for supplies; two cans of Tarydium Sludge\
      \ are at the base of the pillars, while barrels by the metal gates contain two\
      \ ASMD Cores.\n</p><p>Time to be adventurous... step out through the metal gates\
      \ and kill the Brute in the next corridor. Go out into the corridor to raid\
      \ barrels for three Health Packs, but beware the <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjBerserker</a> who drops in through a ceiling\
      \ hole. Follow the corridor round and look into the next room, which may at\
      \ first seem empty. But enter a little further and two very large Behemoths\
      \ stride out from behind pillars and start hurling rockets at you - I strongly\
      \ advise retreat.\n</p><p>Find a good weapon - Flak Bombs seem quite effective\
      \ - and kill the Behemoths. Cross their room, being careful not to fall down\
      \ the gaps between the bars over a small lava pit in the middle, until you reach\
      \ the far end where an exit is blocked by a white stone barrier. Back out into\
      \ the room a short distance and press the lever to the right near the exit's\
      \ alcove. Shortly, a lift descends in front of the entrance - step on it and\
      \ ride it to the top.\n</p><p>Cross the bar at the top of the lift shaft and\
      \ you are on a balcony over the Behemoth room. Follow the balcony to the right\
      \ and go along the length of the room, opening barrels at the far end for two\
      \ Health Packs. Follow the balcony on round. Shortly you will come to a lever\
      \ on a protrusion facing back along the room; press it and you will see the\
      \ white barrier over the exit removed. Before going back down though, just complete\
      \ your rounds of the balcony. Anticlockwise, the next barrels reveal two Bandages,\
      \ and when you are almost back at the lift you can collect two cans of Tarydium\
      \ Sludge and a can of 12 Eightballs from near a SkaarjWarrior's corpse.\n</p><p>Time\
      \ to leave now. Drop to the floor of the room and head for the uncovered exit.\
      \ Follow the corridor down beyond and enter a small room with a water feature\
      \ to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translator_Messages\"\

      ==Walkthrough==\n''This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature\
      \ and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\nNow within\
      \ the Dasa cellars, you face a long slog through these subterranean halls, corridors\
      \ and rooms. Some of these extensive cellars are flooded and all of them are\
      \ extensively populated by the Skaarj and their minions; the journey will not\
      \ be an easy one.\n\nYou start just beyond the door you came through at the\
      \ end of the previous level. You are in a tall circular chamber with a pillar\
      \ at the centre and exits at the back and on the left.\n\nGo anticlockwise round\
      \ the pillar, killing a [[Tentacle]] that snipes from a recess in the ceiling\
      \ near the back, then arriving at the back of the room where you can collect\
      \ an [[Enforcer|Automag]]. The back exit leads to another room but it is barred\
      \ - kill at this point the two KrallElites who shoot between the bars from the\
      \ room beyond.\n\nYou can't go through this exit yet, so go on round to the\
      \ side exit. Follow the corridor beyond and you go round into a room with platforms\
      \ and fallen beams over water. This room is guarded by a trio of Krall - kill\
      \ them (once again I recommend the [[Bio Rifle|GES Biorifle]]). When the Krall\
      \ are dead, look around. You are on the lower of the three platforms; you can\
      \ climb the fallen beams to get to the raised ones.\n\nClimb first to the raised\
      \ balcony on the right. There, barrels contain a box of 8 Rifle Rounds. Go back\
      \ down and climb up on to the other raised balcony: there, containers reveal\
      \ a Clip and a can of Tarydium Sludge. There's also a winch handle up here,\
      \ so turn it. You have opened the bars on the first exit from the circular room.\
      \ Before returning though, take a dip in the water around the lower platform.\
      \ This water is patrolled by four [[Devilfish]], but if you're playing on one\
      \ of the lower skill settings they can each be gibbed in one shot with the Power\
      \ 5 [[Dispersion Pistol]].\n\nShoot the four barrels on the floor of the pool.\
      \ Two of them reveal a pair of ASMD Cores, whilst the other two contain two\
      \ boxes of 10 Flak Shells. Come up for air, then dive back down; shine a light\
      \ into the dark corner of the pool behind the pillar. You will see an entrance\
      \ a short way up from floor level on the back wall; go inside and follow the\
      \ underwater shaft beyond. Surface in the small chamber at the end; here, several\
      \ [[Nali]] corpses are guarded by two Tentacles. When you've killed the Tentacles,\
      \ you can collect a [[Super Health Pack]] from the floor here.\n\nReturn along\
      \ the underwater shaft and climb out of the water back on to the platform. Return\
      \ down the corridor to the circular room, then go through the newly opened exit\
      \ clockwise from there. Go through into the room beyond.\n\nThe room you are\
      \ now in has a locked door ahead, a balcony above, a raised alcove on the left,\
      \ and a lift shaft to the balcony in a recess on the right. Collect of the three\
      \ [[Nali Healing Fruit]] here, then go to the lift shaft. As you approach the\
      \ lift shaft, the lift descends to greet you. So, step on the lift. As you do\
      \ so, a [[Brute]] in the alcove will spot you and start hurling rockets at you.\
      \ Dodge his rockets until the lift rises but otherwise ignore him. At the top,\
      \ step along the stone beam and you will be on the balcony.\n\nOn the balcony,\
      \ two Krall will attack from either side. Kill them, then go anticlockwise round\
      \ the balcony. At the second corner, you will find an [[Assault Vest]] behind\
      \ barrels containing a can of 12 Eightballs. At the third corner, a crate contains\
      \ a box of 8 Rifle Rounds. Then, you will come to a winch. Turn the winch and\
      \ the doors at the far end of the area below swing open. Drop down and go through\
      \ the doors before they close again. Safely installed in the next corridor,\
      \ look around.\nTo the right, some large metal grille gates bar the way to a\
      \ large corridor patrolled by a Brute. Ahead is a locked door. To the left,\
      \ a small door on the left of the corridor is open while a doorway to the right\
      \ of the corridor is blocked by bars. Go up to the far end of this stretch of\
      \ corridor in that direction, and look to the left at the corner.\n\nIn this\
      \ stretch, a fallen beam to the right leads up to the alcove the Brute shot\
      \ from earlier. Climb the beam and kill the Brute then collect the Clip from\
      \ nearby. Return to the bottom of the beam, then shoot out of the way the barrels\
      \ that obstruct your passage to a pair of crucified Nali over a pool of blood\
      \ at the end. Put the Nali out of their misery.\n\nBefore returning to the main\
      \ stretch of corridor, climb the narrow steps opposite the fallen beam and go\
      \ on to the beams over the main stretch of corridor below. Collect the [[Ripper|Razorjack]]\
      \ here then drop down the gap ahead to the corridor floor below. Then, go along\
      \ in the direction away from the metal gates and take the small open door on\
      \ the left. Kill the Krall within, then open barrels for a box of 10 Flak Shells.\
      \ This room also contains a winch operated by a lever. Activate the lever, and\
      \ the two entrances on the other side of the front corridor are opened, i.e.\
      \ the bars and the doors.\n\nGo through the opened doors. On entering the corridor\
      \ beyond, a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]] will dart out from\
      \ a chamber on the left. Kill him, then another SkaarjWarrior who comes down\
      \ the corridor from the far end. By the time both Skaarj are dead, the doors\
      \ will have closed. However, if you go into the chamber on the left, you will\
      \ find that the bars out to the front corridor which lead off this room have\
      \ not closed and you can still go out if you want to. You will also find two\
      \ boxes of 10 Flak Shells.\n\nReturn to the inner corridor where you fought\
      \ the SkaarjWarriors. Look along its length.\n\nExplore the offshoots of this\
      \ corridor. Openable doors on the left lead only to barred corridors, while\
      \ open doors on the right are more rewarding, going into a small vault where\
      \ containers reveal two Clips and 40 Tarydium Shards, but an entrance at the\
      \ back of this vault is barred off too. Return to the corridor and go along\
      \ to the junction at the end. On the right there is an alcove where crates reveal\
      \ three cans of 12 Eightballs. Then, go along the other route from the junction.\
      \ There, an entrance at the foot of a flight of steps is also barred off. So,\
      \ climb the steps.\n\nThe room at the top of the sweeping staircase is a large\
      \ partially open-roofed circular room with a wide pillar in the middle. Looks\
      \ innocuous enough... but go further into the room and things will get a lot\
      \ worse. A hatch wall on the left opens to reveal an alcove out of which a virtually\
      \ endless supply of Krall emerges in twos. To make matters worse, a [[Titan|StoneTitan]]\
      \ is lurking behind the pillar who'll take a pretty instant dislike to you.\n\
      \nFortunately for you, the player, the StoneTitan hates Krall even more than\
      \ he hates you. What you need to do to get out of this room as you are barred\
      \ in, is to find and press a protruding brick on the back of a big central pillar.\
      \ This opens a section of wall that is in the patch of light on the dark wall\
      \ that is to the right as you enter. If you can get the StoneTitan distracted\
      \ by the Krall, you can avoid both parties while you get out of the room.\n\n\
      If you do have enough ammo and do not want to take risks (recommended for higher\
      \ difficulty levels), you can kill Titan without waking up Kralls (to make stonewall\
      \ go away). Enter room just a bit, without barricading entryway on your back.\
      \ Shoot Titan and it will follow you into corridor. You know what to do. After\
      \ that, press brick and proceed through secret door.\n\nSo, go for it. Enter\
      \ the room and get the StoneTitan to notice the Krall instead of you by hiding\
      \ behind the pillar while the Krall come out - you'll need to wake the Titan\
      \ up yourself first. Then, press the brick and go through the secret door into\
      \ the corridor beyond.\n\nThe secret corridor turns into a flight of spiral\
      \ steps. Climb the steps to the corridor at the top, but beware the nasty [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin|SkaarjAssassin]]\
      \ lying in wait along the corridor. When the Skaarj is dead, follow the corridor\
      \ round and you will come out on a balcony above the room around the central\
      \ pillar. Go to the left visiting the two boxes of Flak Shells on the way until\
      \ you can see an alcove above the barred entrance containing a button. Run off\
      \ so that you fall into this alcove then press the button (don't jump, just\
      \ run). Be careful not to be squished by the bars over the entrance as they\
      \ spring back up. When the entrance bars are removed, go down to the floor of\
      \ the room and retreat down the stairs from the StoneTitan into safety.\n\n\
      If you are willing to brave the Titan room again, go through the previously\
      \ barred entrance that leads through the outer wall immediately at the bottom\
      \ of the flight of steps. Follow the corridor beyond round to another pair of\
      \ bars, which open as you approach, then plunge into the water pool beyond.\
      \ Follow the pool as it turns into an underwater shaft - soon you can swim up\
      \ through a grate that opens to collect four cans of Tarydium Sludge and a [[Flak\
      \ Cannon]] from the floor of the cistern you are then in.\n\nSwim up the cistern\
      \ and surface at the top. Climb out, and you are on the balcony above the Titan\
      \ room again. Find a safe moment and drop to the floor of the Titan room, retreating\
      \ once more down the flight of steps. If you consider it worth the risk (I don't),\
      \ you can go down via the Krall alcove and go to the back to collect the two\
      \ clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards there, but either way, escape from the room\
      \ and go back down the steps.\n\nNow, go along the corridor to the junction.\
      \ A new stretch of corridor has been revealed on the left; kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ lurking within, then go along to the end past a pair of Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ growing out of lifted sections of the floor, pressing the lever at the end.\
      \ Pressing the lever opened the bars behind the openable doors in the inner\
      \ corridor, so do an about turn and go down the corridor across the junction,\
      \ entering the first door on the right and going through the open bars, climbing\
      \ the ramp beyond. At the top, you will have an altercation with two Krall and\
      \ a beefy [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord|SkaarjLord]]. Kill all three.\n\nLook\
      \ around this area. You are in a ring-shaped room with a separate walled off\
      \ room in the centre; doors at either end of the walled off room are locked.\
      \ At either end of the ring-shaped room, you can collect two cans of 12 Eightballs\
      \ from behind pillars. When you've collected what you need, go to the end of\
      \ the room that was to the left as you entered.\n\nAt this end of the room there\
      \ is a counterweight operated by a pair of levers. Activate the levers, then\
      \ go to the far end of the ring. You will see a metal grille lift descend with\
      \ a SkaarjWarrior on it; kill the Skaarj then step aboard the lift yourself\
      \ (if necessary then call it again). Ride the lift to the top and go through\
      \ the opening there. You will come out on a high balcony above the inside of\
      \ the walled off room; look down and you will see that the walled off room is\
      \ a deep water store with a Super Health Pack inaccessible on a pillar in the\
      \ centre.\n\nGo to the far end of the balcony and you will see a button. Be\
      \ sure to press it, as it raises a flight of steps around the central pillar\
      \ making the Super Health Pack accessible.\n\nDrop down into the water pool.\
      \ Underwater are four [[Devilfish]]; kill the fish, then collect of the four\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit in the corners of the pool. Swim down to the bottom of\
      \ the pool beneath the Super Health Pack pillar and you will find a lever there\
      \ - activate it. Turn round and face the wall of the pool beneath the button\
      \ you activated above. Shoot a tile just below half way up on the right and\
      \ it opens to reveal three 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge. Then, swim to the surface\
      \ and climb out on to the base of the Super Health Pack pillar.\n\nClimb the\
      \ steps you raised to get the Super Health Pack, then jump off on to the walkway\
      \ around the edge of the pool. Go to either of the end doors, which are open\
      \ since you pressed the lever, and go out into the ring-shaped room. From the\
      \ ring-shaped room, go down the ramps and out into the inner corridor. From\
      \ there, cross into the small vault. There, you will find that the entrance\
      \ which was previously barred is open since you activated the lever. Follow\
      \ the corridor through from the entrance. Soon you will reach another small\
      \ vault with barrels containing 40 Tarydium Shards. There is a pool down a slope\
      \ to the left, and a staircase leads off to the right. Take the staircase.\n\
      \nAt the bottom of the staircase you will be in a room with a balcony above\
      \ arches ahead, equipment crates from the ISV-Kran to the right, and an entrance\
      \ with bars across it to the left. As you enter, you will be barred in behind\
      \ and you will have another almost-endless-supply-of-Krall-two-by-two scenario.\
      \ Don't be fooled into staying and fighting though - the bars on the left are\
      \ not locked and will open if you approach. If you do have an accident, then\
      \ barrels in this main room reveal a total of three Health Packs.\n\nKilling\
      \ very pissed-off Skaarj when two Kralls attack from other side, can be very\
      \ risky on higher difficulties. Kralls are quite easilly killed if you have\
      \ ammo and that way you only have on-sided attack on your hands.\n\nAnyway,\
      \ open the bars and enter the lift area beyond. A lift comes down - get on to\
      \ it and kill the SkaarjWarrior who attacks from above. At the top of the lift\
      \ shaft, look back into the lift chamber. Part of the wall is recessed on the\
      \ right. Step into the recess and it opens, revealing SIX boxes of 10 Flak Shells!\
      \ Collect, then use the lift again and get off on to the balcony above the storage\
      \ room.\n\nThere's a lever on this balcony. Press it, and the bars across the\
      \ entrance open. Before leaving though get what I brought you down here to collect;\
      \ on top of the equipment crates are a Flak Cannon and a Super Health Pack but\
      \ most importantly a set of [[SCUBA Gear]] (you may need a couple of tries jumping\
      \ across to the Super Health Pack - just go back up the lift).\n\nWhen you have\
      \ the stuff, retreat back up the steps to the small vault. The Krall won't follow\
      \ you. From the small vault at the top, go down the slope to the pool entrance\
      \ you saw earlier. By the side of the pool, open barrels for a can of Tarydium\
      \ Sludge and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Then, look to the wall where the water\
      \ continues through into a flooded cellar; this flooded cellar is barred off,\
      \ but beneath the surface of the water one part of the rightermost bar is missing.\n\
      \nDive into the water and collect of the two Nali Healing Fruit on this side\
      \ of the bars. Then, go through the gap in the bars. Kill the Devilfish that\
      \ comes from the left, before surfacing and climbing out on to the wooden platform\
      \ beyond the bars. Beware the Tentacle that snipes from the ceiling ahead.\n\
      \nGo straight along the platform towards where the Tentacle was. It will lead\
      \ you round to the left, where a Krall is on guard. Kill the Krall, then dive\
      \ into the water to open a barrel for another box of 10 Flak Shells. Climb back\
      \ on to the platform then return along it to the bars where you came in.\n\n\
      Take the other stretch of this platform along into the flooded section of the\
      \ cellar and jump across to the partially submerged section where the platform\
      \ is damaged. Kill the Tentacle that attacks from the left and also a Devilfish\
      \ that may see you from beneath the surface and try to climb out. Then, follow\
      \ the damaged platform round and kill the Krall and SkaarjWarrior that attack\
      \ you from the next straight. Beyond where the Skaarj and Krall were, a barrel\
      \ contains a can of 12 Eightballs.\n\nGo down to the furthest end of the platform,\
      \ where a Tentacle attacks from the left. Dive into the water from the end of\
      \ the platform for two cans of 12 Eightballs. then follow the water tunnel in\
      \ the direction of the late Tentacle. At the end of that stretch, barrels contain\
      \ 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 50 Bullets. There's also another Devilfish\
      \ in this vicinity.\n\nFrom this point, the water tunnels lead you naturally\
      \ back to the damaged section of the wooden walkway above. Go straight through\
      \ the broken timbers and along to a point in the floor of the flooded cellar\
      \ where a drainage grate has been removed, allowing you access to the vertical\
      \ shaft below.\n\nFollow the vertical shaft. It turns into a meandering conduit\
      \ that brings you out eventually in a small circular flooded room inhabited\
      \ by three Tentacles on the ceiling.\n\nGo round this room, collecting the Super\
      \ Health Pack, Assault Vest and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells on offer here. Then,\
      \ go to a lever at the back and press it. What you have done is to open those\
      \ large metal gates in the front corridor earlier in the map. Remember them?\n\
      \nAnyway, time to leave this area now. Find the tunnel you came out of and swim\
      \ back along it, arriving back in the flooded cellar. Such that you are facing\
      \ away from the broken section of walkway, swim along and open the barrel at\
      \ the far end for another box of 10 Flak Shells. Then, return to the broken\
      \ walkway area and climb out. Follow the walkway back to the bars you entered\
      \ this flooded cellar by and return to the small vault outside.\n\nFrom the\
      \ small vault, follow the curving horizontal corridor back through to the first\
      \ small vault. From there, go back through the open doors into the inner cellar\
      \ corridor and turn left. At the end, turn right into the chamber before the\
      \ shut door and go round to the still open bars, thus bringing you back out\
      \ to the front corridor. Once back in the front cellar corridor, look to the\
      \ left and you will see that the large metal grille gates are indeed now open.\
      \ Go through and kill the Brute patrolling to and fro beyond the gates.\n\n\
      Go into the corridor beyond the gates and look both ways. To the right, the\
      \ corridor continues round a corner. To the left, it ends with a barred hole\
      \ in the floor. By this barred hole a winch in a wall recess is also barred\
      \ off. There are two boxes of 10 Flak Shells available in this area.\nGo the\
      \ other way down the corridor and round the corner. To the right there, a flight\
      \ of steps goes down another wide corridor. Ahead, the corridor ends in an alcove\
      \ with two barrels behind a fallen beam. Shoot one of the barrels to collect\
      \ the box of Razor Blades within, but leave the other intact. Go round behind\
      \ the remaining barrel and push it out into the corridor. Push it back up the\
      \ corridor and position it directly beneath the torch opposite the gates.\n\n\
      Jump on to the barrel and from there jump again to head-butt the torch. It moves\
      \ up, and the bars draw back from the winch by the barred hole. When this operation\
      \ is successfully completed, step down and shoot the barrel open to get another\
      \ box of Razor Blades from inside. Then, go over to the liberated winch and\
      \ activate it. Bars draw back from the vertical shaft, revealing a long drop\
      \ with a pool at the bottom. So, plunge in and collect an [[Shock Rifle|ASMD]]\
      \ from the floor of the pool. Surface and climb out into the small tunnel there,\
      \ then follow it round until you reach a lift up.\n\nStep on to the lift but\
      \ step straight off again so that it rises without you. Dive into the water\
      \ beneath where the lift was and open barrels at the bottom for a [[Shield Belt]]\
      \ and an ASMD Core, but get out quicly before the lift can return and trap you\
      \ in the pool. Then, when the lift returns, ride it to the top. Kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ lurking in the tunnel leading off the top of the lift shaft, then follow the\
      \ tunnel until you pop out at the top of the steps by the broken beam where\
      \ the barrel you used as a step was. Very handy.\n\nTime to get a move on now.\
      \ So, descend the steps and press the lever on the right at the bottom to open\
      \ doors on the left. Go through the doors, and you arrive in a large room guarded\
      \ by a Krall on the far side and a Brute who comes out of the exit from this\
      \ room on the right. As you enter the room two more Krall will attack, from\
      \ the shadows behind you and jumping down from a balcony above as appropriate.\
      \ Kill all four of the creatures. Barrels in this room can be raided for a can\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge. When you're done, go through the exit the Brute was guarding.\
      \ Beware the Krall who jumps down from the main room balcony as you enter the\
      \ alcove.\n\nIn this alcove, a pair of lifts are operated by a winch. Activate\
      \ the winch to call the lifts, then get on the lift to the left. When the lift\
      \ has returned to the top with you aboard, climb the steps that meet the top\
      \ of the lift you used and follow the passage through to a small loft where\
      \ five Nali are crucified.\n\nPut the unfortunate natives out of their misery.\
      \ When they're dead, collect of the five Nali Healing Fruit available at the\
      \ base of each of the crosses. Return down the passage to the top of the lifts,\
      \ then step across the lift onto the central wooden platform between the two\
      \ lifts. This platform leads out on to the balcony above the main room below.\
      \ Take the balcony round to the left and go along to the far end of the room\
      \ where you can get a box of 10 Flak Shells and a can of 12 Eightballs. Go across\
      \ to the other side of the balconies, and you can collect another can of 12\
      \ Eightballs in the corner.\n\nAt this end of the room, a corridor to a flight\
      \ of steps leads out of the room. Go through and climb the steps. At the top,\
      \ you will be in a small room with pillars and a locked metal grille gate on\
      \ the far side. As you enter the room, bars close over the entrance at the foot\
      \ of the stairs. Two Krall will drop down from the rafters. When they are dead,\
      \ two more will come down. Things will continue in this way until you have killed\
      \ about fourteen Krall, whereupon the gates will open and the Krall flow will\
      \ stop. Raid this room for supplies; two cans of Tarydium Sludge are at the\
      \ base of the pillars, while barrels by the metal gates contain two ASMD Cores.\n\
      \nTime to be adventurous... step out through the metal gates and kill the Brute\
      \ in the next corridor. Go out into the corridor to raid barrels for three Health\
      \ Packs, but beware the [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker|SkaarjBerserker]]\
      \ who drops in through a ceiling hole. Follow the corridor round and look into\
      \ the next room, which may at first seem empty. But enter a little further and\
      \ two very large Behemoths stride out from behind pillars and start hurling\
      \ rockets at you - I strongly advise retreat.\n\nFind a good weapon - Flak Bombs\
      \ seem quite effective - and kill the Behemoths. Cross their room, being careful\
      \ not to fall down the gaps between the bars over a small lava pit in the middle,\
      \ until you reach the far end where an exit is blocked by a white stone barrier.\
      \ Back out into the room a short distance and press the lever to the right near\
      \ the exit's alcove. Shortly, a lift descends in front of the entrance - step\
      \ on it and ride it to the top.\n\nCross the bar at the top of the lift shaft\
      \ and you are on a balcony over the Behemoth room. Follow the balcony to the\
      \ right and go along the length of the room, opening barrels at the far end\
      \ for two Health Packs. Follow the balcony on round. Shortly you will come to\
      \ a lever on a protrusion facing back along the room; press it and you will\
      \ see the white barrier over the exit removed. Before going back down though,\
      \ just complete your rounds of the balcony. Anticlockwise, the next barrels\
      \ reveal two Bandages, and when you are almost back at the lift you can collect\
      \ two cans of Tarydium Sludge and a can of 12 Eightballs from near a SkaarjWarrior's\
      \ corpse.\n\nTime to leave now. Drop to the floor of the room and head for the\
      \ uncovered exit. Follow the corridor down beyond and enter a small room with\
      \ a water feature to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\nNone.\n\n{{Prevnext|Dasa\
