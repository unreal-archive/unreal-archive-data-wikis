      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>A large <a href=\"/Nali\" title=\"Nali\">Nali</a> stronghold stands in\
      \ a mountain valley. You are within breathing distance of the <a href=\"/Skaarj\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> Mothership now, although you don't know it yet,\
      \ and the place is infested with Skaarj and their minions. And that's not all...\n\
      </p><p>You start in the cave you entered at the end of the previous map. To\
      \ the left, there is a pool of water, and to the right a cave entrance leading\
      \ outdoors. Go towards the pool. As you approach the pool, a <a href=\"/Gasbag\"\
      \ title=\"Gasbag\">Gasbag</a> comes down from the ceiling; mow it down with\
      \ an <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"Shock Rifle\">ASMD</a> Combo or two. Dive\
      \ into the pool and swim to a rock at the back, where you can swim out to collect\
      \ an ASMD clutched by a dead Nali.\n</p><p>Return to dry land and go down the\
      \ tunnel out of the main cave. Shortly, you will arrive on a plateau in front\
      \ of the Nali castle with an access bridge and portcullis ahead.\n</p><p>As\
      \ you arrive on the plateau, a <a href=\"/Krall\" title=\"Krall\">Krall</a>\
      \ sleeping at his post will wake up and make a run for the castle entrance across\
      \ the access bridge. Decapitate him with the <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"\
      Sniper Rifle\">Rifle</a> before he can get inside, because if he gets in he'll\
      \ shut the portcullis on you. As he dies, he drops a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>.\n</p><p>Collect\
      \ the <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit</a> from on the left here then go across the bridge, collecting the\
      \ Shield Belt on the way. Go through the castle entrance; follow the corridor\
      \ beyond and go through either of the two sets of doors, then arriving in the\
      \ main entrance foyer.\n</p><p>Note: If you do get locked out, then you will\
      \ need another way in. I am about to explain very quickly how to get in such\
      \ that you end up in the main entrance foyer as above, so if you managed to\
      \ kill the Krall before he could close the portcullis, go to §.\n</p><p>Jump\
      \ off the right hand side of the access bridge such that you land in the moat.\
      \ Swim along in that direction. Soon you will see a low balcony round the corner\
      \ of one of the castle buildings lit by a single torch. Swim to the corner of\
      \ the rock that supports the castle and climb out up the slope of the rock just\
      \ before the rock turns the corner. Go up hard against the balcony wall then\
      \ go up the rock parallel to it. This is the only route by which the rock is\
      \ shallow enough for you to climb out. Anyway, when you are high up enough,\
      \ go over the balcony wall and on to the balcony itself (alternatively, you\
      \ can shoot a grating underwater and gain access to the castle from there, but\
      \ I would recommend taking the route detailed here).\n</p><p>Follow the balcony\
      \ anticlockwise around this part of the castle building until you can go in\
      \ through a door. Inside, you will find a Krall in the shadows looking over\
      \ some beams to a room deeper in the castle; kill it. You will also probably\
      \ have to fight a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker\" title=\"Skaarj\
      \ Warrior\">SkaarjBerserker</a> who follows you in from outside. When they are\
      \ dead, climb up the flights of wooden steps you are now standing by. At the\
      \ top, you will come out on a higher walkway round the castle. Turn left and\
      \ follow the walkway round the building. When the walkway takes you inside,\
      \ go to the far side of the room and make a right. At the feet of a Nali statue,\
      \ turn left and immediately right such that you come out in a dining hall. Climb\
      \ the ramp on the left in the dining hall and go left again at the top along\
      \ a corridor, which will at last bring you out in the castle's main entrance\
      \ foyer. You may want to go through one of the sets of double doors on the other\
      \ side to find the Krall that locked you out so that you can take his Shield\
      \ Belt. When you're done, return to the foyer.\n</p><p>§ Inside the main entrance\
      \ foyer, kill the two Krall that jump down from balconies on either side, then\
      \ look around.\n</p><p>Facing inwards with a ramp upwards in front of you, there\
      \ are four routes out of this main entrance foyer. There are two on the lower\
      \ level that you are standing on, and two on balconies on either side of the\
      \ central ramp. Go up the ramp and take a left, going round the left balcony\
      \ and into a corridor beyond. Soon you will come to some shut doors with an\
      \ inscription nearby [1].\n</p><p>Maybe not that way yet then. Return to the\
      \ balcony and go round to the exit on the other side of the balcony level in\
      \ the foyer. Going through, you will arrive on a balcony above the aforementioned\
      \ chapel. Two Gasbags whom you should kill will see you and attack, but after\
      \ you've killed them, don't drop to the chapel floor. I'll be taking you there\
      \ later instead.\n</p><p>Go back to the foyer and drop down to the lower level\
      \ of the foyer. Take the entrance that is on the right when you stand facing\
      \ the ramp. You will be on a balcony with a view of a Nali statue; turn right\
      \ and enter a small library room there. Although the library is empty, there's\
      \ an open book on a table to the right. Read it [2].\n</p><p>Sounds interesting...\
      \ leave the library and return to the main entrance foyer. Take the other exit\
      \ on the lower level. Follow the corridor beyond, and you will come out on a\
      \ balcony above a large dining hall.\n</p><p>Drop down to the floor of the hall.\
      \ Chests on the left can be opened to reveal an ASMD Core and a <a href=\"/Flashlight\"\
      \ title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a>. Then, do what the book in the library\
      \ said and go to look at the book cases on the far side of the room. One book\
      \ is protruding out of the leftermost case; push it in. The section of wall\
      \ with the two central book cases on swivels round revealing two Krall. Kill\
      \ the Krall. By the time they are dead the book case will probably have swivelled\
      \ back round, so press the book again and this time stand at the central point\
      \ at the base of the swivelling wall after it has swung round once, and it will\
      \ swivel back, taking you with it.\n</p><p>You will be in a small hidden room\
      \ with a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super\
      \ Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> and a switch. Take the pack, then press\
      \ the switch to make the wall swivel again. Use it to get back out to the main\
      \ feast hall.\nBack in the hall, although you could go back up a ramp to the\
      \ balcony, there's a corridor leading off at the ground floor here. So, take\
      \ the corridor. At the end, turn right. After a couple of steps down, you will\
      \ be in a short stretch of corridor where you can open crates for two Health\
      \ Packs and a box of 10 Flak Shells. In doing so, you will attract the attention\
      \ of a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjGunner</a>\
      \ with an <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a>\
      \ in the room at the far end. Decapitate him with some well placed rifle rounds,\
      \ then climb the steps at the other end of the short stretch of corridor. Enter\
      \ the room the Skaarj was lurking in, which is a small kitchen.\n</p><p>Collect\
      \ the Skaarj's Eightball Gun then look around. There are two Nali Fruit <a href=\"\
      /Seeds\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Seeds\">Seeds</a> on the central table,\
      \ but it's too high to jump. So, push one of the barrels in the room up to the\
      \ table and use it as a step. Collect the seeds, then destroy the barrels to\
      \ get two <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flares</a>. Then, leave the kitchen\
      \ by a corridor that was to the right as you entered. In the area beyond, a\
      \ flight of steps leads up to a balcony above the feast hall. Before climbing\
      \ the steps, go to the right and destroy crates in the shadows for a Health\
      \ Pack and two cans of 12 Eightballs. Collect the <a href=\"/Energy_Amplifier\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Energy Amplifier\">Energy Amplifier</a> in an\
      \ alcove under the stairs.\n</p><p>Go up the stairs on to the balcony and collect\
      \ of the two cans of 12 Eightballs at the leftermost end of the balcony. Drop\
      \ to the floor of the feast hall and take once again the corridor that leaves\
      \ it at floor level, but this time go left at the end, such that you arrive\
      \ at the feet of the big Nali statue. Go to the right from the feet into the\
      \ small room beyond. You'll pass a door to the chapel on the left but we're\
      \ still not going in there yet; just keep going straight on. In the next room,\
      \ an exit leads on to an outdoor walkway on the left, while a flight of steps\
      \ curves down ahead. Take the steps.\n</p><p>You will arrive on a balcony in\
      \ a cellar room, where you will be able to hear Krall talking to each other.\
      \ First things first, collect the two boxes of 10 Flak Shells on the left and\
      \ open chests for two more cans of 12 Eightballs. Then, go to the edge that\
      \ this balcony overlooks. Below are two levels of a long room with doors on\
      \ either side. Three Krall are muttering to each other on the top level; pummel\
      \ them with a few pre-loaded Eightballs in a circle.\n</p><p>Some Krall will\
      \ probably get away through the doors at the end of the lower level of this\
      \ area. Don't worry about them, you'll find them again later. Drop down to the\
      \ floor of the the upper level, watching out for a Krall who snipes from some\
      \ beams beyond the lower level doors - that is unless you came in via the moat,\
      \ in which case it'll already be dead.\n</p><p>On this upper level there are\
      \ four doors. Starting with the first one on the left, go through them clockwise\
      \ one by one. They turn out to be simple sleeping chambers; the first is empty,\
      \ the second contains a dozing <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScout</a>. The third too is empty, but the fourth is\
      \ more rewarding, containing a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a> but also an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a> behind the bed.\n</p><p>Leave\
      \ the chambers and drop down to the lower level. Doors at the sides are locked,\
      \ but signs here should give you a clue [3].\n</p><p>At last, you have some\
      \ direction; you have to go to the chapel to unlock the tower, kill a monster\
      \ of some kind in the tower, then come back to the dungeon. So, go through the\
      \ doors at the end of this lower level and into the area beyond.\n</p><p>The\
      \ next room is a tall stairwell. Wooden flights of steps spiral up to the top;\
      \ climb them all. There's a walkway that leads outside part of the way up but\
      \ all you will find on that balcony is a SkaarjBerserker who may drop down from\
      \ above if you haven't already encountered him by coming in via the moat.\n\
      </p><p>At the top of the stairs, a stone ramp leads outside onto another outdoor\
      \ balcony. From this point on, keep an eye open for any enemies who escaped\
      \ from the dungeon area earlier as they'll be roaming this area. Anyway, step\
      \ on to the balcony and turn right; you will come to a cable car that travels\
      \ out to an entrance on the other side of the moat, but it doesn't move. So,\
      \ go the other way along the balcony until it leads you back inside; you will\
      \ be back in the room at the top of the curving steps down to the dungeon area.\n\
      </p><p>Go to the right then turn right again before you reach the Nali statue,\
      \ so that you come out in the chapel.\n</p><p>Go along the red carpet towards\
      \ a ramp and then go up the ramp (an alcove beneath the ramp contains a Health\
      \ Pack should you need it). At the top, go round the back of a small reading\
      \ pillar and look at it, and you will see a book. Go forwards and read the book\
      \ [4].\n</p><p>As you approached the reading pillar, a button on the front will\
      \ have been pressed in. The button should have opened the way to the tower now,\
      \ so return to the Nali statue's feet and find your way back to the main entrance\
      \ foyer via the main feast hall. Within the foyer, go up the ramp and take the\
      \ exit from the balcony on the left.\n</p><p>In the corridor beyond, the gate\
      \ is indeed now open. Climb the slope of the corridor and you will be in an\
      \ upper corridor that stretches off to both the left and right. The other wall\
      \ of this corridor has entrances to several smart sleeping chambers, so go to\
      \ the leftermost end of the corridor and visit the chambers one by one.\n</p><p>In\
      \ the first chamber, a box by the bed contains a Health Pack. In the second\
      \ chamber, a SkaarjScout is dozing on the bed. Kill him then collect the Rifle\
      \ and box of 8 Rifle Rounds from the bedside box. The third chamber is empty,\
      \ but the box in the fourth chamber contains a can of 12 Eightballs and a <a\
      \ href=\"/Bio_Rifle\" title=\"Bio Rifle\">GES Biorifle</a>.\n</p><p>Opposite\
      \ the door to the fourth chamber is an exit to a rooftop garden. Go through\
      \ into the garden beyond.\n</p><p>At this first end of the garden you can collect\
      \ two Nali Healing Fruit, and barrels contain three clusters of 40 Tayrdium\
      \ Shards. Going out from under the cover of the roof, you can collect two more\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit and crates will contain two boxes of 10 Flak Shells and\
      \ a box of Razor Blades. Go to the far side of the lawn. At this point, a <a\
      \ href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\">Brute</a> comes stomping out from an area\
      \ to the right. Kill the Brute - you can go into the area from which he emerged\
      \ to grab a Health Pack if you need to.\n</p><p>At this end of the lawn, a ramp\
      \ goes up on to the roof above the sleeping chambers. Climb the ramp, then kill\
      \ the Brute on top. Be careful as you prepare to go through the next entrance\
      \ on the left, because as you go through the entrance, a SkaarjGunner wields\
      \ an Eightball Gun whilst a Nali summons you from a ramp up to the next room.\
      \ Kill the Skaarj but don't follow the Nali yet. Visit alcoves in this room\
      \ for a Flare, a can of 12 Eightballs and a can of Tarydium Sludge.\n</p><p>Return\
      \ to the rooftop and go in the direction of a low-level pointed turret of the\
      \ castle that stands beyond the far side of this flat roof. When you run out\
      \ of flat roof, climb on to the high garden wall. As you approach the turret,\
      \ you will see an entrance into the turret on a walkway below. Get as close\
      \ as possible on top of the garden wall, then run off such that you land on\
      \ the roof of the entrance, where there are two Nali Healing Fruit.\n</p><p>Jump\
      \ down and enter the turret - it is the chapel bell tower. You can collect an\
      \ Assault Vest here, but don't go any further forwards, because you'll fall\
      \ down into the chapel. Instead, return to the walkway outside and follow it\
      \ in either direction (to the right is faster) until you return to the sleeping\
      \ chambers corridor. Go back into the garden and from there back to the room\
      \ where the Nali summoned you.\n</p><p>Join him on the ramp. He leads you up\
      \ the ramp to the room at the top, and opens a section of wall on the right,\
      \ revealing a hidden area containing a Shield Belt and a Super Health Pack.\
      \ Collect, then return to the room outside the secret area.\n</p><p>Time to\
      \ go to the tower now. So, in the room you are now in, climb the wooden staircase.\
      \ It leads you up to a balcony (on which there is a Health Pack) where you can\
      \ catch a lift to a huge spiral stairwell that leads to the tower loft. Start\
      \ your ascent up the long staircase and you will soon meet a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjInfantry</a> with a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"\
      Stinger\">Stinger</a>; kill him and collect the Stinger that he drops. Further\
      \ up, you will come up against a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjOfficer</a> with a GES Biorifle. Kill him too,\
      \ and collect the GES Biorifle that he drops.\n</p><p>Ready your <a href=\"\
      /Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a> now, because at the top\
      \ you'll ride a small lift and enter the tower loft, where you'll have to face\
      \ a Giant Gasbag - kill it quickly because not only does it spit balls of burning\
      \ plasma, it can also spawn new normal Gasbags too.\n</p><p>Once the Giant Gasbag\
      \ is dead, the dungeons should have unlocked. So, go back down the tower stairs\
      \ and return to the room below. If, at the bottom of the stairs, you turn left,\
      \ you can go out on to a pair of rooftops where barrels will reveal two Health\
      \ Packs.\n</p><p>Return to the garden. From there, go back into the sleeping\
      \ chambers corridor and turn left. Left again, and you follow a corridor back\
      \ to the main entrance foyer. Return to the Nali statue's feet and go through\
      \ to the curving staircase down to the dungeon area. Enter the long room at\
      \ the bottom and go down to the lowest level.\n</p><p>Go through the first dungeon\
      \ door on the right, which is now unlocked. Beyond, you are on a staircase that\
      \ curves down to the right into the main body of the next room. Jump first across\
      \ to a ledge ahead to collect two Health Packs, then go down into the room.\n\
      </p><p>Within the room, a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjAssassin</a> will see you and run to a switch which he\
      \ operates, closing some large doors ahead to shut you in. Kill the Skaarj then\
      \ operate the same button to open the doors. Before leaving, you may want to\
      \ go up the other curving staircase down and jump on to the ledge there to get\
      \ another two Health Packs.\n</p><p>Now, go through the large doors you just\
      \ opened, into the dungeon proper. The hall beyond slopes down, leading to a\
      \ junction ahead where chests contain three Flares. At the junction, make a\
      \ right and go down the slope into a cell block. This cell block contains four\
      \ cells which are shut. Two are lit, containing Nali. Press the switch at this\
      \ end of the inner wall to open the cages - the two Nali call something in their\
      \ native tongue and run off back up the entrance hall.\n</p><p>Enter the first\
      \ cell. There's something carved in the wall - read it with the <a href=\"/Universal_Translator\"\
      \ title=\"Universal Translator\">Universal Translator</a> [5].\n</p><p>Sounds\
      \ ominous... Explore the other cells. They are mainly empty but the third cell\
      \ contains a Nali Healing Fruit. On the other side of the dungeon hall, a ramp\
      \ goes down to a large room in the centre of the dungeon. Don't go there yet;\
      \ instead, go back up the entrance hall, across the junction and down into the\
      \ other cell block. The other cell block is guarded by a SkaarjBerserker; kill\
      \ the Skaarj, then activate the switch here to open the cells. All of them are\
      \ empty except for one, which contains a Nali.\n</p><p>Provided that you have\
      \ had a good track record with Nali so far, he will summon you. Follow him,\
      \ and he will lead you on quite a journey. He takes you out of the dungeons\
      \ and through the wooden doors at the end of the room above, and up to the walkway\
      \ round the edge of the castle. He leads you to the cable car that you saw earlier,\
      \ which he activates, taking you across the moat to an entrance in the rock.\
      \ Inside, he leads you up a series of ramps and small rooms that eventually\
      \ comes out on a plateau opposite the castle.\n</p><p>As he steps out on to\
      \ the plateau, a Skaarj scout skimmer similar to the one you saw docked at <a\
      \ href=\"/Outpost_3J\" title=\"Outpost 3J\">Outpost 3J</a> flies by above and\
      \ bombs the unfortunate Nali, blowing him to smithereens. But he's shown you\
      \ what he wanted to show you; on this plateau is a barn with Nali <a href=\"\
      /Cow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cow\">Cows</a> where you can collect some\
      \ stuff.\n</p><p>The barn contains two Nali Healing Fruit, and a barrel within\
      \ contains a Nali Fruit Seed that will be very useful later in the game. When\
      \ you've collected the stuff, return down the ramps to the cable car area. Step\
      \ towards the landing platform and the cable car comes across automatically.\
      \ Back at the castle, return down the steps to the dungeon, and this time go\
      \ to one of the cell blocks and go down the ramp into the big central room.\n\
      </p><p>The large room below is an excecution chamber. Upon your entry, a SkaarjBerserker\
      \ will see you and rush to a switch which he operates to release a guillotine\
      \ on a Nali. When he has done so, he will charge at you. Kill him then look\
      \ around the room.\n</p><p>At one side of the room is a large chopping pendulum.\
      \ Corridors lead downwards on either side of the pendulum, so head for one of\
      \ these. Watch out as you approach the pendulum, because it starts to swing.\
      \ Don't get too close. The corridors lead down to a dungeon room where some\
      \ dead Nali are suspended by chains over some bright red lava; cross the bridge\
      \ from this grisly sight and go into the corridor beyond. Go round the corner\
      \ to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translator_Messages\"\

      \ completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on\
      \ other difficulty settings.''\n\nA large [[Nali]] stronghold stands in a mountain\
      \ valley. You are within breathing distance of the [[Skaarj]] Mothership now,\
      \ although you don't know it yet, and the place is infested with Skaarj and\
      \ their minions. And that's not all...\n\nYou start in the cave you entered\
      \ at the end of the previous map. To the left, there is a pool of water, and\
      \ to the right a cave entrance leading outdoors. Go towards the pool. As you\
      \ approach the pool, a [[Gasbag]] comes down from the ceiling; mow it down with\
      \ an [[Shock Rifle|ASMD]] Combo or two. Dive into the pool and swim to a rock\
      \ at the back, where you can swim out to collect an ASMD clutched by a dead\
      \ Nali.\n\nReturn to dry land and go down the tunnel out of the main cave. Shortly,\
      \ you will arrive on a plateau in front of the Nali castle with an access bridge\
      \ and portcullis ahead.\n\nAs you arrive on the plateau, a [[Krall]] sleeping\
      \ at his post will wake up and make a run for the castle entrance across the\
      \ access bridge. Decapitate him with the [[Sniper Rifle|Rifle]] before he can\
      \ get inside, because if he gets in he'll shut the portcullis on you. As he\
      \ dies, he drops a [[Shield Belt]].\n\nCollect the [[Nali Healing Fruit]] from\
      \ on the left here then go across the bridge, collecting the Shield Belt on\
      \ the way. Go through the castle entrance; follow the corridor beyond and go\
      \ through either of the two sets of doors, then arriving in the main entrance\
      \ foyer.\n\nNote: If you do get locked out, then you will need another way in.\
      \ I am about to explain very quickly how to get in such that you end up in the\
      \ main entrance foyer as above, so if you managed to kill the Krall before he\
      \ could close the portcullis, go to §.\n\nJump off the right hand side of the\
      \ access bridge such that you land in the moat. Swim along in that direction.\
      \ Soon you will see a low balcony round the corner of one of the castle buildings\
      \ lit by a single torch. Swim to the corner of the rock that supports the castle\
      \ and climb out up the slope of the rock just before the rock turns the corner.\
      \ Go up hard against the balcony wall then go up the rock parallel to it. This\
      \ is the only route by which the rock is shallow enough for you to climb out.\
      \ Anyway, when you are high up enough, go over the balcony wall and on to the\
      \ balcony itself (alternatively, you can shoot a grating underwater and gain\
      \ access to the castle from there, but I would recommend taking the route detailed\
      \ here).\n\nFollow the balcony anticlockwise around this part of the castle\
      \ building until you can go in through a door. Inside, you will find a Krall\
      \ in the shadows looking over some beams to a room deeper in the castle; kill\
      \ it. You will also probably have to fight a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker|SkaarjBerserker]]\
      \ who follows you in from outside. When they are dead, climb up the flights\
      \ of wooden steps you are now standing by. At the top, you will come out on\
      \ a higher walkway round the castle. Turn left and follow the walkway round\
      \ the building. When the walkway takes you inside, go to the far side of the\
      \ room and make a right. At the feet of a Nali statue, turn left and immediately\
      \ right such that you come out in a dining hall. Climb the ramp on the left\
      \ in the dining hall and go left again at the top along a corridor, which will\
      \ at last bring you out in the castle's main entrance foyer. You may want to\
      \ go through one of the sets of double doors on the other side to find the Krall\
      \ that locked you out so that you can take his Shield Belt. When you're done,\
      \ return to the foyer.\n\n§ Inside the main entrance foyer, kill the two Krall\
      \ that jump down from balconies on either side, then look around.\n\nFacing\
      \ inwards with a ramp upwards in front of you, there are four routes out of\
      \ this main entrance foyer. There are two on the lower level that you are standing\
      \ on, and two on balconies on either side of the central ramp. Go up the ramp\
      \ and take a left, going round the left balcony and into a corridor beyond.\
      \ Soon you will come to some shut doors with an inscription nearby [1].\n\n\
      Maybe not that way yet then. Return to the balcony and go round to the exit\
      \ on the other side of the balcony level in the foyer. Going through, you will\
      \ arrive on a balcony above the aforementioned chapel. Two Gasbags whom you\
      \ should kill will see you and attack, but after you've killed them, don't drop\
      \ to the chapel floor. I'll be taking you there later instead.\n\nGo back to\
      \ the foyer and drop down to the lower level of the foyer. Take the entrance\
      \ that is on the right when you stand facing the ramp. You will be on a balcony\
      \ with a view of a Nali statue; turn right and enter a small library room there.\
      \ Although the library is empty, there's an open book on a table to the right.\
      \ Read it [2].\n\nSounds interesting... leave the library and return to the\
      \ main entrance foyer. Take the other exit on the lower level. Follow the corridor\
      \ beyond, and you will come out on a balcony above a large dining hall.\n\n\
      Drop down to the floor of the hall. Chests on the left can be opened to reveal\
      \ an ASMD Core and a [[Flashlight]]. Then, do what the book in the library said\
      \ and go to look at the book cases on the far side of the room. One book is\
      \ protruding out of the leftermost case; push it in. The section of wall with\
      \ the two central book cases on swivels round revealing two Krall. Kill the\
      \ Krall. By the time they are dead the book case will probably have swivelled\
      \ back round, so press the book again and this time stand at the central point\
      \ at the base of the swivelling wall after it has swung round once, and it will\
      \ swivel back, taking you with it.\n\nYou will be in a small hidden room with\
      \ a [[Super Health Pack]] and a switch. Take the pack, then press the switch\
      \ to make the wall swivel again. Use it to get back out to the main feast hall.\n\
      Back in the hall, although you could go back up a ramp to the balcony, there's\
      \ a corridor leading off at the ground floor here. So, take the corridor. At\
      \ the end, turn right. After a couple of steps down, you will be in a short\
      \ stretch of corridor where you can open crates for two Health Packs and a box\
      \ of 10 Flak Shells. In doing so, you will attract the attention of a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner|SkaarjGunner]]\
      \ with an [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Gun]] in the room at the far end. Decapitate\
      \ him with some well placed rifle rounds, then climb the steps at the other\
      \ end of the short stretch of corridor. Enter the room the Skaarj was lurking\
      \ in, which is a small kitchen.\n\nCollect the Skaarj's Eightball Gun then look\
      \ around. There are two Nali Fruit [[Seeds]] on the central table, but it's\
      \ too high to jump. So, push one of the barrels in the room up to the table\
      \ and use it as a step. Collect the seeds, then destroy the barrels to get two\
      \ [[Flare|Flares]]. Then, leave the kitchen by a corridor that was to the right\
      \ as you entered. In the area beyond, a flight of steps leads up to a balcony\
      \ above the feast hall. Before climbing the steps, go to the right and destroy\
      \ crates in the shadows for a Health Pack and two cans of 12 Eightballs. Collect\
      \ the [[Energy Amplifier]] in an alcove under the stairs.\n\nGo up the stairs\
      \ on to the balcony and collect of the two cans of 12 Eightballs at the leftermost\
      \ end of the balcony. Drop to the floor of the feast hall and take once again\
      \ the corridor that leaves it at floor level, but this time go left at the end,\
      \ such that you arrive at the feet of the big Nali statue. Go to the right from\
      \ the feet into the small room beyond. You'll pass a door to the chapel on the\
      \ left but we're still not going in there yet; just keep going straight on.\
      \ In the next room, an exit leads on to an outdoor walkway on the left, while\
      \ a flight of steps curves down ahead. Take the steps.\n\nYou will arrive on\
      \ a balcony in a cellar room, where you will be able to hear Krall talking to\
      \ each other. First things first, collect the two boxes of 10 Flak Shells on\
      \ the left and open chests for two more cans of 12 Eightballs. Then, go to the\
      \ edge that this balcony overlooks. Below are two levels of a long room with\
      \ doors on either side. Three Krall are muttering to each other on the top level;\
      \ pummel them with a few pre-loaded Eightballs in a circle.\n\nSome Krall will\
      \ probably get away through the doors at the end of the lower level of this\
      \ area. Don't worry about them, you'll find them again later. Drop down to the\
      \ floor of the the upper level, watching out for a Krall who snipes from some\
      \ beams beyond the lower level doors - that is unless you came in via the moat,\
      \ in which case it'll already be dead.\n\nOn this upper level there are four\
      \ doors. Starting with the first one on the left, go through them clockwise\
      \ one by one. They turn out to be simple sleeping chambers; the first is empty,\
      \ the second contains a dozing [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScout]].\
      \ The third too is empty, but the fourth is more rewarding, containing a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]]\
      \ but also an [[Assault Vest]] behind the bed.\n\nLeave the chambers and drop\
      \ down to the lower level. Doors at the sides are locked, but signs here should\
      \ give you a clue [3].\n\nAt last, you have some direction; you have to go to\
      \ the chapel to unlock the tower, kill a monster of some kind in the tower,\
      \ then come back to the dungeon. So, go through the doors at the end of this\
      \ lower level and into the area beyond.\n\nThe next room is a tall stairwell.\
      \ Wooden flights of steps spiral up to the top; climb them all. There's a walkway\
      \ that leads outside part of the way up but all you will find on that balcony\
      \ is a SkaarjBerserker who may drop down from above if you haven't already encountered\
      \ him by coming in via the moat.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, a stone ramp leads\
      \ outside onto another outdoor balcony. From this point on, keep an eye open\
      \ for any enemies who escaped from the dungeon area earlier as they'll be roaming\
      \ this area. Anyway, step on to the balcony and turn right; you will come to\
      \ a cable car that travels out to an entrance on the other side of the moat,\
      \ but it doesn't move. So, go the other way along the balcony until it leads\
      \ you back inside; you will be back in the room at the top of the curving steps\
      \ down to the dungeon area.\n\nGo to the right then turn right again before\
      \ you reach the Nali statue, so that you come out in the chapel.\n\nGo along\
      \ the red carpet towards a ramp and then go up the ramp (an alcove beneath the\
      \ ramp contains a Health Pack should you need it). At the top, go round the\
      \ back of a small reading pillar and look at it, and you will see a book. Go\
      \ forwards and read the book [4].\n\nAs you approached the reading pillar, a\
      \ button on the front will have been pressed in. The button should have opened\
      \ the way to the tower now, so return to the Nali statue's feet and find your\
      \ way back to the main entrance foyer via the main feast hall. Within the foyer,\
      \ go up the ramp and take the exit from the balcony on the left.\n\nIn the corridor\
      \ beyond, the gate is indeed now open. Climb the slope of the corridor and you\
      \ will be in an upper corridor that stretches off to both the left and right.\
      \ The other wall of this corridor has entrances to several smart sleeping chambers,\
      \ so go to the leftermost end of the corridor and visit the chambers one by\
      \ one.\n\nIn the first chamber, a box by the bed contains a Health Pack. In\
      \ the second chamber, a SkaarjScout is dozing on the bed. Kill him then collect\
      \ the Rifle and box of 8 Rifle Rounds from the bedside box. The third chamber\
      \ is empty, but the box in the fourth chamber contains a can of 12 Eightballs\
      \ and a [[Bio Rifle|GES Biorifle]].\n\nOpposite the door to the fourth chamber\
      \ is an exit to a rooftop garden. Go through into the garden beyond.\n\nAt this\
      \ first end of the garden you can collect two Nali Healing Fruit, and barrels\
      \ contain three clusters of 40 Tayrdium Shards. Going out from under the cover\
      \ of the roof, you can collect two more Nali Healing Fruit and crates will contain\
      \ two boxes of 10 Flak Shells and a box of Razor Blades. Go to the far side\
      \ of the lawn. At this point, a [[Brute]] comes stomping out from an area to\
      \ the right. Kill the Brute - you can go into the area from which he emerged\
      \ to grab a Health Pack if you need to.\n\nAt this end of the lawn, a ramp goes\
      \ up on to the roof above the sleeping chambers. Climb the ramp, then kill the\
      \ Brute on top. Be careful as you prepare to go through the next entrance on\
      \ the left, because as you go through the entrance, a SkaarjGunner wields an\
      \ Eightball Gun whilst a Nali summons you from a ramp up to the next room. Kill\
      \ the Skaarj but don't follow the Nali yet. Visit alcoves in this room for a\
      \ Flare, a can of 12 Eightballs and a can of Tarydium Sludge.\n\nReturn to the\
      \ rooftop and go in the direction of a low-level pointed turret of the castle\
      \ that stands beyond the far side of this flat roof. When you run out of flat\
      \ roof, climb on to the high garden wall. As you approach the turret, you will\
      \ see an entrance into the turret on a walkway below. Get as close as possible\
      \ on top of the garden wall, then run off such that you land on the roof of\
      \ the entrance, where there are two Nali Healing Fruit.\n\nJump down and enter\
      \ the turret - it is the chapel bell tower. You can collect an Assault Vest\
      \ here, but don't go any further forwards, because you'll fall down into the\
      \ chapel. Instead, return to the walkway outside and follow it in either direction\
      \ (to the right is faster) until you return to the sleeping chambers corridor.\
      \ Go back into the garden and from there back to the room where the Nali summoned\
      \ you.\n\nJoin him on the ramp. He leads you up the ramp to the room at the\
      \ top, and opens a section of wall on the right, revealing a hidden area containing\
      \ a Shield Belt and a Super Health Pack. Collect, then return to the room outside\
      \ the secret area.\n\nTime to go to the tower now. So, in the room you are now\
      \ in, climb the wooden staircase. It leads you up to a balcony (on which there\
      \ is a Health Pack) where you can catch a lift to a huge spiral stairwell that\
      \ leads to the tower loft. Start your ascent up the long staircase and you will\
      \ soon meet a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry|SkaarjInfantry]] with a [[Stinger]];\
      \ kill him and collect the Stinger that he drops. Further up, you will come\
      \ up against a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer|SkaarjOfficer]] with a GES Biorifle.\
      \ Kill him too, and collect the GES Biorifle that he drops.\n\nReady your [[Flak\
      \ Cannon]] now, because at the top you'll ride a small lift and enter the tower\
      \ loft, where you'll have to face a Giant Gasbag - kill it quickly because not\
      \ only does it spit balls of burning plasma, it can also spawn new normal Gasbags\
      \ too.\n\nOnce the Giant Gasbag is dead, the dungeons should have unlocked.\
      \ So, go back down the tower stairs and return to the room below. If, at the\
      \ bottom of the stairs, you turn left, you can go out on to a pair of rooftops\
      \ where barrels will reveal two Health Packs.\n\nReturn to the garden. From\
      \ there, go back into the sleeping chambers corridor and turn left. Left again,\
      \ and you follow a corridor back to the main entrance foyer. Return to the Nali\
      \ statue's feet and go through to the curving staircase down to the dungeon\
      \ area. Enter the long room at the bottom and go down to the lowest level.\n\
      \nGo through the first dungeon door on the right, which is now unlocked. Beyond,\
      \ you are on a staircase that curves down to the right into the main body of\
      \ the next room. Jump first across to a ledge ahead to collect two Health Packs,\
      \ then go down into the room.\n\nWithin the room, a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin|SkaarjAssassin]]\
      \ will see you and run to a switch which he operates, closing some large doors\
      \ ahead to shut you in. Kill the Skaarj then operate the same button to open\
      \ the doors. Before leaving, you may want to go up the other curving staircase\
      \ down and jump on to the ledge there to get another two Health Packs.\n\nNow,\
      \ go through the large doors you just opened, into the dungeon proper. The hall\
      \ beyond slopes down, leading to a junction ahead where chests contain three\
      \ Flares. At the junction, make a right and go down the slope into a cell block.\
      \ This cell block contains four cells which are shut. Two are lit, containing\
      \ Nali. Press the switch at this end of the inner wall to open the cages - the\
      \ two Nali call something in their native tongue and run off back up the entrance\
      \ hall.\n\nEnter the first cell. There's something carved in the wall - read\
      \ it with the [[Universal Translator]] [5].\n\nSounds ominous... Explore the\
      \ other cells. They are mainly empty but the third cell contains a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit. On the other side of the dungeon hall, a ramp goes down to a large\
      \ room in the centre of the dungeon. Don't go there yet; instead, go back up\
      \ the entrance hall, across the junction and down into the other cell block.\
      \ The other cell block is guarded by a SkaarjBerserker; kill the Skaarj, then\
      \ activate the switch here to open the cells. All of them are empty except for\
      \ one, which contains a Nali.\n\nProvided that you have had a good track record\
      \ with Nali so far, he will summon you. Follow him, and he will lead you on\
      \ quite a journey. He takes you out of the dungeons and through the wooden doors\
      \ at the end of the room above, and up to the walkway round the edge of the\
      \ castle. He leads you to the cable car that you saw earlier, which he activates,\
      \ taking you across the moat to an entrance in the rock. Inside, he leads you\
      \ up a series of ramps and small rooms that eventually comes out on a plateau\
      \ opposite the castle.\n\nAs he steps out on to the plateau, a Skaarj scout\
      \ skimmer similar to the one you saw docked at [[Outpost 3J]] flies by above\
      \ and bombs the unfortunate Nali, blowing him to smithereens. But he's shown\
      \ you what he wanted to show you; on this plateau is a barn with Nali [[Cow|Cows]]\
      \ where you can collect some stuff.\n\nThe barn contains two Nali Healing Fruit,\
      \ and a barrel within contains a Nali Fruit Seed that will be very useful later\
      \ in the game. When you've collected the stuff, return down the ramps to the\
      \ cable car area. Step towards the landing platform and the cable car comes\
      \ across automatically. Back at the castle, return down the steps to the dungeon,\
      \ and this time go to one of the cell blocks and go down the ramp into the big\
      \ central room.\n\nThe large room below is an excecution chamber. Upon your\
      \ entry, a SkaarjBerserker will see you and rush to a switch which he operates\
      \ to release a guillotine on a Nali. When he has done so, he will charge at\
      \ you. Kill him then look around the room.\n\nAt one side of the room is a large\
      \ chopping pendulum. Corridors lead downwards on either side of the pendulum,\
      \ so head for one of these. Watch out as you approach the pendulum, because\
      \ it starts to swing. Don't get too close. The corridors lead down to a dungeon\
      \ room where some dead Nali are suspended by chains over some bright red lava;\
      \ cross the bridge from this grisly sight and go into the corridor beyond. Go\
      \ round the corner to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"Only the\
