      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Beyond <a href=\"/Terraniux\" title=\"Terraniux\">Terraniux</a> and <a\
      \ href=\"/Noork%27s_Elbow\" title=\"Noork's Elbow\">Noork's Elbow</a> lies the\
      \ once stately Temple of Vandora, the Nali goddess of lightning. This temple,\
      \ though evidently still used up to the point at which it was overrun by the\
      \ Skaarj, seems damaged, almost ruined. Somehow that just doesn't follow.\n\
      </p><p>You start in whichever staircase you left Noork's Elbow by. The staircases\
      \ sweep up round in a curve. If you follow your staircase, you will reach a\
      \ crossroads.\n</p><p>At this crossroads, go first down the steps towards the\
      \ locked main front doors. Niches here contain an <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\"\
      \ title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a> and a can of 12 Eightballs. Collect\
      \ what you require, then back up the steps, across the crossroads and through\
      \ a doorway to an outside area.\n</p><p>As you go into the damaged outdoor area,\
      \ which has three exits (including your entrance) and a similar number of <a\
      \ href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a>,\
      \ you will be barred into this area as you are attacked by three small but fast\
      \ <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"Manta\">CaveMantas</a> and a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjScout</a> from above. Kill 'em all.\n</p><p>When\
      \ the SkaarjScout is dead, the two end exits will be opened, leaving the side\
      \ exit locked. Go first back through the doorway you came through and shine\
      \ a light into the shadowy corner on the left; you will see a ramp that you\
      \ can climb to get up on to the SkaarjScout's balcony, where there is a can\
      \ of 12 Eightballs.\n</p><p>Return to the floor of outdoor area and take the\
      \ other open exit now. You will be in a junction with a Stinger by a human corpse\
      \ and a <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\">LesserBrute</a> who attacks from\
      \ the right. Kill the LesserBrute, then go up his corridor. You will see a barred\
      \ exit to a small outdoor valley, but the bars won't budge, so you'll have to\
      \ take the other route.\n</p><p>Stairs will spiral down to a pool at the bottom.\
      \ A Nali here will summon you - unless the Nali in Noork's Elbow was killed\
      \ that is, in which event he may be fearful and bowing.\n</p><p>You have to\
      \ clear the area before following the Nali, so descend the stairs partly and\
      \ hop across to the corridor at the bottom without getting close enough to start\
      \ him on his run. Follow the corridor into an area where a SkaarjScout whom\
      \ you should kill is on patrol. Then, make a left and follow the corridors into\
      \ a room with an altar and huge, cyan blue torches at the top of a flight of\
      \ stairs. Go up the steps and kill the huge, angry <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjBerserker</a> who jumps down from a balcony\
      \ above.\n</p><p>Return to the Nali and follow him now. He will lead you to\
      \ a secret door which he opens to reveal a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a> (don't collect\
      \ it yet as you are about to get another and this one is more accessible), then\
      \ he will lead you up to the altar with the two cyan blue torches. Go behind\
      \ the altar to get a can of 12 Eightballs and two Nali Healing Fruit.\n</p><p>Go\
      \ back to the room where you met the SkaarjScout, via Tarydium Shards in the\
      \ connecting corridor, and shoot open the chest in this area to reveal a 25kg\
      \ can of Tarydium Sludge. Then, since you are now relatively free to roam at\
      \ your leisure, return to the staircase where you first encountered that Nali.\n\
      </p><p>Alcoves around the staircase contain a Nali Healing Fruit and two <a\
      \ href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flares</a>. By the pool at ground level are\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit and a can of 12 Eightballs. Collect what you need, then\
      \ dive into the pool.\n</p><p>Kill any <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\"\
      >Devilfish</a> you find swimming here and descend until you see a tunnel off\
      \ to the side. Enter this natural earth tunnel and follow it. You will soon\
      \ see bars blocking the tunnel ahead, but look carefully and you will see an\
      \ opening in the earth to the right. Go through and surface in a small cave\
      \ where there is a Super Health Pack and a <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol_Powerup\"\
      \ title=\"Dispersion Pistol Powerup\">Dispersion Pistol Powerup</a>. Collect,\
      \ then return to the main pool and climb out. Follow the corridor once more,\
      \ coming again to the junction room where you killed the SkaarjScout.\n</p><p>Make\
      \ a right this time and follow the next area, until you come to a flight of\
      \ steps down to the left and doors to a sleeping chamber on the right. Enter\
      \ the sleeping chamber but watch out for the <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjTrooper</a> who grabs a <a href=\"/Bio_Rifle\"\
      \ title=\"Bio Rifle\">GES Biorifle</a> and starts hurling goop at you. Your\
      \ <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a>\
      \ is quite powerful now (mine was power 4) so try it out...\n</p><p>Kill the\
      \ Trooper and collect the GES Biorifle as he drops it. Then, raid the bunks\
      \ for other goodies including 12 Eightballs and two clusters of 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards. A chest here contains a useful box of 10 Flak Shells. Now, leave and\
      \ descend the sweeping steps opposite; soon, as you pass a Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ in the corridor, you can enter another sleeping chamber on the left with an\
      \ <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault\
      \ Vest</a> plus chests containing a Flare and 25 Kilos of Tarydium Sludge. Collect\
      \ and leave the chamber.\n</p><p>Take a left and go through into a room lit\
      \ by a red torch on the wall. You will probably be spotted by a SkaarjScout\
      \ patrolling the balcony here, so dispose of it with a suitable implement of\
      \ destruction. Nothing else of interest in this area, so go down the steps ahead\
      \ into the next one.\nYou will see water ahead and steps to the right. If you\
      \ go straight on at this point you will be ambushed, so instead climb the steps\
      \ and kill the <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\"\
      >SkaarjWarrior</a> lurking on the balcony. Whilst on the balcony, collect the\
      \ Tarydium Shards here and look at the barred entrance here. Read the nearby\
      \ sign [1].\n</p><p>Well, nowhere to go up here, so go back down the steps and\
      \ along towards the water.\n</p><p>You will be in a kind of indoor dock; there\
      \ is a boat tethered to a jetty, which you will use in due course, but first\
      \ go towards the far end of the dock (there is a Nali Healing Fruit on the way\
      \ if you need it) and through the short dark corridor at the far end to deal\
      \ with an ambush lurking over the water. There are two airborne <a href=\"/Gasbag\"\
      \ title=\"Gasbag\">Gasbags</a> here. They have a powerful attack and can dodge\
      \ projectiles, but on Medium skill are still succeptible to a single well-placed\
      \ <a href=\"/ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a> Combo. Kill\
      \ these Gasbags and return to the boat, then climb aboard and enjoy the ride...\n\
      </p><p>After a short trip round the pool you will land at another small jetty\
      \ on which there are empty barrels. Climb onto the main stone floor via the\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit here. Collect from this immediate area a can of 12 Eightballs\
      \ and a box of Razor Blades (<a href=\"/Razorjack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Razorjack\">Razorjack</a> ammo).\n</p><p>On this stone platform there is a door\
      \ into a large pillared room, and a stone bridge across the water. Cross the\
      \ bridge and you will see closed gates ahead with a sign above [2].\n</p><p>Locked.\
      \ So, cross the bridge again and enter the large room. At the far end of this\
      \ room is a button and two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards; collect the shards\
      \ but don't press the button yet. A SkaarjWarrior is on patrol on a walkway\
      \ above you at this end of the room. Kill the Skaarj then collect the ASMD that\
      \ he drops. Then, climb either of the ramps behind the pillars up on to the\
      \ walkway. There is a sleeping chamber on either side of the room here; go first\
      \ to the one on the right and open the doors.\n</p><p>Inside, a SkaarjTrooper\
      \ wields a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a>. Kill the Skaarj\
      \ and collect the Stinger that he drops, then raid containers to get a Nali\
      \ Fruit Seed. If you investigate the bunks you will find a <a href=\"/Flashlight\"\
      \ title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a> and an ASMD Core. Go along to the other\
      \ sleeping chamber and kill the SkaarjTrooper here who has nothing more than\
      \ a Dispersion Pistol. Collect <a href=\"/Bandages\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Bandages\">Bandages</a> from a table and a Health Pack from a bunk.\n</p><p>Return\
      \ to the large room with pillars and now press the button. Gates open from in\
      \ front of the Torch of Tranquility over the bridge. Leave the room and cross\
      \ the bridge, but watch out for the badass SkaarjBerserker who has spawned here.\n\
      </p><p>Approach the now revealed but dead torch and press the floor plate. A\
      \ bolt of purple comes down and strikes the torch, which erupts in a huge purple\
      \ flame, to the accompaniment of an earth tremor.\n</p><p>You are ready to move\
      \ on now, but first collect the Health Pack and Force Field from behind the\
      \ Torch of Tranquility. Make your own way back to the dock, either by the water\
      \ or by following the stone walkway clockwise round the pool (anticlockwise\
      \ is a dead end). If you enter the water, watch out for Devilfish; note that\
      \ for each one killed another is spawned.\n</p><p>Back at the dock, go underwater.\
      \ An underwater tunnel beneath the jetty leads to a cubby-hole where you can\
      \ surface to collect a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>\
      \ from a dead Nali. Return to the dock, then climb out and go back up the steps\
      \ to the entrance that was barred before.\n</p><p>It is open now. Go in and\
      \ collect the box of 50 Bullets from behind a pillar to the right, then descend\
      \ the steps on the left and go round and into one last sleeping chamber. From\
      \ this chamber you can get a Nali Healing Fruit and a very useful <a href=\"\
      /Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>.\n\
      </p><p>Go back up the steps and through to the left, into a hall where a SkaarjBerserker\
      \ shuts you in then attacks. Flak it, and collect the Eightballs it drops. If\
      \ you go to the foot of a staircase through an opening to one side, the staircase\
      \ is blocked by bars, but you can get a Nali Healing Fruit.\nGo up the other\
      \ staircase, i.e. the one that curves round to the right. You will cross the\
      \ balcony in the red torch room, then you will follow some more steps into another\
      \ room.\n</p><p>Collect Flares from the tables in this room, then investigate\
      \ an entrance that doubles back on the way you came in. Follow this short corridor\
      \ round to the left into a small area where you will be met by a <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjInfantry</a>\
      \ (visually indistinguishable from a SkaarjTrooper) armed with a Stinger. Kill\
      \ him and take his gun, then have a look around.\n</p><p>Ahead is a fountain.\
      \ To the right is an inscription [3].\n</p><p>Very mysterious. Well, do as the\
      \ inscription says, and kiss the fountain with fire, i.e. toss a Flare into\
      \ the water. Doors nearby slide open to reveal a powerful <a href=\"/Invisibility\"\
      \ title=\"Invisibility\">Invisibility</a> inventory item. Use the Invisibility\
      \ item with care, as it is valuable and its power limited.\n</p><p>Return to\
      \ the main room and climb the steps upward. Double back at the top along a ledge\
      \ if you need a Nali Healing Fruit. From the top of the steps, follow a short\
      \ corridor to the left to emerge on the balcony above the shrine with the cyan\
      \ blue torches.\n</p><p>A huge image of a four-armed winged goddess dominating\
      \ the end wall carries a message [4].\n</p><p>Ahead, beyond an <a href=\"/Energy_Amplifier\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Energy Amplifier\">Energy Amplifier</a> and\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit, is the barred exit to the open area where you were ambushed\
      \ by a SkaarjScout earlier. Walk up to the bars and they will open now - avoid\
      \ the amplifier and use up your old one before collecting the new if you still\
      \ have it. Go outside, where a Brute attacks you. Kill it, then go back towards\
      \ the temple via the door on the left from the entrance you just came through.\
      \ In the junction within, turn right to the previously barred off hill valley.\n\
      </p><p>Kill the LesserBrute guarding this exit then venture outside, where a\
      \ SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol is on patrol. As you go along the valley,\
      \ you can turn down a pass to the right to find two Nali Healing Fruit and a\
      \ natural pool. The pool itself contains nothing useful, just a virtually endless\
      \ supply of Devilfish that it's not worth wasting your ammo on. Return to the\
      \ main valley.\n</p><p>Continuing round the valley, you will pass an irrelevant\
      \ Nali <a href=\"/Cow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Cow\">Cow</a> with its\
      \ equally irrelevant Nali Calf. These livestock animals can safely be ignored.\
      \ What you can do however is collect a Nali Healing Fruit from near where they\
      \ are standing. At the end of the valley, you will find a distinctive blue-clad\
      \ <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjGunner</a>,\
      \ but consider yourself lucky; this one only has a Dispersion Pistol. The Skaarj\
      \ was guarding another entrance in the rock, so when it has been killed, collect\
      \ the Eightballs here then go in.\n</p><p>The lift on the right here is blocked\

      \ route into the final room (its purpose is for Coop games), so ignore it. Go\
      \ left instead, and kill the Brute on guard round the corner. Save your game\

      \ a large outdoor amphitheatre... with a <a href=\"/Titan\" title=\"Titan\"\
      >Titan</a> on stage! The amphitheatre is littered with Nali Healing Fruit, but\
      \ collecting health is a dangerous distraction in Titan fights, so simply use\
      \ your strafing to avoid its boulders - watch out for rebounding rocks - and\
      \ pelt it with Eightballs in clusters, staying on the top level of the amphitheatre\
      \ if possible.\n</p><p>When the Titan is finally dead, doors open at the back\
      \ of the arena. Collect any health you need, then go through the corridor beyond.\
      \ The ground will start to shake but keep going so that you don't get trapped\
      \ as the ceiling falls in.In the corridor beyond the rock fall, go along to\
      \ the right to exit the level.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \nBeyond [[Terraniux]] and [[Noork's Elbow]] lies the once stately Temple of\
      \ Vandora, the Nali goddess of lightning. This temple, though evidently still\
      \ used up to the point at which it was overrun by the Skaarj, seems damaged,\
      \ almost ruined. Somehow that just doesn't follow.\n\nYou start in whichever\
      \ staircase you left Noork's Elbow by. The staircases sweep up round in a curve.\
      \ If you follow your staircase, you will reach a crossroads.\n\nAt this crossroads,\
      \ go first down the steps towards the locked main front doors. Niches here contain\
      \ an [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Gun]] and a can of 12 Eightballs. Collect what\
      \ you require, then back up the steps, across the crossroads and through a doorway\
      \ to an outside area.\n\nAs you go into the damaged outdoor area, which has\
      \ three exits (including your entrance) and a similar number of [[Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit]], you will be barred into this area as you are attacked by three small\
      \ but fast [[Manta|CaveMantas]] and a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Scout|SkaarjScout]]\
      \ from above. Kill 'em all.\n\nWhen the SkaarjScout is dead, the two end exits\
      \ will be opened, leaving the side exit locked. Go first back through the doorway\
      \ you came through and shine a light into the shadowy corner on the left; you\
      \ will see a ramp that you can climb to get up on to the SkaarjScout's balcony,\
      \ where there is a can of 12 Eightballs.\n\nReturn to the floor of outdoor area\
      \ and take the other open exit now. You will be in a junction with a Stinger\
      \ by a human corpse and a [[Brute|LesserBrute]] who attacks from the right.\
      \ Kill the LesserBrute, then go up his corridor. You will see a barred exit\
      \ to a small outdoor valley, but the bars won't budge, so you'll have to take\
      \ the other route.\n\nStairs will spiral down to a pool at the bottom. A Nali\
      \ here will summon you - unless the Nali in Noork's Elbow was killed that is,\
      \ in which event he may be fearful and bowing.\n\nYou have to clear the area\
      \ before following the Nali, so descend the stairs partly and hop across to\
      \ the corridor at the bottom without getting close enough to start him on his\
      \ run. Follow the corridor into an area where a SkaarjScout whom you should\
      \ kill is on patrol. Then, make a left and follow the corridors into a room\
      \ with an altar and huge, cyan blue torches at the top of a flight of stairs.\
      \ Go up the steps and kill the huge, angry [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker|SkaarjBerserker]]\
      \ who jumps down from a balcony above.\n\nReturn to the Nali and follow him\
      \ now. He will lead you to a secret door which he opens to reveal a [[Super\
      \ Health Pack]] (don't collect it yet as you are about to get another and this\
      \ one is more accessible), then he will lead you up to the altar with the two\
      \ cyan blue torches. Go behind the altar to get a can of 12 Eightballs and two\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit.\n\nGo back to the room where you met the SkaarjScout,\
      \ via Tarydium Shards in the connecting corridor, and shoot open the chest in\
      \ this area to reveal a 25kg can of Tarydium Sludge. Then, since you are now\
      \ relatively free to roam at your leisure, return to the staircase where you\
      \ first encountered that Nali.\n\nAlcoves around the staircase contain a Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit and two [[Flare|Flares]]. By the pool at ground level are a\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit and a can of 12 Eightballs. Collect what you need, then\
      \ dive into the pool.\n\nKill any [[Devilfish]] you find swimming here and descend\
      \ until you see a tunnel off to the side. Enter this natural earth tunnel and\
      \ follow it. You will soon see bars blocking the tunnel ahead, but look carefully\
      \ and you will see an opening in the earth to the right. Go through and surface\
      \ in a small cave where there is a Super Health Pack and a [[Dispersion Pistol\
      \ Powerup]]. Collect, then return to the main pool and climb out. Follow the\
      \ corridor once more, coming again to the junction room where you killed the\
      \ SkaarjScout.\n\nMake a right this time and follow the next area, until you\
      \ come to a flight of steps down to the left and doors to a sleeping chamber\
      \ on the right. Enter the sleeping chamber but watch out for the [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper|SkaarjTrooper]]\
      \ who grabs a [[Bio Rifle|GES Biorifle]] and starts hurling goop at you. Your\
      \ [[Dispersion Pistol]] is quite powerful now (mine was power 4) so try it out...\n\
      \nKill the Trooper and collect the GES Biorifle as he drops it. Then, raid the\
      \ bunks for other goodies including 12 Eightballs and two clusters of 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards. A chest here contains a useful box of 10 Flak Shells. Now, leave and\
      \ descend the sweeping steps opposite; soon, as you pass a Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ in the corridor, you can enter another sleeping chamber on the left with an\
      \ [[Assault Vest]] plus chests containing a Flare and 25 Kilos of Tarydium Sludge.\
      \ Collect and leave the chamber.\n\nTake a left and go through into a room lit\
      \ by a red torch on the wall. You will probably be spotted by a SkaarjScout\
      \ patrolling the balcony here, so dispose of it with a suitable implement of\
      \ destruction. Nothing else of interest in this area, so go down the steps ahead\
      \ into the next one.\nYou will see water ahead and steps to the right. If you\
      \ go straight on at this point you will be ambushed, so instead climb the steps\
      \ and kill the [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]] lurking on the\
      \ balcony. Whilst on the balcony, collect the Tarydium Shards here and look\
      \ at the barred entrance here. Read the nearby sign [1].\n\nWell, nowhere to\
      \ go up here, so go back down the steps and along towards the water.\n\nYou\
      \ will be in a kind of indoor dock; there is a boat tethered to a jetty, which\
      \ you will use in due course, but first go towards the far end of the dock (there\
      \ is a Nali Healing Fruit on the way if you need it) and through the short dark\
      \ corridor at the far end to deal with an ambush lurking over the water. There\
      \ are two airborne [[Gasbag|Gasbags]] here. They have a powerful attack and\
      \ can dodge projectiles, but on Medium skill are still succeptible to a single\
      \ well-placed [[ASMD]] Combo. Kill these Gasbags and return to the boat, then\
      \ climb aboard and enjoy the ride...\n\nAfter a short trip round the pool you\
      \ will land at another small jetty on which there are empty barrels. Climb onto\
      \ the main stone floor via the Nali Healing Fruit here. Collect from this immediate\
      \ area a can of 12 Eightballs and a box of Razor Blades ([[Razorjack]] ammo).\n\
      \nOn this stone platform there is a door into a large pillared room, and a stone\
      \ bridge across the water. Cross the bridge and you will see closed gates ahead\
      \ with a sign above [2].\n\nLocked. So, cross the bridge again and enter the\
      \ large room. At the far end of this room is a button and two clusters of 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards; collect the shards but don't press the button yet. A SkaarjWarrior\
      \ is on patrol on a walkway above you at this end of the room. Kill the Skaarj\
      \ then collect the ASMD that he drops. Then, climb either of the ramps behind\
      \ the pillars up on to the walkway. There is a sleeping chamber on either side\
      \ of the room here; go first to the one on the right and open the doors.\n\n\
      Inside, a SkaarjTrooper wields a [[Stinger]]. Kill the Skaarj and collect the\
      \ Stinger that he drops, then raid containers to get a Nali Fruit Seed. If you\
      \ investigate the bunks you will find a [[Flashlight]] and an ASMD Core. Go\
      \ along to the other sleeping chamber and kill the SkaarjTrooper here who has\
      \ nothing more than a Dispersion Pistol. Collect [[Bandages]] from a table and\
      \ a Health Pack from a bunk.\n\nReturn to the large room with pillars and now\
      \ press the button. Gates open from in front of the Torch of Tranquility over\
      \ the bridge. Leave the room and cross the bridge, but watch out for the badass\
      \ SkaarjBerserker who has spawned here.\n\nApproach the now revealed but dead\
      \ torch and press the floor plate. A bolt of purple comes down and strikes the\
      \ torch, which erupts in a huge purple flame, to the accompaniment of an earth\
      \ tremor.\n\nYou are ready to move on now, but first collect the Health Pack\
      \ and Force Field from behind the Torch of Tranquility. Make your own way back\
      \ to the dock, either by the water or by following the stone walkway clockwise\
      \ round the pool (anticlockwise is a dead end). If you enter the water, watch\
      \ out for Devilfish; note that for each one killed another is spawned.\n\nBack\
      \ at the dock, go underwater. An underwater tunnel beneath the jetty leads to\
      \ a cubby-hole where you can surface to collect a [[Flak Cannon]] from a dead\
      \ Nali. Return to the dock, then climb out and go back up the steps to the entrance\
      \ that was barred before.\n\nIt is open now. Go in and collect the box of 50\
      \ Bullets from behind a pillar to the right, then descend the steps on the left\
      \ and go round and into one last sleeping chamber. From this chamber you can\
      \ get a Nali Healing Fruit and a very useful [[Shield Belt]].\n\nGo back up\
      \ the steps and through to the left, into a hall where a SkaarjBerserker shuts\
      \ you in then attacks. Flak it, and collect the Eightballs it drops. If you\
      \ go to the foot of a staircase through an opening to one side, the staircase\
      \ is blocked by bars, but you can get a Nali Healing Fruit.\nGo up the other\
      \ staircase, i.e. the one that curves round to the right. You will cross the\
      \ balcony in the red torch room, then you will follow some more steps into another\
      \ room.\n\nCollect Flares from the tables in this room, then investigate an\
      \ entrance that doubles back on the way you came in. Follow this short corridor\
      \ round to the left into a small area where you will be met by a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry|SkaarjInfantry]]\
      \ (visually indistinguishable from a SkaarjTrooper) armed with a Stinger. Kill\
      \ him and take his gun, then have a look around.\n\nAhead is a fountain. To\
      \ the right is an inscription [3].\n\nVery mysterious. Well, do as the inscription\
      \ says, and kiss the fountain with fire, i.e. toss a Flare into the water. Doors\
      \ nearby slide open to reveal a powerful [[Invisibility]] inventory item. Use\
      \ the Invisibility item with care, as it is valuable and its power limited.\n\
      \nReturn to the main room and climb the steps upward. Double back at the top\
      \ along a ledge if you need a Nali Healing Fruit. From the top of the steps,\
      \ follow a short corridor to the left to emerge on the balcony above the shrine\
      \ with the cyan blue torches.\n\nA huge image of a four-armed winged goddess\
      \ dominating the end wall carries a message [4].\n\nAhead, beyond an [[Energy\
      \ Amplifier]] and a Nali Healing Fruit, is the barred exit to the open area\
      \ where you were ambushed by a SkaarjScout earlier. Walk up to the bars and\
      \ they will open now - avoid the amplifier and use up your old one before collecting\
      \ the new if you still have it. Go outside, where a Brute attacks you. Kill\
      \ it, then go back towards the temple via the door on the left from the entrance\
      \ you just came through. In the junction within, turn right to the previously\
      \ barred off hill valley.\n\nKill the LesserBrute guarding this exit then venture\
      \ outside, where a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol is on patrol. As you\
      \ go along the valley, you can turn down a pass to the right to find two Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit and a natural pool. The pool itself contains nothing useful,\
      \ just a virtually endless supply of Devilfish that it's not worth wasting your\
      \ ammo on. Return to the main valley.\n\nContinuing round the valley, you will\
      \ pass an irrelevant Nali [[Cow]] with its equally irrelevant Nali Calf. These\
      \ livestock animals can safely be ignored. What you can do however is collect\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit from near where they are standing. At the end of the\
      \ valley, you will find a distinctive blue-clad [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner|SkaarjGunner]],\
      \ but consider yourself lucky; this one only has a Dispersion Pistol. The Skaarj\
      \ was guarding another entrance in the rock, so when it has been killed, collect\
      \ the Eightballs here then go in.\n\nThe lift on the right here is blocked at\
      \ the top until the final battle, and even then it is only an alternative route\
      \ into the final room (its purpose is for Coop games), so ignore it. Go left\
      \ instead, and kill the Brute on guard round the corner. Save your game now...\n\
      \nAs you step out of the corridor, you will be barred off into a large outdoor\
      \ amphitheatre... with a [[Titan]] on stage! The amphitheatre is littered with\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit, but collecting health is a dangerous distraction in Titan\
      \ fights, so simply use your strafing to avoid its boulders - watch out for\
      \ rebounding rocks - and pelt it with Eightballs in clusters, staying on the\
      \ top level of the amphitheatre if possible.\n\nWhen the Titan is finally dead,\
      \ doors open at the back of the arena. Collect any health you need, then go\
      \ through the corridor beyond. The ground will start to shake but keep going\
      \ so that you don't get trapped as the ceiling falls in.In the corridor beyond\
      \ the rock fall, go along to the right to exit the level.\n\n\n==Translator\
