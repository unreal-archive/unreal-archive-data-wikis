      \ Pali</a>, that has been enslaved by the <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\"\
      >Skaarj</a> Empire. They appear in two variations, regular Nali, sometimes referred\
      \ to as monks, and more colorfully painted Nali Priests that tend to show up\
      \ in areas of religious importance. Most Nali serve in the <a href=\"/Rrajigar_Mine\"\
      \ title=\"Rrajigar Mine\">mines</a>, digging out the incredibly valuable <a\
      \ href=\"/Tarydium\" title=\"Tarydium\">Tarydium</a> crystals. On average, a\
      \ Nali is 8 feet tall and weighs 165 lbs.\n</p><p>The Nali themselves are mostly\
      \ passive, though some still have enough will to rebel. Nali corpses have been\
      \ discovered on Na Pali with weapons nearby, suggesting that some Nali are attempting\
      \ outright rebellion against their Skaarj oppressors. Other Nali have been reported\
      \ to aid offworld visitors in exchange for protection. A Nali so inclined would\
      \ beckon with their lower arms and say, \"<i>Batai d'va</i>\". The Skaarj were\
      \ often aware of these insurrections and would lay an ambush for both the Nali\
      \ and their would-be helpers. Nali diaries discovered on the planet's surface\

      \ progression going on throughout the Nali's religious structures, and the extent\
      \ to which their belief system is true is difficult to ascertain. The <a href=\"\
      /Chizra_-_Nali_Water_God\" title=\"Chizra - Nali Water God\">Temple of Chizra</a>,\
      \ for example, is an extensive temple devoted to the Nali Water God. Among other\
      \ temples are the <a href=\"/Temple_of_Vandora\" title=\"Temple of Vandora\"\
      >Temple of Vandora</a>, the Goddess of Lightning; and the <a href=\"/Velora_Pass\"\
      \ title=\"Velora Pass\">Temple of Velora</a>. It is not clear what Velora is\
      \ the goddess of, though she is always associated with trials and deadly traps.\
      \ Velora and Chrizra seem to resemble Mayan or Aztec gods from planet Earth,\
      \ depicted in wall-carvings and relief statues. They tend to be associated with\
      \ large yellow bricks and wood as building materials, and always have plenty\
      \ of water in their temples.\n</p><p>Vandora's temple seems more Gothic in design,\
      \ and the depiction of Vandora herself appears closer, perhaps, to Greek or\
      \ Roman depictions of deities than Velora or Chizra. There is a quote supposedly\
      \ from Vandora herself written on the walls in one chamber of her temple that\
      \ reads: \"<i>And Vandora came down, with fire from the sky upon her wings,\
      \ and sanctified the holy fountain with her kiss. Thus, she said, whoever follows\
      \ me shall cast off the bonds of flesh and become as elusive as the mist.</i>\"\
      \ What is most striking about Vandora is that her basic structure is human.\
      \ She bears four arms, and a pair of feathered wings, but otherwise she is human,\
      \ suggesting that she was, perhaps, a survivor of a crash landing farther back\
      \ in Nali history who made a significant enough impression on the Nali that\
      \ they revered her as a Goddess. Further research into Nali mysticism suggests\
      \ a strong correlation with encounters with offworlders that defy anything else\
      \ existing in their culture. Nali often revere alien crafts that land or crash\
      \ on their planet, calling them chariots from the stars and the like. A standard-issue\
      \ <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Launcher</a>\
      \ is referred to by the Nali as the \"Stick of Six Fires\".\n</p><p>However,\
      \ the Nali religion is not entirely discounted as misinterpretation. In the\
      \ Temple of Chizra, there was discovered a documented account of Nali lore:\
      \ \"<i>Look into your own eyes, and when your courage is strongest your last\
      \ step toward the prize will be upheld by your faith.</i>\" Behind a hidden\
      \ wall there is a pit with an obelisk of sorts in the middle and a walkway surrounding\
      \ it. Around the backside of the obelisk is a mirror, in front of which floats\
      \ a shield belt. There are unconfirmed reports that it is in fact possible to\
      \ walk unimpeded across the pit and obtain that belt. Nali will occasionally\
      \ speak of their dreams, or make prophecies that end up coming true, in one\
      \ way or another. Eventually, it is never entirely sure how much truth there\
      \ actually is to the Nali religion, and how much is based on exposure to extraterrestrial\
      \ elements.\n</p><p>The Nali religion itself seems to be in the middle of a\
      \ transformation. The Chizra and Velora temples seem to be in the most disrepair,\
      \ whereas the Vandora temple seems slightly more modern, bearing tables, books\
      \ and studies as well as the previous wall carvings. There are also churches\
      \ and monasteries devoted to their Savior Princess from the Stars, who will\
      \ liberate them from the Sky Demons, otherwise known as the <a href=\"/Skaarj\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a>. The statues of the Savior appear more or less\
      \ androgynous, although there is a carving in the Sky Town monastery that depicts\
      \ the savior as a male figure similar in design to classical depictions of the\
      \ Christian God, bracketed by four-armed human angles. By contrast, a writing\
      \ in a basement of <a href=\"/Bluff_Eversmoking\" title=\"Bluff Eversmoking\"\
      >Bluff Eversmoking</a> specifically calls the savior a Princess. This could\
      \ be a representation of the beginning of different denominations or interpretations\
      \ forming in the Nali culture, a feature highly prominent in early Christianity.\
      \ It could also be, however, based on some dim early preception of the crash\
      \ of the <a href=\"/Vortex_Rikers\" title=\"Vortex Rikers\">UMS Vortex Rikers</a>,\
      \ and in it <a href=\"/Prisoner_849\" title=\"Prisoner 849\">Prisoner 849</a>\
      \ - The reference to the saviour as a female in Bluff Eversmoking could even\
      \ hint on Gina, the default player character in the game.\n</p><p>The polytheistic\
      \ temples are obviously older and in a greater state of disrepair, but they\
      \ are still maintained by Nali Priests, and it is obvious through Nali writings\
      \ that the old Gods are not yet fully discounted. This suggests a sort of transitional\
      \ phase from a typically more \"archaic\" polytheistic viewpoint to a more \"\
      modern\" monotheistic viewpoint.\n</p><p>As peaceful as the Nali are, there\
      \ are suggestions toward more brutal aspects of their culture. The <a href=\"\
      /Dark_Arena\" title=\"Dark Arena\">Dark Arena</a>, a Roman-style coloseum of\
      \ sorts, appears to be of Nali origin, and situated in view of the large portrait\
      \ of Vandora, who herself has a vengeful, hot-tempered look characteristic of\
      \ the attitudes of some Roman deities, is a sacrificial altar complete with\
      \ a blood groove. What exactly was sacrificed on this altar is unknown, but\
      \ it is easily large enough for a Nali to lie on. The Dark Arena and <a href=\"\
      /Nali_Castle\" title=\"Nali Castle\">Nali Castle</a> both contain dungeons and\
      \ torture chambers in their basements that appear to be of Nali construction,\
      \ though they are now under the operation of the Skaarj. This element suggests\
      \ that there may be more diverse elements of Nali culture than the presumption\
      \ of innocent, peaceful natives enslaved by evil invaders.\n</p><p>The Nali\
      \ will often build tests and trials, of varying lethality, and seem to value\
      \ sharp awareness of one's surroundings, an ability to interpret riddles, as\
      \ well as physical dexterity and daring.\n</p><p>The <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"\
      Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> have been a major element of Nali culture an ultimately\
      \ unknown period of time, but it is clear that they have been present for probably\
      \ several generations. As far back as Chizra the Skaarj are mentioned, with\
      \ their aquatic cousins, the <a href=\"/Slith\" title=\"Slith\">Slith</a> depicted\
      \ in carvings and mentioned in writings. There is, however, mention of a time\
      \ before the presence of the Skaarj, that temples must be purified by the Savior.\n\
      </p><p>The Nali religion is sophisticated and deep, making the Nali themselves\
      \ far more than the \"stereotyped natives\" typically attributed to them. Some\
      \ Nali documentation suggests that the Nali believed they had found a savior\
      \ in the <a href=\"/Prisoner_849\" title=\"Prisoner 849\">lone survivor</a>\
      \ of the <a href=\"/Vortex_Rikers\" title=\"Vortex Rikers\">Vortex Rikers</a>\
      \ crash, and that the end of the Sky Demons was at hand. However, the Nali are\
      \ still enslaved by the Skaarj, which calls into question whether Na Pali was\
      \ entirely liberated in the days following that incident. While it is unclear\
      \ whether the Nali had in fact driven the Skaarj from the planet at that time,\
      \ what can be confirmed is that the Vortex Rikers incident was a critical junction\
      \ in the buildup to the Human/Skaarj War, which in turn led to the <a href=\"\

      \ uncommon bonus feature, when a Nali ghost finds you friendly it will show\

      \n==Religion==\n[[Image:Nali Priest.jpg|thumb|200px|A Nali priest]]\nThere is\
      \ a sense of progression going on throughout the Nali's religious structures,\
      \ and the extent to which their belief system is true is difficult to ascertain.\
      \ The [[Chizra - Nali Water God|Temple of Chizra]], for example, is an extensive\
      \ temple devoted to the Nali Water God. Among other temples are the [[Temple\
      \ of Vandora]], the Goddess of Lightning; and the [[Velora Pass|Temple of Velora]].\
      \ It is not clear what Velora is the goddess of, though she is always associated\
      \ with trials and deadly traps. Velora and Chrizra seem to resemble Mayan or\
      \ Aztec gods from planet Earth, depicted in wall-carvings and relief statues.\
      \ They tend to be associated with large yellow bricks and wood as building materials,\
      \ and always have plenty of water in their temples.\n\nVandora's temple seems\
      \ more Gothic in design, and the depiction of Vandora herself appears closer,\
      \ perhaps, to Greek or Roman depictions of deities than Velora or Chizra. There\
      \ is a quote supposedly from Vandora herself written on the walls in one chamber\
      \ of her temple that reads: \"''And Vandora came down, with fire from the sky\
      \ upon her wings, and sanctified the holy fountain with her kiss. Thus, she\
      \ said, whoever follows me shall cast off the bonds of flesh and become as elusive\
      \ as the mist.''\" What is most striking about Vandora is that her basic structure\
      \ is human. She bears four arms, and a pair of feathered wings, but otherwise\
      \ she is human, suggesting that she was, perhaps, a survivor of a crash landing\
      \ farther back in Nali history who made a significant enough impression on the\
      \ Nali that they revered her as a Goddess. Further research into Nali mysticism\
      \ suggests a strong correlation with encounters with offworlders that defy anything\
      \ else existing in their culture. Nali often revere alien crafts that land or\
      \ crash on their planet, calling them chariots from the stars and the like.\
      \ A standard-issue [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Launcher]] is referred to by\
      \ the Nali as the \"Stick of Six Fires\".\n\nHowever, the Nali religion is not\
      \ entirely discounted as misinterpretation. In the Temple of Chizra, there was\
      \ discovered a documented account of Nali lore: \"''Look into your own eyes,\
      \ and when your courage is strongest your last step toward the prize will be\
      \ upheld by your faith.''\" Behind a hidden wall there is a pit with an obelisk\
      \ of sorts in the middle and a walkway surrounding it. Around the backside of\
      \ the obelisk is a mirror, in front of which floats a shield belt. There are\
      \ unconfirmed reports that it is in fact possible to walk unimpeded across the\
      \ pit and obtain that belt. Nali will occasionally speak of their dreams, or\
      \ make prophecies that end up coming true, in one way or another. Eventually,\
      \ it is never entirely sure how much truth there actually is to the Nali religion,\
      \ and how much is based on exposure to extraterrestrial elements.\n\nThe Nali\
      \ religion itself seems to be in the middle of a transformation. The Chizra\
      \ and Velora temples seem to be in the most disrepair, whereas the Vandora temple\
      \ seems slightly more modern, bearing tables, books and studies as well as the\
      \ previous wall carvings. There are also churches and monasteries devoted to\
      \ their Savior Princess from the Stars, who will liberate them from the Sky\
      \ Demons, otherwise known as the [[Skaarj]]. The statues of the Savior appear\
      \ more or less androgynous, although there is a carving in the Sky Town monastery\
      \ that depicts the savior as a male figure similar in design to classical depictions\
      \ of the Christian God, bracketed by four-armed human angles. By contrast, a\
      \ writing in a basement of [[Bluff Eversmoking]] specifically calls the savior\
      \ a Princess. This could be a representation of the beginning of different denominations\
      \ or interpretations forming in the Nali culture, a feature highly prominent\
      \ in early Christianity. It could also be, however, based on some dim early\
      \ preception of the crash of the [[Vortex Rikers|UMS Vortex Rikers]], and in\
      \ it [[Prisoner 849]] - The reference to the saviour as a female in Bluff Eversmoking\
      \ could even hint on Gina, the default player character in the game.\n\nThe\
      \ polytheistic temples are obviously older and in a greater state of disrepair,\
      \ but they are still maintained by Nali Priests, and it is obvious through Nali\
      \ writings that the old Gods are not yet fully discounted. This suggests a sort\
      \ of transitional phase from a typically more \"archaic\" polytheistic viewpoint\
      \ to a more \"modern\" monotheistic viewpoint.\n\nAs peaceful as the Nali are,\
      \ there are suggestions toward more brutal aspects of their culture. The [[Dark\
      \ Arena]], a Roman-style coloseum of sorts, appears to be of Nali origin, and\
      \ situated in view of the large portrait of Vandora, who herself has a vengeful,\
      \ hot-tempered look characteristic of the attitudes of some Roman deities, is\
      \ a sacrificial altar complete with a blood groove. What exactly was sacrificed\
      \ on this altar is unknown, but it is easily large enough for a Nali to lie\
      \ on. The Dark Arena and [[Nali Castle]] both contain dungeons and torture chambers\
      \ in their basements that appear to be of Nali construction, though they are\
      \ now under the operation of the Skaarj. This element suggests that there may\
      \ be more diverse elements of Nali culture than the presumption of innocent,\
      \ peaceful natives enslaved by evil invaders.\n\nThe Nali will often build tests\
      \ and trials, of varying lethality, and seem to value sharp awareness of one's\
      \ surroundings, an ability to interpret riddles, as well as physical dexterity\
      \ and daring.\n\nThe [[Skaarj]] have been a major element of Nali culture an\
      \ ultimately unknown period of time, but it is clear that they have been present\
      \ for probably several generations. As far back as Chizra the Skaarj are mentioned,\
      \ with their aquatic cousins, the [[Slith]] depicted in carvings and mentioned\
      \ in writings. There is, however, mention of a time before the presence of the\
      \ Skaarj, that temples must be purified by the Savior.\n\nThe Nali religion\
      \ is sophisticated and deep, making the Nali themselves far more than the \"\
      stereotyped natives\" typically attributed to them. Some Nali documentation\
      \ suggests that the Nali believed they had found a savior in the [[Prisoner\
      \ 849|lone survivor]] of the [[Vortex Rikers]] crash, and that the end of the\
      \ Sky Demons was at hand. However, the Nali are still enslaved by the Skaarj,\
      \ which calls into question whether Na Pali was entirely liberated in the days\
      \ following that incident. While it is unclear whether the Nali had in fact\
      \ driven the Skaarj from the planet at that time, what can be confirmed is that\
      \ the Vortex Rikers incident was a critical junction in the buildup to the Human/Skaarj\
      \ War, which in turn led to the [[Unreal Tournament|Tournament]].\n\n==Unreal\
      \ Championship 2==\nIn [[Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict|Unreal\
      \ Championship 2]] captured Nali are used in a [[:Category:Gametypes|gametype]]\
      \ called [[Nali Slaughter]], invented by the [[Skaarj]]. The Nali are dressed\
      \ in simple, white shorts and are forced to remain in areas filled with heavily\
      \ armed Tournament competitors who will try to kill as many of them as possible.\
      \ Besides regular Nali, which are worth one point, there are invisible Nali\
      \ who are worth three points, and explosive self-destructing Nali, who are worth\
      \ five. The self-destructing Nali can run faster, and will actually run towards\
      \ competitors trying to blow them up.\n\n==Trivia==\nA 2D pop-up Nali is one\
      \ of [[John Dalton]]'s targets in [[Unreal 2]]'s weapon training.\n\n[[Category:Sapient\
