      <p><br />\n<b>Lesser Brutes</b> are the Brutes encountered in the first levels\
      \ of <a href=\"/Unreal\" title=\"Unreal\">Unreal</a>. Lesser Brutes are the\
      \ first opponents Prisoner 849 encounters on Na Pali (as soon as she escapes\
      \ the Vortex Rikers prison ship). They can be recognized by their broad appearance,\
      \ their brown skin with yellow armor and the 2 large arm-mounted rocket launchers\
      \ it wields. \n</p><p>Of the 3 classes of Brutes, the Lesser Brute is the smallest\
      \ (only 1 head taller than the player), and it wears the least amount of armor,\
      \ wearing not much more than shoulder pads and ammo around its arms/chest. It\
      \ uses different (and less harmful) rocket launchers than the other brutes,\
      \ and it's not resistant to any kind of damage (due to its lack of armor). It\
      \ has one small advantage over the other Brutes though, as it is slightly quicker\
      \ than the other Brutes.\n</p><p>Because these opponents are found in the earlier\
      \ areas of Unreal, the player does not have a large arsenal of weapons to choose\
      \ from. The <a href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a>\
      \ is slightly more effective, but it is a good idea to use the <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\"\
      \ title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a>, as it does not use up ammunition\
      \ like the other weapons. It would take 11 shots with the Automag to take Lesser\
      \ Brute down, where the Dispersion Pistol's ammo will simply regenerate.\n</p><p>Lesser\
      \ Brutes re-appear in Unreal on several occasions, but as the player reaches\
      \ more important (and more heavily defended) areas, the task of guarding these\
      \ parts will be passed on to the other Brutes.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"\

      \ than with the Lesser Brutes. They wield different rocket launchers than the\
      \ Lesser Brutes (dealing more damage). They also move a bit slower and wear\
      \ more armor. Not only does this improve their health (Brutes have almost twice\
      \ as much health as Lesser Brutes), but it also makes them more resistant to\
      \ explosions. Weapons like <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\"\
      >Rocket Launcher</a> and <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak\
      \ Cannon</a> (usually the strongest weapons in the player's arsenal) now do\
      \ 30% less damage. It's still possible to take a Brute down using these weapons,\
      \ but it will cost more ammunition. As Brutes are slow moving, they are relatively\
      \ easy to hit with projectile weapons. It is wisest to keep one's distance from\
      \ them as much as possible and to look for (and duck behind) cover to avoid\
      \ getting hit by its many rockets.\n</p><p>In combat, Brutes (as well as Lesser\
      \ Brutes and Behemoths) will immediately fire rockets when they spot their target.\
      \ When the target is within range, the Brute will stand still to rapid-fire\
      \ its rockets, when it doesn't it will walk towards the target (possibly while\
      \ firing its rockets).  Brutes will also charge on occasions, but only when\
      \ they need to cover large distances.\n</p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\

      <p><br />\nThe <b>Behemoth</b> is the strongest and largest of the Brutes, and\
      \ can be recognized easily by its full set of blue armor. These Brutes are very\
      \ rare though: There are only 2 of them in Unreal, and they are fighting alongside\
      \ the Krall and Skaarj in Dasa Pass. Conflict between these species starts to\
      \ grow as the Behemoths keep on breaking the drawbridge (which the Skaarj then\
      \ have to repair) and \"live like slobs\". Prisoner 849 encounters, and puts\
      \ an end to, these Behemoths at the end of the <a href=\"/Cellars_at_Dasa_Pass\"\
      \ title=\"Cellars at Dasa Pass\">Cellars at Dasa Pass</a>, where she fights\
      \ both of them at once.\n</p><p>In <a href=\"/Return_to_Na_Pali\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Return to Na Pali\">Return to Na Pali</a> Behemoth appearances are\
      \ a lot less rare, Especially in the Skaarj Tarydium processing plant <a href=\"\
      /Foundry_Tarydium_Plant\" title=\"Foundry Tarydium Plant\">Foundry</a> and <a\
      \ href=\"/Bounds_of_Foundry\" title=\"Bounds of Foundry\">its bounds</a>, where\
      \ a total number of 8 Behemoths guard the different parts of the facility. There\
      \ are 2 more to be fought in the campaign, including one in the opening level.\n\
      </p><p>Defeating these Behemoths will prove to be challenging. Their health\
      \ is vastly superior to that of the other Brutes, and their size, though making\
      \ it easier to hit them, will make the fight even more difficult because it\
      \ will now often block entire passages with its body (which makes the first\
      \ encounter in Dasa Pass particularly more difficult). They also can lead enemies\
      \ with their rockets, causing them to become even more of a threat than Brutes.\n\

      \ explosive weapons, the Behemoth has 1.5x as much health as the Brute. Using\
      \ heavy fire from the <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\"\
      >Rocket Launcher</a> or <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak\
      \ Cannon</a> will take loads and loads of ammunition. It's crucial to use other\

      \ [[Dasa Mountain Pass]] Behemoths are found co-operating with the [[Krall]],\
      \ slaves of the Skaarj. Krall don't like Behemoths as it is hard to deal with\
      \ them. In [[Foundry Tarydium Plant|Foundry]], Brutes help Skaarj, but sometimes\
      \ tends to kill Skaarj instead of the player, usually when an accidental Skaarj\
      \ projectile hits the huge brute.\n\n==Lesser Brutes==\n{{Infobox Unreal Enemy\n\

      * [[Edge of Na Pali]]\n}}\n'''Lesser Brutes''' are the Brutes encountered in\
      \ the first levels of [[Unreal]]. Lesser Brutes are the first opponents Prisoner\
      \ 849 encounters on Na Pali (as soon as she escapes the Vortex Rikers prison\
      \ ship). They can be recognized by their broad appearance, their brown skin\
      \ with yellow armor and the 2 large arm-mounted rocket launchers it wields.\
      \ \n\nOf the 3 classes of Brutes, the Lesser Brute is the smallest (only 1 head\
      \ taller than the player), and it wears the least amount of armor, wearing not\
      \ much more than shoulder pads and ammo around its arms/chest. It uses different\
      \ (and less harmful) rocket launchers than the other brutes, and it's not resistant\
      \ to any kind of damage (due to its lack of armor). It has one small advantage\
      \ over the other Brutes though, as it is slightly quicker than the other Brutes.\n\
      \nBecause these opponents are found in the earlier areas of Unreal, the player\
      \ does not have a large arsenal of weapons to choose from. The [[Automag]] is\
      \ slightly more effective, but it is a good idea to use the [[Dispersion Pistol]],\
      \ as it does not use up ammunition like the other weapons. It would take 11\
      \ shots with the Automag to take Lesser Brute down, where the Dispersion Pistol's\
      \ ammo will simply regenerate.\n\nLesser Brutes re-appear in Unreal on several\
      \ occasions, but as the player reaches more important (and more heavily defended)\
      \ areas, the task of guarding these parts will be passed on to the other Brutes.\n\

      \ first appear in the [[Depths of Rrajigar]] and will be found guarding a lot\
      \ of the Skaarj's facilities throughout Unreal, including the [[Mothership Core]],\
      \ making them a crucial part of the Skaarj's defense.\nIn [[Return to Na Pali]]\
      \ Brutes appear less frequent, as most of their duties have been taken over\
      \ by Behemoths.\n\nBrutes are the \"middle class\", but have more in common\
      \ with the large Behemoths than with the Lesser Brutes. They wield different\
      \ rocket launchers than the Lesser Brutes (dealing more damage). They also move\
      \ a bit slower and wear more armor. Not only does this improve their health\
      \ (Brutes have almost twice as much health as Lesser Brutes), but it also makes\
      \ them more resistant to explosions. Weapons like [[Rocket Launcher]] and [[Flak\
      \ Cannon]] (usually the strongest weapons in the player's arsenal) now do 30%\
      \ less damage. It's still possible to take a Brute down using these weapons,\
      \ but it will cost more ammunition. As Brutes are slow moving, they are relatively\
      \ easy to hit with projectile weapons. It is wisest to keep one's distance from\
      \ them as much as possible and to look for (and duck behind) cover to avoid\
      \ getting hit by its many rockets.\n\nIn combat, Brutes (as well as Lesser Brutes\
      \ and Behemoths) will immediately fire rockets when they spot their target.\
      \ When the target is within range, the Brute will stand still to rapid-fire\
      \ its rockets, when it doesn't it will walk towards the target (possibly while\
      \ firing its rockets).  Brutes will also charge on occasions, but only when\
      \ they need to cover large distances.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\

      \ (dawn)]]\n* [[Foundry Tarydium Plant]]\n* [[Bounds of Foundry]]\n}}\nThe '''Behemoth'''\
      \ is the strongest and largest of the Brutes, and can be recognized easily by\
      \ its full set of blue armor. These Brutes are very rare though: There are only\
      \ 2 of them in Unreal, and they are fighting alongside the Krall and Skaarj\
      \ in Dasa Pass. Conflict between these species starts to grow as the Behemoths\
      \ keep on breaking the drawbridge (which the Skaarj then have to repair) and\
      \ \"live like slobs\". Prisoner 849 encounters, and puts an end to, these Behemoths\
      \ at the end of the [[Cellars at Dasa Pass]], where she fights both of them\
      \ at once.\n\nIn [[Return to Na Pali]] Behemoth appearances are a lot less rare,\
      \ Especially in the Skaarj Tarydium processing plant [[Foundry Tarydium Plant|Foundry]]\
      \ and [[Bounds of Foundry|its bounds]], where a total number of 8 Behemoths\
      \ guard the different parts of the facility. There are 2 more to be fought in\
      \ the campaign, including one in the opening level.\n\nDefeating these Behemoths\
      \ will prove to be challenging. Their health is vastly superior to that of the\
      \ other Brutes, and their size, though making it easier to hit them, will make\
      \ the fight even more difficult because it will now often block entire passages\
      \ with its body (which makes the first encounter in Dasa Pass particularly more\
      \ difficult). They also can lead enemies with their rockets, causing them to\
      \ become even more of a threat than Brutes.\n\nJust like the other Brutes, the\
      \ Behemoth will rapid-fire rockets while walking towards the target. And just\
      \ like the Brute, the Behemoth is resistant to explosions. However, where the\
      \ Brute could still be defeated using more explosive weapons, the Behemoth has\
      \ 1.5x as much health as the Brute. Using heavy fire from the [[Rocket Launcher]]\
      \ or [[Flak Cannon]] will take loads and loads of ammunition. It's crucial to\
      \ use other weapons (such as the [[Bio-Rifle]] or [[Shock Rifle#ASMD|ASMD]])\
      \ to prevent wasting large amounts of ammo.\n\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div>\n\
