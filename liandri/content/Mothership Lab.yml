      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Now within the depths of the Skaarj Mothership, an air of mystery descends\
      \ on this place as you enter the detention centre and laboratory area. Here,\
      \ strange experiments are being carried out on Skaarj test subjects as the Skaarj\
      \ seek to improve their combat abilities.\n</p><p>You start on the lift from\
      \ <a href=\"/Mothership_Basement\" title=\"Mothership Basement\">Mothership\
      \ Basement</a>, emerging in a room with consoles round the sides and an energy\
      \ conduit behind you. A <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper\" title=\"\
      Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjTrooper</a> with a <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"\
      Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a> in this room will ignore you at first\
      \ as he operates the consoles around the outside of the room. Kill the Skaarj\
      \ (he is behind and to the left of you as you start) and go into the corner\
      \ where he was operating the consoles.\n</p><p>There's a Health Pack in this\
      \ corner - collect it, then start reading the consoles. Watch out for another\
      \ SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol who comes in as you read [1, 2].\n\
      </p><p>There's another panel in the far corner [3].\n</p><p>Once you're filled\
      \ in on the Mothership power supply status, head off up to the corridor that\
      \ is to the left as you face this panel. After following the corridor round\
      \ a curve, you will come out in a room where a panel is guarded by a <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjWarrior</a>.\
      \ Kill the Skaarj then collect the Health Pack and the Rifle Rounds on one side\
      \ of this room. Read this panel [4].\n</p><p>Sounds like they're on to you.\
      \ Take the next corridor out of this area, such that you arrive in a large junction\
      \ room. Kill the SkaarjWarrior on guard there then look around. A door ahead\
      \ is locked and will not open. A door part way up the wall to the left is too\
      \ high to reach, though it looks as if you may be able to get up there later.\
      \ To the right, another high entrance is accessible by a lift.\n</p><p>Before\
      \ calling the lift, go to the left of the room and into the corner at this end\
      \ on that side of the room. Go round behind the diagonal support pillar in the\
      \ corner for two boxes of Razor Blades. Then, staying on this side of the room,\
      \ go behind the pillar at the far end for two cans of 12 Eightballs. Go to the\
      \ back right corner for a Health Pack, and behind the pillar there for a can\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge. The final pillar in the room reveals another Health Pack.\n\
      </p><p>Time to move on, so go to the button beneath the lift on the right side\
      \ of the room and press it. The lift descends diagonally, landing on the floor\
      \ of the room a short way out from the wall. Step on and ride it up to the corridor\
      \ above, entering and going round the corner.\n</p><p>Ahead, some Skaarj are\
      \ parolling to and fro, going across the main corridor through doors on either\
      \ side. Attack them as they come out; there's a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjGunner</a> with an <a href=\"/Enforcer\" title=\"\
      Enforcer\">Automag</a> and a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol. Kill them\
      \ both and collect the Automag dropped by the SkaarjGunner.\n</p><p>When both\
      \ have emerged and been killed, take the left of the two doors. You are in one\
      \ of the detention centre corridors; it's dark so you may want to use a <a href=\"\
      /Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flare</a>. Lighting the area up, you will see three\
      \ doors, one on either side and one at the end. Open the one on the right and\
      \ look through - behind a Force Field you will see a SkaarjWarrior and two <a\
      \ href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjAssassins</a>\
      \ who all ignore you. Now look through the door across the corridor; beyond,\
      \ the forcefield is the only thing shielding you from a huge and highly aggressive\
      \ blue Skaarj that tries to attack you. If that thing were to get out...\n</p><p>Finally,\
      \ look through the door and force field at the far end of the corridor. You\
      \ will see two SkaarjTroopers and one <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjOfficer</a>, all with Dispersion Pistols.\n\
      </p><p>Return down this detention centre corridor and cross the main corridor,\
      \ over to the other detention centre corridor. Look through the door and forcefield\
      \ on the left in this corridor; inside are two <a href=\"/Mercenary\" title=\"\
      Mercenary\">Mercenaries</a> and a MercenaryElite who come and gesticulate at\
      \ you before returning to their private discussion.\n</p><p>Look through the\
      \ door across the corridor. Another force field, behind which are several <a\
      \ href=\"/Bloblet\" title=\"Bloblet\">Bloblets</a> and two boxes of 10 Flak\
      \ Shells - but this particular forcefield can be shot open. So, use a weak weapon\
      \ to open the field, but be prepared to use a powerful weapon for the Bloblets,\
      \ like the <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball\
      \ Gun</a> for example. They will pursue you down the corridor a while, but when\
      \ they are dead, go into their cell and collect the Flak Shells. Then, return\
      \ to the corridor and open the door at the end.\n</p><p>Beyond the end door,\
      \ a <a href=\"/Pupae\" title=\"Pupae\">Pupae</a> hatchery room is guarded by\
      \ a SkaarjAssassin. Kill the Skaarj and go to the far end of the room for another\
      \ box of 10 Flak Shells - but beware the Pupae jumping out of the wall incubators.\
      \ Get quickly back to the detention centre corridor and from there to the main\
      \ corridor.\n</p><p>Once back in the main corridor, turn right to the foot of\
      \ a wider section which slopes upwards. Collect the Health Pack at the foot\
      \ of this area, then go up the slope and collect goodies from the area on the\
      \ right, in the form of an ASMD Core, another Flare and a Health Pack. There's\
      \ an entrance across the way from here; go through into a room (I'll call it\
      \ the Portal Junction Room) guarded by a SkaarjWarrior. Kill the Skaarj then\
      \ look around; there's a door ahead - it's locked with a message [5].\n</p><p>So,\
      \ you need to find a way of depleting the ship's power resources. Look at the\
      \ other exits from the room; two are portals that are currently inoperative,\
      \ while the third is a tunnel which curves round. Follow it into the room at\
      \ the end, killing the SkaarjWarrior within. I think that the <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\"\
      \ title=\"Shock Rifle\">ASMD</a> Combo is a fun and effective technique here.\n\
      </p><p>In this end room is a generous supply of gear; two Health Packs, a box\
      \ of 8 Rifle Rounds, a box of 50 Bullets and a <a href=\"/edit/Kevlar_Suit?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Kevlar Suit (page does not exist)\">Kevlar Suit</a>.\
      \ There's also a window out to a different part of the map but it is blocked\
      \ by a force field. This room also contains a button. Press it, then return\
      \ down the curving corridor to the Portal Junction Room; the previously blocked\
      \ portals are now operational.\n</p><p>Make a left and go through the portal\
      \ there. You may want to save your game before doing so, for as you emerge from\
      \ the portal at the other end, you come out on a narrow stretch of walkway above\
      \ an insta-death energy field. The walkway is guarded by a SkaarjTrooper with\
      \ an Eightball Gun. So, stay in the corridor entrance to the area and take it\
      \ out with head shots courtesy of the <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper\
      \ Rifle\">Rifle</a>. Retreat back down the portal whenever necessary. When it\
      \ has been decapitated, go out on to the walkway and collect the Eightball Gun\
      \ it drops.\n</p><p>As you emerge, you will probably spot or be spotted by another\
      \ SkaarjTrooper with an Eightball Gun who might shoot from a balcony on the\
      \ left or he might be wandering around ahead. Give it the same treatment as\
      \ the previous Skaarj the collect the Eightball Gun if you can from here. Go\
      \ along the walkway to the far end. At the far end is a foyer where two cans\
      \ of Tarydium Sludge sit on the end of the walkway ahead and a ramp goes up\
      \ to the right. Collect the sludge, still being careful not to fall off the\
      \ walkway, and go up the ramp to enter a corridor.\n</p><p>In the corridor,\
      \ follow its curvature round, collecting another box of 8 Rifle Rounds on the\
      \ way, coming out on another metal walkway guarded by a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjLord</a>. Kill the Skaarj.\n</p><p>Extra: Only\
      \ do this if you're feeling lucky or exceptionally skillful, and save your game\
      \ first. About half way along the stretch of walkway that was guarded by the\
      \ SkaarjLord, look down off the walkway to the right. You will see a <a href=\"\
      /Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super\
      \ Health Pack</a> on a small platform a long way below above the insta-death\
      \ field. This is the hardest part; drop so that you land on the platform and\
      \ collect the pack, but don't stick around here, instead run-jump off the platform\
      \ and on to the pipe on the left, without falling into the energy field, because\
      \ a few seconds after your weight lands on it, the Super Health Pack platform\
      \ collapses into the energy field.\n</p><p>From the pipe, you will see an alcove\
      \ in the wall containing a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>. Getting to that too is a tricky jump, so save\
      \ again. Once in the alcove, collect the Shield Belt and follow the alcove round,\
      \ and you can ride a lift that takes you up at the far end of the ramp the SkaarjLord\
      \ was guarding.\n</p><p>At the far end of the SkaarjLord's walkway, collect\
      \ the ASMD Core and two cans of 12 Eightballs there. Follow the corridor round,\
      \ crossing another walkway this time over green energy beams, and collect a\
      \ box of 50 Bullets from near a door at the far end. Go through the door to\
      \ collect a <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a>, then\
      \ go on round a bit further, eventually reaching a balcony with a view of the\
      \ walkway you initially came out of the portal on to.\n</p><p>On the balcony,\
      \ collect the <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault\
      \ Vest\">Assault Vest</a> ahead. There are Razor Blades on the left and a box\
      \ of 10 Flak Shells on the right. From the Flak Shells, the balcony turns into\
      \ a darkened passage. Use the Flashlight to go along the passage and catch a\
      \ lift on the left at the far end, coming out in a room at the top. Here, the\
      \ room stretches off to the left while an exit ahead leads out of the current\
      \ room. Go through that exit.\n</p><p>Out on the platform beyond is an Eightball\
      \ Gun and two cans of 12 Eightballs. You can also read signs to either side\
      \ of the doors you just came through to find out what the room at the top of\
      \ the list was [6, 7].\n</p><p>The platform turns into a metal grid walkway\
      \ which goes along this hall to a set of doors similar to those you just came\
      \ through, crossing another walkway half way along. Go on to the first stretch\
      \ of grid walkway and then look down through the floor: you will see the area\
      \ with the red energy field and walkways that you were in before beneath you.\
      \ You will also see pipes beneath the grid walkway on which there is an assortment\
      \ of gear.\n</p><p>Go to the right of the current walkway and jump up onto the\
      \ hand rail - it's awkward but possible. From there, drop down on to the top\
      \ pipe below and collect there a can of Tarydium Sludge and a box of 10 Flak\
      \ Shells. Go from there on to the next pipe down for a Health Pack, then from\
      \ there drop down again such that you land on the balcony where you picked up\
      \ the Assault Vest. Catch the same lift you took before back up to the Energy\
      \ Department Research Centre, then go back out through the doors on to the walkway\
      \ again.\n</p><p>On the walkways, go to the crossroads and look in either direction.\
      \ To the right, there's a portal - it's the other portal from the Portal Junction\
      \ Room, so there's no need to use it right now. To the left, there's a locked\
      \ door with a label [8].\n</p><p>Neither of these are the route to go yet then,\
      \ so go to the doors at the far end of the hall from where you entered, and\
      \ collect of the Razor Blades, two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and two Health\
      \ Packs. Read the signs by the door [9, 10].\n</p><p>Enter the Genetic Department\
      \ Research Centre, then activate and read the panel within [11].\n</p><p>Look\
      \ around the room.\n</p><p>This room contains nothing useful. The walls are\
      \ lined with cryopods. One thing of interest though before moving on; climb\
      \ the ramp to the left and doors open revealing a forcefield-shielded viewing\
      \ window over the Experimentation Facility, in which the only thing of interest\
      \ at present is an unarmed SkaarjOfficer on guard. There's a readout nearby\
      \ [12].\n</p><p>Physiological state of what you may ask? Oh well, done here,\
      \ so go to the far end from where you entered; go through a set of doors and\
      \ you will be in a plain room with another viewing area on the left. A door\
      \ on the right of this room reveals a security panel [13].\n</p><p>Leave the\
      \ panel and return to the main room, then carry on anticlockwise round this\
      \ ring of rooms. The next doors lead you back into the Energy Department Research\
      \ Centre; it's time to properly explore this room now. Read all the panels (they\
      \ make more sense if you start from the far end) [14-17].\n</p><p>This lab also\
      \ has a viewing balcony over the Experimentation Facility, but this balcony\
      \ this balcony also has a button and a readout. Climb the ramp (avoid the button\
      \ for now) and read the panel [18].\n</p><p>This could be the power drain you're\
      \ looking for! So, press the button. The force field over the Experimentation\
      \ Facility window disappears, and the ship shakes as an energy beam comes down\
      \ from the centre of the Experimentation Facility's roof. A hatch in the floor\
      \ opens as the experimental creature comes out; a large <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjBerserker</a> covered in a shimmering gold\
      \ shield effect. The Berserker lays into and kills the unfortunate unarmed SkaarjOfficer\
      \ on guard, then comes at you - kill it, either by shooting from the viewing\
      \ balcony or going in and fighting it at close range. Either way, kill it then\
      \ jump into the facility (if you've not gone in already).\n</p><p>When the Skaarj\
      \ is dead, collect the box of 10 Flak Shells available at the centre of the\
      \ room, then go out through the Experimentation Facility door, which is now\
      \ unlocked. You should have depleted the Power Reserves in activating the experiment,\
      \ thereby unlocking the door in the Portal Junction Room that was locked before.\
      \ If you wanted to confirm this, you could go back to the Genetic Department\
      \ Research Centre (you needn't bother) and read the viewing balcony readout\
      \ for a final message [19].\n</p><p>Anyway, cross the walkways and go through\
      \ the portal ahead. In the portal junction room, go right and right again, and\
      \ you will find that the previously locked door is unlocked. Go through and\
      \ a platform extends towards a lift which is at the top of a lift shaft with\
      \ funky green energy waves going down it. Take the lift down to the bottom of\
      \ the shaft (don't fall off), and look at your two exits. One is unlocked with\
      \ a platform extended towards it, whilst the other is locked, requiring a jump\
      \ to reach it, with a message [20].\n</p><p>So, take the other exit, going through\
      \ a corridor beyond and round into a dimly lit chamber. Enter, and lights come\
      \ on, illuminating two SkaarjTroopers. One, facing the other way at the far\
      \ end of the room, is of normal size and carries a <a href=\"/Minigun\" title=\"\
      Minigun\">Minigun</a>. The other, asleep at this end, is larger and carries\
      \ a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>. Kill them\
      \ both and collect the Flak Cannon and Minigun that they drop, then raid the\
      \ chamber for its other supplies; a Flare, two Flak Shells, three Rifle Rounds\
      \ and a Health Pack.\n</p><p>Go through the corridor at the far end of the chamber\
      \ and out through the door at the end; you will be back near the start of the\
      \ level, in the junction room where you first caught the lift up to the Detention\
      \ Area, but now an extra floor switch has appeared beneath the raised door opposite\
      \ the lift. Press it to create some stairs to the door, up which you can climb.\n\
      </p><p>At the top of the steps, go through the door. You will come out at the\
      \ top in an area where a button is guarded by a SkaarjLord; kill the Skaarj\
      \ then press the button, then go to the end of this passage to collect a Super\
      \ Health Pack from a balcony that overlooks the very first room.\nOnce the button\
      \ is pressed, the doors at the bottom of the lift shaft you came down have unlocked.\
      \ So, return to the bottom of the steps and go back through the door to the\
      \ left, going on until you reach the bottom of the lift shaft. The message over\
      \ the other door has gone and an access platform has been extended.\n</p><p>Time\
      \ to leave. So, cross the platform and go into the corridor beyond the doors\
      \ to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translator_Messages\"\

      \ walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\nNow within the depths of the\
      \ Skaarj Mothership, an air of mystery descends on this place as you enter the\
      \ detention centre and laboratory area. Here, strange experiments are being\
      \ carried out on Skaarj test subjects as the Skaarj seek to improve their combat\
      \ abilities.\n\nYou start on the lift from [[Mothership Basement]], emerging\
      \ in a room with consoles round the sides and an energy conduit behind you.\
      \ A [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper|SkaarjTrooper]] with a [[Dispersion Pistol]]\
      \ in this room will ignore you at first as he operates the consoles around the\
      \ outside of the room. Kill the Skaarj (he is behind and to the left of you\
      \ as you start) and go into the corner where he was operating the consoles.\n\
      \nThere's a Health Pack in this corner - collect it, then start reading the\
      \ consoles. Watch out for another SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol who\
      \ comes in as you read [1, 2].\n\nThere's another panel in the far corner [3].\n\
      \nOnce you're filled in on the Mothership power supply status, head off up to\
      \ the corridor that is to the left as you face this panel. After following the\
      \ corridor round a curve, you will come out in a room where a panel is guarded\
      \ by a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]]. Kill the Skaarj then\
      \ collect the Health Pack and the Rifle Rounds on one side of this room. Read\
      \ this panel [4].\n\nSounds like they're on to you. Take the next corridor out\
      \ of this area, such that you arrive in a large junction room. Kill the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ on guard there then look around. A door ahead is locked and will not open.\
      \ A door part way up the wall to the left is too high to reach, though it looks\
      \ as if you may be able to get up there later. To the right, another high entrance\
      \ is accessible by a lift.\n\nBefore calling the lift, go to the left of the\
      \ room and into the corner at this end on that side of the room. Go round behind\
      \ the diagonal support pillar in the corner for two boxes of Razor Blades. Then,\
      \ staying on this side of the room, go behind the pillar at the far end for\
      \ two cans of 12 Eightballs. Go to the back right corner for a Health Pack,\
      \ and behind the pillar there for a can of Tarydium Sludge. The final pillar\
      \ in the room reveals another Health Pack.\n\nTime to move on, so go to the\
      \ button beneath the lift on the right side of the room and press it. The lift\
      \ descends diagonally, landing on the floor of the room a short way out from\
      \ the wall. Step on and ride it up to the corridor above, entering and going\
      \ round the corner.\n\nAhead, some Skaarj are parolling to and fro, going across\
      \ the main corridor through doors on either side. Attack them as they come out;\
      \ there's a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner|SkaarjGunner]] with an [[Enforcer|Automag]]\
      \ and a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol. Kill them both and collect the\
      \ Automag dropped by the SkaarjGunner.\n\nWhen both have emerged and been killed,\
      \ take the left of the two doors. You are in one of the detention centre corridors;\
      \ it's dark so you may want to use a [[Flare]]. Lighting the area up, you will\
      \ see three doors, one on either side and one at the end. Open the one on the\
      \ right and look through - behind a Force Field you will see a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ and two [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin|SkaarjAssassins]] who all ignore\
      \ you. Now look through the door across the corridor; beyond, the forcefield\
      \ is the only thing shielding you from a huge and highly aggressive blue Skaarj\
      \ that tries to attack you. If that thing were to get out...\n\nFinally, look\
      \ through the door and force field at the far end of the corridor. You will\
      \ see two SkaarjTroopers and one [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer|SkaarjOfficer]],\
      \ all with Dispersion Pistols.\n\nReturn down this detention centre corridor\
      \ and cross the main corridor, over to the other detention centre corridor.\
      \ Look through the door and forcefield on the left in this corridor; inside\
      \ are two [[Mercenary|Mercenaries]] and a MercenaryElite who come and gesticulate\
      \ at you before returning to their private discussion.\n\nLook through the door\
      \ across the corridor. Another force field, behind which are several [[Bloblet|Bloblets]]\
      \ and two boxes of 10 Flak Shells - but this particular forcefield can be shot\
      \ open. So, use a weak weapon to open the field, but be prepared to use a powerful\
      \ weapon for the Bloblets, like the [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball Gun]] for example.\
      \ They will pursue you down the corridor a while, but when they are dead, go\
      \ into their cell and collect the Flak Shells. Then, return to the corridor\
      \ and open the door at the end.\n\nBeyond the end door, a [[Pupae]] hatchery\
      \ room is guarded by a SkaarjAssassin. Kill the Skaarj and go to the far end\
      \ of the room for another box of 10 Flak Shells - but beware the Pupae jumping\
      \ out of the wall incubators. Get quickly back to the detention centre corridor\
      \ and from there to the main corridor.\n\nOnce back in the main corridor, turn\
      \ right to the foot of a wider section which slopes upwards. Collect the Health\
      \ Pack at the foot of this area, then go up the slope and collect goodies from\
      \ the area on the right, in the form of an ASMD Core, another Flare and a Health\
      \ Pack. There's an entrance across the way from here; go through into a room\
      \ (I'll call it the Portal Junction Room) guarded by a SkaarjWarrior. Kill the\
      \ Skaarj then look around; there's a door ahead - it's locked with a message\
      \ [5].\n\nSo, you need to find a way of depleting the ship's power resources.\
      \ Look at the other exits from the room; two are portals that are currently\
      \ inoperative, while the third is a tunnel which curves round. Follow it into\
      \ the room at the end, killing the SkaarjWarrior within. I think that the [[Shock\
      \ Rifle|ASMD]] Combo is a fun and effective technique here.\n\nIn this end room\
      \ is a generous supply of gear; two Health Packs, a box of 8 Rifle Rounds, a\
      \ box of 50 Bullets and a [[Kevlar Suit]]. There's also a window out to a different\
      \ part of the map but it is blocked by a force field. This room also contains\
      \ a button. Press it, then return down the curving corridor to the Portal Junction\
      \ Room; the previously blocked portals are now operational.\n\nMake a left and\
      \ go through the portal there. You may want to save your game before doing so,\
      \ for as you emerge from the portal at the other end, you come out on a narrow\
      \ stretch of walkway above an insta-death energy field. The walkway is guarded\
      \ by a SkaarjTrooper with an Eightball Gun. So, stay in the corridor entrance\
      \ to the area and take it out with head shots courtesy of the [[Sniper Rifle|Rifle]].\
      \ Retreat back down the portal whenever necessary. When it has been decapitated,\
      \ go out on to the walkway and collect the Eightball Gun it drops.\n\nAs you\
      \ emerge, you will probably spot or be spotted by another SkaarjTrooper with\
      \ an Eightball Gun who might shoot from a balcony on the left or he might be\
      \ wandering around ahead. Give it the same treatment as the previous Skaarj\
      \ the collect the Eightball Gun if you can from here. Go along the walkway to\
      \ the far end. At the far end is a foyer where two cans of Tarydium Sludge sit\
      \ on the end of the walkway ahead and a ramp goes up to the right. Collect the\
      \ sludge, still being careful not to fall off the walkway, and go up the ramp\
      \ to enter a corridor.\n\nIn the corridor, follow its curvature round, collecting\
      \ another box of 8 Rifle Rounds on the way, coming out on another metal walkway\
      \ guarded by a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord|SkaarjLord]]. Kill the Skaarj.\n\
      \nExtra: Only do this if you're feeling lucky or exceptionally skillful, and\
      \ save your game first. About half way along the stretch of walkway that was\
      \ guarded by the SkaarjLord, look down off the walkway to the right. You will\
      \ see a [[Super Health Pack]] on a small platform a long way below above the\
      \ insta-death field. This is the hardest part; drop so that you land on the\
      \ platform and collect the pack, but don't stick around here, instead run-jump\
      \ off the platform and on to the pipe on the left, without falling into the\
      \ energy field, because a few seconds after your weight lands on it, the Super\
      \ Health Pack platform collapses into the energy field.\n\nFrom the pipe, you\
      \ will see an alcove in the wall containing a [[Shield Belt]]. Getting to that\
      \ too is a tricky jump, so save again. Once in the alcove, collect the Shield\
      \ Belt and follow the alcove round, and you can ride a lift that takes you up\
      \ at the far end of the ramp the SkaarjLord was guarding.\n\nAt the far end\
      \ of the SkaarjLord's walkway, collect the ASMD Core and two cans of 12 Eightballs\
      \ there. Follow the corridor round, crossing another walkway this time over\
      \ green energy beams, and collect a box of 50 Bullets from near a door at the\
      \ far end. Go through the door to collect a [[Flashlight]], then go on round\
      \ a bit further, eventually reaching a balcony with a view of the walkway you\
      \ initially came out of the portal on to.\n\nOn the balcony, collect the [[Assault\
      \ Vest]] ahead. There are Razor Blades on the left and a box of 10 Flak Shells\
      \ on the right. From the Flak Shells, the balcony turns into a darkened passage.\
      \ Use the Flashlight to go along the passage and catch a lift on the left at\
      \ the far end, coming out in a room at the top. Here, the room stretches off\
      \ to the left while an exit ahead leads out of the current room. Go through\
      \ that exit.\n\nOut on the platform beyond is an Eightball Gun and two cans\
      \ of 12 Eightballs. You can also read signs to either side of the doors you\
      \ just came through to find out what the room at the top of the list was [6,\
      \ 7].\n\nThe platform turns into a metal grid walkway which goes along this\
      \ hall to a set of doors similar to those you just came through, crossing another\
      \ walkway half way along. Go on to the first stretch of grid walkway and then\
      \ look down through the floor: you will see the area with the red energy field\
      \ and walkways that you were in before beneath you. You will also see pipes\
      \ beneath the grid walkway on which there is an assortment of gear.\n\nGo to\
      \ the right of the current walkway and jump up onto the hand rail - it's awkward\
      \ but possible. From there, drop down on to the top pipe below and collect there\
      \ a can of Tarydium Sludge and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Go from there on to\
      \ the next pipe down for a Health Pack, then from there drop down again such\
      \ that you land on the balcony where you picked up the Assault Vest. Catch the\
      \ same lift you took before back up to the Energy Department Research Centre,\
      \ then go back out through the doors on to the walkway again.\n\nOn the walkways,\
      \ go to the crossroads and look in either direction. To the right, there's a\
      \ portal - it's the other portal from the Portal Junction Room, so there's no\
      \ need to use it right now. To the left, there's a locked door with a label\
      \ [8].\n\nNeither of these are the route to go yet then, so go to the doors\
      \ at the far end of the hall from where you entered, and collect of the Razor\
      \ Blades, two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards and two Health Packs. Read the\
      \ signs by the door [9, 10].\n\nEnter the Genetic Department Research Centre,\
      \ then activate and read the panel within [11].\n\nLook around the room.\n\n\
      This room contains nothing useful. The walls are lined with cryopods. One thing\
      \ of interest though before moving on; climb the ramp to the left and doors\
      \ open revealing a forcefield-shielded viewing window over the Experimentation\
      \ Facility, in which the only thing of interest at present is an unarmed SkaarjOfficer\
      \ on guard. There's a readout nearby [12].\n\nPhysiological state of what you\
      \ may ask? Oh well, done here, so go to the far end from where you entered;\
      \ go through a set of doors and you will be in a plain room with another viewing\
      \ area on the left. A door on the right of this room reveals a security panel\
      \ [13].\n\nLeave the panel and return to the main room, then carry on anticlockwise\
      \ round this ring of rooms. The next doors lead you back into the Energy Department\
      \ Research Centre; it's time to properly explore this room now. Read all the\
      \ panels (they make more sense if you start from the far end) [14-17].\n\nThis\
      \ lab also has a viewing balcony over the Experimentation Facility, but this\
      \ balcony this balcony also has a button and a readout. Climb the ramp (avoid\
      \ the button for now) and read the panel [18].\n\nThis could be the power drain\
      \ you're looking for! So, press the button. The force field over the Experimentation\
      \ Facility window disappears, and the ship shakes as an energy beam comes down\
      \ from the centre of the Experimentation Facility's roof. A hatch in the floor\
      \ opens as the experimental creature comes out; a large [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker|SkaarjBerserker]]\
      \ covered in a shimmering gold shield effect. The Berserker lays into and kills\
      \ the unfortunate unarmed SkaarjOfficer on guard, then comes at you - kill it,\
      \ either by shooting from the viewing balcony or going in and fighting it at\
      \ close range. Either way, kill it then jump into the facility (if you've not\
      \ gone in already).\n\nWhen the Skaarj is dead, collect the box of 10 Flak Shells\
      \ available at the centre of the room, then go out through the Experimentation\
      \ Facility door, which is now unlocked. You should have depleted the Power Reserves\
      \ in activating the experiment, thereby unlocking the door in the Portal Junction\
      \ Room that was locked before. If you wanted to confirm this, you could go back\
      \ to the Genetic Department Research Centre (you needn't bother) and read the\
      \ viewing balcony readout for a final message [19].\n\nAnyway, cross the walkways\
      \ and go through the portal ahead. In the portal junction room, go right and\
      \ right again, and you will find that the previously locked door is unlocked.\
      \ Go through and a platform extends towards a lift which is at the top of a\
      \ lift shaft with funky green energy waves going down it. Take the lift down\
      \ to the bottom of the shaft (don't fall off), and look at your two exits. One\
      \ is unlocked with a platform extended towards it, whilst the other is locked,\
      \ requiring a jump to reach it, with a message [20].\n\nSo, take the other exit,\
      \ going through a corridor beyond and round into a dimly lit chamber. Enter,\
      \ and lights come on, illuminating two SkaarjTroopers. One, facing the other\
      \ way at the far end of the room, is of normal size and carries a [[Minigun]].\
      \ The other, asleep at this end, is larger and carries a [[Flak Cannon]]. Kill\
      \ them both and collect the Flak Cannon and Minigun that they drop, then raid\
      \ the chamber for its other supplies; a Flare, two Flak Shells, three Rifle\
      \ Rounds and a Health Pack.\n\nGo through the corridor at the far end of the\
      \ chamber and out through the door at the end; you will be back near the start\
      \ of the level, in the junction room where you first caught the lift up to the\
      \ Detention Area, but now an extra floor switch has appeared beneath the raised\
      \ door opposite the lift. Press it to create some stairs to the door, up which\
      \ you can climb.\n\nAt the top of the steps, go through the door. You will come\
      \ out at the top in an area where a button is guarded by a SkaarjLord; kill\
      \ the Skaarj then press the button, then go to the end of this passage to collect\
      \ a Super Health Pack from a balcony that overlooks the very first room.\nOnce\
      \ the button is pressed, the doors at the bottom of the lift shaft you came\
      \ down have unlocked. So, return to the bottom of the steps and go back through\
      \ the door to the left, going on until you reach the bottom of the lift shaft.\
      \ The message over the other door has gone and an access platform has been extended.\n\
      \nTime to leave. So, cross the platform and go into the corridor beyond the\
      \ doors to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"Primary Power Supply\
