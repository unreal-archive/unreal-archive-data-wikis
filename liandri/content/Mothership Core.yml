      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Deeper still into the Mothership... you are now in the core of the great\
      \ vessel, and there's no turning back. But the Skaarj are getting worse - there's\
      \ no doubt about that. Time to ready your most powerful weapons and take the\
      \ proverbial plunge...\n</p><p>You start in the corridor by which you left the\
      \ <a href=\"/Mothership_Lab\" title=\"Mothership Lab\">Mothership Lab</a>. The\
      \ passage you are in goes up steps to the right, so follow them round, arriving\
      \ at a lift shaft. A lift comes down, with an unarmed <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjTrooper</a> aboard.\n</p><p>The Skaarj is weak\
      \ and easily disposed of with a single Flak Shell, so kill it then let the lift\
      \ go back up. Go on to the floor beneath where the lift was to grab a <a href=\"\
      /Shield_Belt\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>.\
      \ Go back on to the steps, and the lift comes back - get aboard and ride it\
      \ to the top, then step off into a low corridor.\n</p><p>This corridor is part\
      \ of what I'll call the Loop. It's a ring of corridors and rooms that goes around\
      \ a central core room, and you're going to go round it several times as this\
      \ level progresses.\nTake a right in the Loop corridor here, and go through\
      \ doors at the end into a dark-ish room where you will be attacked by a <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjLord</a> - kill\
      \ the Skaarj then enter the room it was guarding. This room is empty except\
      \ for a Health Pack at the back left, but there's an exit in the front left\
      \ corner, so go through it and go down the slope of the corridor beyond. You\
      \ will find that your corridor makes a right through a hatch that opens as you\
      \ approach it, near an alcove containing various goodies where a <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjBerserker</a>\
      \ operates a control panel. Unfortunately, the alcove is blocked by a forcefield,\
      \ and I can tell you now that you won't be getting in there in this level.\n\
      So, instead, follow the corridor to the right through the hatch that opened.\
      \ It takes you out on a balcony overlooking the central core room, where you\
      \ will have an altercation with a SkaarjTrooper with an <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\"\
      \ title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a>. Kill him and collect the Eightball\
      \ Gun that he drops. If he jumps off the balcony into the core room itself then\
      \ don't worry, you can deal with him later.\n</p><p>Go to the end of this balcony\
      \ and collect the Health Pack at the far end. A walkway turns off to the left\
      \ here, continuing to follow the outside of the core room. After a bit of winding,\
      \ it takes you out in a corridor where you will probably meet a SkaarjTrooper\
      \ with a <a href=\"/Ripper\" title=\"Ripper\">Razorjack</a>. Kill him then collect\
      \ the Razorjack that he drops.\n</p><p>Note: Throughout this part of the walkthrough\
      \ you will find that Skaarj like to move about and run off when they see you,\
      \ bringing others back or leaving you confused. I cannot cover it all so you'll\
      \ have to take some initiative on this one; be prepared for a surprise, then\
      \ do what you think best.\n</p><p>Look to the right from the walkway you entered\
      \ this corridor by. There's a locked door there, with a brightly glowing readout\
      \ over it [1].\n</p><p>Exercise caution in the next stretch because there's\
      \ another SkaarjTrooper with a Razorjack on patrol here somewhere. When you\
      \ meet him, you should kill him and take his Razorjack. Anyway, from the locked\
      \ door continue your anticlockwise journey round the Loop by going the other\
      \ way up the corridor and following its curve. Shortly you will meet a SkaarjTrooper\
      \ / <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjGunner</a>\
      \ hybrid carrying a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>,\
      \ and maybe a <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\"\
      >SkaarjWarrior</a>. Kill both Skaarj then collect the Flak Cannon the SkaarjTrooper\
      \ / SkaarjGunner hybrid drops, then enter the area the Skaarj were guarding.\
      \ This is a brief detour from your journey round the Loop, but bear with me.\n\
      </p><p>This area is a set of ramps that go down in two stages and then under\
      \ the Loop to come out in the core room. There's little of interest in the core\
      \ room itself, but explore this ramp area for goodies.\n</p><p>Take the ramp\
      \ on the left and you will find a Health Pack at the top. Continue down, and\
      \ when you can, climb a diagonal support on to a raised platform where you can\
      \ pick up an <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Assault\
      \ Vest\">Assault Vest</a> and another Health Pack. Drop down from there on to\
      \ the flat half-way stage where the ramp system doubles back on itself. If you\
      \ go through a small wall-opening there you will find a box of Razor Blades\
      \ and an alcove containing assorted gear, but the alcove is blocked off by a\
      \ nasty electric field.\n</p><p>Go back out and down the lower ramp a little,\
      \ turning back and climbing back up the diagonal support strut to the right\
      \ when you get the opportunity. Hop over the hand rail and go into an alcove\
      \ beneath the upper ramp on this side for a Health Pack, a Flare, an ASMD Core\
      \ and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Then, go back out and across the ramp, clinbing\
      \ over into another similar alcove beneath the ramp opposite for another Health\
      \ Pack, a Flak Shell and a box of 8 Rifle Rounds. When you're done, return to\
      \ the ramp.\n</p><p>Climb back up the ramps and re-join the Loop. Follow the\
      \ Loop corridor to the right, resuming your anticlockwise journey. After the\
      \ corridor has curved round a while, you can duck behind a panel for a box of\
      \ Razor Blades. Follow the corridor as it turns into another raised walkway\
      \ over the core room, then go round it unto another corridor away from the core\
      \ with doors at the far end, where alcoves along the side contain a can of 12\
      \ Eightballs, 40 Tarydium Shards and a box of 50 Bullets. Go along and through\
      \ the doors at the far end to enter yet another room filled with large techno\
      \ structures.\n</p><p>This room is guarded by a SkaarjTrooper with a <a href=\"\
      /Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a> and a\
      \ <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjOfficer</a>\
      \ with a <a href=\"/Bio_Rifle\" title=\"Bio Rifle\">GES Biorifle</a>. Kill the\
      \ two then collect the GES Biorifle dropped by the SkaarjOfficer. Go round the\
      \ edge of this room to collect two cans of Tarydium Sludge and a box of 50 Bullets.\
      \ Go through the doors out of this room that were to the left as you entered.\
      \ One corner and one Health Pack later, and you are back at the top of the small\
      \ lift you used right at the start of the level. You've completed a circuit\
      \ of the Loop.\n</p><p>You're going to have to do some freelancing now. Remember\
      \ that locked door with the glowing message over it? Well, you have to go through\
      \ there. But it'll only open when you have killed all the Skaarj that this part\
      \ of the level throws at you. You have to complete several circuits of the Loop;\
      \ you will find consistent numbers of reinforcements in the form of <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">SkaarjInfantry</a>\
      \ with <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stingers</a> and the occasional\
      \ <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\">SkaarjAssassin</a>\
      \ or SkaarjLord. Kill them all, none must escape. Collect any Stingers dropped\
      \ by the SkaarjInfantry.\n</p><p>With each circuit of the loop that you complete,\
      \ check the locked door. When you have killed enough Skaarj (if you are going\
      \ round the loop and meeting no Skaarj but the door still hasn't changed then\
      \ check the core room for any skulkers), you will see that the readout has vanished\
      \ and the door is in darkness. Shortly after that, it bursts open, revealing\
      \ a SkaarjOfficer with a Stinger and a SkaarjGunner with a Razorjack. Kill them.\n\
      </p><p>When they are both dead and you have collected the Stinger and Razorjack\
      \ that they drop, go through the now open doors yourself and down the sloping\
      \ corridor beyond. At the bottom, you will reach a walkway over some fields\
      \ where you will fight and kill a SkaarjWarrior.\n</p><p>Go along the walkway,\
      \ collecting a Health Pack along the way. Then, a curving corridor at the far\
      \ end will lead you via another Health Pack to another of those energy lifts.\
      \ Step on it and ride to the top. Step out at the top, and you are in a kind\
      \ of science area where you can go several ways; a SkaarjLord dozes on the right,\
      \ so kill him. Go to the right and into a small passage there for a Health Pack\
      \ and 40 Tarydium Shards, but come straight back one you've collected the gear.\n\
      Returning from the small passage, drop off to the left into a recessed area\
      \ where there are cryopods by the walls. Collect of the Health Pack, box of\
      \ 50 Bullets and box of 10 Flak Shells there then activate and read the panel\
      \ nearby [2].\n</p><p>When you're done here, go and press the button on the\
      \ other side of the recess to call a lift to take you back up to the main hallway\
      \ above. Ride that lift and turn left, going back past the top of the energy\
      \ lift shaft and going along to the door at the far end, which is blocked with\
      \ a large readout over it [3].\n</p><p>Follow this area on round, forking to\
      \ the left as you return from the locked door. A forcefield on the left (by\
      \ which there is a can of 12 Eightballs) blocks the way back to an area you\
      \ will recognise from MotherShip Lab. Continue along and in the room beyond\
      \ watch out for a SkaarjInfantry with a Stinger, then go into the room's corners\
      \ for 40 Tarydium Shards, a Health Pack and an ASMD Core. You can see a <a href=\"\
      /Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super\
      \ Health Pack</a> in a raised passage but you can't reach it from here yet.\n\
      A narrow passage (containing a Health Pack) from the far corner of this area\
      \ leads round to a raised crossroads of walkways above a part of the Loop. Looking\
      \ over to the right from this position you will see the other mouth of the raised\
      \ passage containing the Super Health Pack - but you still can't get it.\n</p><p>Return\
      \ to this crossroads from the passage by the same access route, then look at\
      \ the other exits. The rightermost one leads back to the cryopods, so go instead\
      \ to the one directly ahead. It is locked with a readout [4].\n</p><p>Look at\
      \ the other exit. It too is locked with a message [5].\n</p><p>You're not completely\
      \ stumped though, as 45° anticlockwise from here a forcefield bridge leads away\
      \ from the crossroads.\n</p><p>Cross the bridge into the area beyond. Alcoves\
      \ on either side reveal a Health Pack and a box of Razor Blades. Collect, then\
      \ activate and read the panel at the back [6].\n</p><p>Shoot the rear panel\
      \ of the alcove where the Health Pack was. It will lift up to reveal <a href=\"\
      /Jump_Boots\" title=\"Jump Boots\">Jump Boots</a>. Collect them, then return\
      \ across the force field bridge to the crossroads. You can now get the Super\
      \ Health Pack - but approach the Super Health Pack passage from the other end\
      \ - you won't be able to jump to it from here.\n</p><p>Return the crossroads\
      \ and go to the entrance on the other side to the left, which is now open. Go\
      \ through into the passage and approach a tempting Super Health Pack, but a\
      \ door slams shut over it whilst another opens to the right to reveal an angry\
      \ SkaarjWarrior. Kill it, then enter the room from which it emerged. This room\
      \ contains a lift to a raised walkway, but first visit alcoves in the room for\
      \ two Flak Shells, a box of 8 Rifle Rounds and two cans of Tarydium Sludge.\n\
      </p><p>Take the lift and make a left as you step off at the top on to the raised\
      \ walkway, entering another small passage which curves round, leading to a Health\
      \ Pack and a button. Press the button. What it does is to re-open the hatch\
      \ over the Super Health Pack - but before going back down, go on to the raised\
      \ walkway and enter the passage at the other end. After a short curve with a\
      \ Health Pack, you will be in a room where purple laser beams oscillate across\
      \ your view.\n</p><p>This bit's not too tough, but save your game anyway. Then,\
      \ go into the room and negotiate the lasers - try not to get squished (I use\
      \ the alcoves at the side and do it step by step). Your reward at the far end\
      \ is a Health Pack, a Shield Belt and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Return through\
      \ the beams, and drop to floor level beneath the raised walkway.\n</p><p>With\
      \ Invisibility on, this is just a run through.\n</p><p>Go out into the passage\
      \ and turn right, collecting the Super Health Pack. You are on a high ledge\
      \ above the core room from earlier. As you approach, a platform extends across\
      \ the gap to a ledge on the other side - go across and enter the small dark\
      \ passage on the left, but beware the SkaarjWarrior who attacks from the darkness.\n\
      </p><p>Use a light source to negotiate the corridor and follow its curve on\
      \ round. You will arrive in the Security Post - a room full of panels guarded\
      \ by a SkaarjAssassin in plain view and a SkaarjInfantry with a Stinger round\
      \ the corner. kill both Skaarj and collect the SkaarjInfantry's Stinger. In\
      \ doing so you will see a button in the area in which the SkaarjInfantry was\
      \ lurking, but don't press it yet - read the three panels in this area first\
      \ [7-9].\n</p><p>Now it is time to press the button. So, do so. An alert siren\
      \ goes off and the panels change [10-12].\n</p><p>Small passages at either end\
      \ of the security post (you came in by one) lead you back out to the high ledges\
      \ above the core room. Take your pick. Then, go back out to the raised crossroads\
      \ and go round to the now open Primary Power Supply entrance (next one anticlockwise).\
      \ Look in through the entrance and kill the <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"Brute\"\
      >Brute</a> on guard in the large corridor beyond.\n</p><p>Enter the corridor\
      \ and go along. The corridor is lined with gear as you proceed; a box of 8 Rifle\
      \ Rounds, two boxes of 10 Flak Shells, two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, a\
      \ Flare, two boxes of Razor Blades, two cans of 12 Eightballs, two cans of Tarydium\
      \ Sludge, two ASMD Cores and a Health Pack. Beyond this gear, the corridor curves\
      \ round and goes on inwards.\n</p><p>Follow the corridor on through the Mothership.\
      \ Soon you will reach a junction with a cache of gear behind a forcefield on\
      \ the left, where a SkaarjWarrior attacks from a continuation of the corridor\
      \ to the right. Kill the Skaarj - you're not going to get that forcefield open\
      \ in a hurry, so go the other way. After a curve, you will reach a pair of doors.\
      \ Go through them to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ\
      \ on other difficulty settings.''\n\nDeeper still into the Mothership... you\
      \ are now in the core of the great vessel, and there's no turning back. But\
      \ the Skaarj are getting worse - there's no doubt about that. Time to ready\
      \ your most powerful weapons and take the proverbial plunge...\n\nYou start\
      \ in the corridor by which you left the [[Mothership Lab]]. The passage you\
      \ are in goes up steps to the right, so follow them round, arriving at a lift\
      \ shaft. A lift comes down, with an unarmed [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Trooper|SkaarjTrooper]]\
      \ aboard.\n\nThe Skaarj is weak and easily disposed of with a single Flak Shell,\
      \ so kill it then let the lift go back up. Go on to the floor beneath where\
      \ the lift was to grab a [[Shield Belt]]. Go back on to the steps, and the lift\
      \ comes back - get aboard and ride it to the top, then step off into a low corridor.\n\
      \nThis corridor is part of what I'll call the Loop. It's a ring of corridors\
      \ and rooms that goes around a central core room, and you're going to go round\
      \ it several times as this level progresses.\nTake a right in the Loop corridor\
      \ here, and go through doors at the end into a dark-ish room where you will\
      \ be attacked by a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Lord|SkaarjLord]] - kill the Skaarj\
      \ then enter the room it was guarding. This room is empty except for a Health\
      \ Pack at the back left, but there's an exit in the front left corner, so go\
      \ through it and go down the slope of the corridor beyond. You will find that\
      \ your corridor makes a right through a hatch that opens as you approach it,\
      \ near an alcove containing various goodies where a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Berserker|SkaarjBerserker]]\
      \ operates a control panel. Unfortunately, the alcove is blocked by a forcefield,\
      \ and I can tell you now that you won't be getting in there in this level.\n\
      So, instead, follow the corridor to the right through the hatch that opened.\
      \ It takes you out on a balcony overlooking the central core room, where you\
      \ will have an altercation with a SkaarjTrooper with an [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball\
      \ Gun]]. Kill him and collect the Eightball Gun that he drops. If he jumps off\
      \ the balcony into the core room itself then don't worry, you can deal with\
      \ him later.\n\nGo to the end of this balcony and collect the Health Pack at\
      \ the far end. A walkway turns off to the left here, continuing to follow the\
      \ outside of the core room. After a bit of winding, it takes you out in a corridor\
      \ where you will probably meet a SkaarjTrooper with a [[Ripper|Razorjack]].\
      \ Kill him then collect the Razorjack that he drops.\n\nNote: Throughout this\
      \ part of the walkthrough you will find that Skaarj like to move about and run\
      \ off when they see you, bringing others back or leaving you confused. I cannot\
      \ cover it all so you'll have to take some initiative on this one; be prepared\
      \ for a surprise, then do what you think best.\n\nLook to the right from the\
      \ walkway you entered this corridor by. There's a locked door there, with a\
      \ brightly glowing readout over it [1].\n\nExercise caution in the next stretch\
      \ because there's another SkaarjTrooper with a Razorjack on patrol here somewhere.\
      \ When you meet him, you should kill him and take his Razorjack. Anyway, from\
      \ the locked door continue your anticlockwise journey round the Loop by going\
      \ the other way up the corridor and following its curve. Shortly you will meet\
      \ a SkaarjTrooper / [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Gunner|SkaarjGunner]] hybrid carrying\
      \ a [[Flak Cannon]], and maybe a [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Warrior|SkaarjWarrior]].\
      \ Kill both Skaarj then collect the Flak Cannon the SkaarjTrooper / SkaarjGunner\
      \ hybrid drops, then enter the area the Skaarj were guarding. This is a brief\
      \ detour from your journey round the Loop, but bear with me.\n\nThis area is\
      \ a set of ramps that go down in two stages and then under the Loop to come\
      \ out in the core room. There's little of interest in the core room itself,\
      \ but explore this ramp area for goodies.\n\nTake the ramp on the left and you\
      \ will find a Health Pack at the top. Continue down, and when you can, climb\
      \ a diagonal support on to a raised platform where you can pick up an [[Assault\
      \ Vest]] and another Health Pack. Drop down from there on to the flat half-way\
      \ stage where the ramp system doubles back on itself. If you go through a small\
      \ wall-opening there you will find a box of Razor Blades and an alcove containing\
      \ assorted gear, but the alcove is blocked off by a nasty electric field.\n\n\
      Go back out and down the lower ramp a little, turning back and climbing back\
      \ up the diagonal support strut to the right when you get the opportunity. Hop\
      \ over the hand rail and go into an alcove beneath the upper ramp on this side\
      \ for a Health Pack, a Flare, an ASMD Core and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Then,\
      \ go back out and across the ramp, clinbing over into another similar alcove\
      \ beneath the ramp opposite for another Health Pack, a Flak Shell and a box\
      \ of 8 Rifle Rounds. When you're done, return to the ramp.\n\nClimb back up\
      \ the ramps and re-join the Loop. Follow the Loop corridor to the right, resuming\
      \ your anticlockwise journey. After the corridor has curved round a while, you\
      \ can duck behind a panel for a box of Razor Blades. Follow the corridor as\
      \ it turns into another raised walkway over the core room, then go round it\
      \ unto another corridor away from the core with doors at the far end, where\
      \ alcoves along the side contain a can of 12 Eightballs, 40 Tarydium Shards\
      \ and a box of 50 Bullets. Go along and through the doors at the far end to\
      \ enter yet another room filled with large techno structures.\n\nThis room is\
      \ guarded by a SkaarjTrooper with a [[Dispersion Pistol]] and a [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Officer|SkaarjOfficer]]\
      \ with a [[Bio Rifle|GES Biorifle]]. Kill the two then collect the GES Biorifle\
      \ dropped by the SkaarjOfficer. Go round the edge of this room to collect two\
      \ cans of Tarydium Sludge and a box of 50 Bullets. Go through the doors out\
      \ of this room that were to the left as you entered. One corner and one Health\
      \ Pack later, and you are back at the top of the small lift you used right at\
      \ the start of the level. You've completed a circuit of the Loop.\n\nYou're\
      \ going to have to do some freelancing now. Remember that locked door with the\
      \ glowing message over it? Well, you have to go through there. But it'll only\
      \ open when you have killed all the Skaarj that this part of the level throws\
      \ at you. You have to complete several circuits of the Loop; you will find consistent\
      \ numbers of reinforcements in the form of [[Skaarj_Trooper#Skaarj_Infantry|SkaarjInfantry]]\
      \ with [[Stinger|Stingers]] and the occasional [[Skaarj_Warrior#Skaarj_Assassin|SkaarjAssassin]]\
      \ or SkaarjLord. Kill them all, none must escape. Collect any Stingers dropped\
      \ by the SkaarjInfantry.\n\nWith each circuit of the loop that you complete,\
      \ check the locked door. When you have killed enough Skaarj (if you are going\
      \ round the loop and meeting no Skaarj but the door still hasn't changed then\
      \ check the core room for any skulkers), you will see that the readout has vanished\
      \ and the door is in darkness. Shortly after that, it bursts open, revealing\
      \ a SkaarjOfficer with a Stinger and a SkaarjGunner with a Razorjack. Kill them.\n\
      \nWhen they are both dead and you have collected the Stinger and Razorjack that\
      \ they drop, go through the now open doors yourself and down the sloping corridor\
      \ beyond. At the bottom, you will reach a walkway over some fields where you\
      \ will fight and kill a SkaarjWarrior.\n\nGo along the walkway, collecting a\
      \ Health Pack along the way. Then, a curving corridor at the far end will lead\
      \ you via another Health Pack to another of those energy lifts. Step on it and\
      \ ride to the top. Step out at the top, and you are in a kind of science area\
      \ where you can go several ways; a SkaarjLord dozes on the right, so kill him.\
      \ Go to the right and into a small passage there for a Health Pack and 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards, but come straight back one you've collected the gear.\nReturning from\
      \ the small passage, drop off to the left into a recessed area where there are\
      \ cryopods by the walls. Collect of the Health Pack, box of 50 Bullets and box\
      \ of 10 Flak Shells there then activate and read the panel nearby [2].\n\nWhen\
      \ you're done here, go and press the button on the other side of the recess\
      \ to call a lift to take you back up to the main hallway above. Ride that lift\
      \ and turn left, going back past the top of the energy lift shaft and going\
      \ along to the door at the far end, which is blocked with a large readout over\
      \ it [3].\n\nFollow this area on round, forking to the left as you return from\
      \ the locked door. A forcefield on the left (by which there is a can of 12 Eightballs)\
      \ blocks the way back to an area you will recognise from MotherShip Lab. Continue\
      \ along and in the room beyond watch out for a SkaarjInfantry with a Stinger,\
      \ then go into the room's corners for 40 Tarydium Shards, a Health Pack and\
      \ an ASMD Core. You can see a [[Super Health Pack]] in a raised passage but\
      \ you can't reach it from here yet.\nA narrow passage (containing a Health Pack)\
      \ from the far corner of this area leads round to a raised crossroads of walkways\
      \ above a part of the Loop. Looking over to the right from this position you\
      \ will see the other mouth of the raised passage containing the Super Health\
      \ Pack - but you still can't get it.\n\nReturn to this crossroads from the passage\
      \ by the same access route, then look at the other exits. The rightermost one\
      \ leads back to the cryopods, so go instead to the one directly ahead. It is\
      \ locked with a readout [4].\n\nLook at the other exit. It too is locked with\
      \ a message [5].\n\nYou're not completely stumped though, as 45° anticlockwise\
      \ from here a forcefield bridge leads away from the crossroads.\n\nCross the\
      \ bridge into the area beyond. Alcoves on either side reveal a Health Pack and\
      \ a box of Razor Blades. Collect, then activate and read the panel at the back\
      \ [6].\n\nShoot the rear panel of the alcove where the Health Pack was. It will\
      \ lift up to reveal [[Jump Boots]]. Collect them, then return across the force\
      \ field bridge to the crossroads. You can now get the Super Health Pack - but\
      \ approach the Super Health Pack passage from the other end - you won't be able\
      \ to jump to it from here.\n\nReturn the crossroads and go to the entrance on\
      \ the other side to the left, which is now open. Go through into the passage\
      \ and approach a tempting Super Health Pack, but a door slams shut over it whilst\
      \ another opens to the right to reveal an angry SkaarjWarrior. Kill it, then\
      \ enter the room from which it emerged. This room contains a lift to a raised\
      \ walkway, but first visit alcoves in the room for two Flak Shells, a box of\
      \ 8 Rifle Rounds and two cans of Tarydium Sludge.\n\nTake the lift and make\
      \ a left as you step off at the top on to the raised walkway, entering another\
      \ small passage which curves round, leading to a Health Pack and a button. Press\
      \ the button. What it does is to re-open the hatch over the Super Health Pack\
      \ - but before going back down, go on to the raised walkway and enter the passage\
      \ at the other end. After a short curve with a Health Pack, you will be in a\
      \ room where purple laser beams oscillate across your view.\n\nThis bit's not\
      \ too tough, but save your game anyway. Then, go into the room and negotiate\
      \ the lasers - try not to get squished (I use the alcoves at the side and do\
      \ it step by step). Your reward at the far end is a Health Pack, a Shield Belt\
      \ and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Return through the beams, and drop to floor level\
      \ beneath the raised walkway.\n\nWith Invisibility on, this is just a run through.\n\
      \nGo out into the passage and turn right, collecting the Super Health Pack.\
      \ You are on a high ledge above the core room from earlier. As you approach,\
      \ a platform extends across the gap to a ledge on the other side - go across\
      \ and enter the small dark passage on the left, but beware the SkaarjWarrior\
      \ who attacks from the darkness.\n\nUse a light source to negotiate the corridor\
      \ and follow its curve on round. You will arrive in the Security Post - a room\
      \ full of panels guarded by a SkaarjAssassin in plain view and a SkaarjInfantry\
      \ with a Stinger round the corner. kill both Skaarj and collect the SkaarjInfantry's\
      \ Stinger. In doing so you will see a button in the area in which the SkaarjInfantry\
      \ was lurking, but don't press it yet - read the three panels in this area first\
      \ [7-9].\n\nNow it is time to press the button. So, do so. An alert siren goes\
      \ off and the panels change [10-12].\n\nSmall passages at either end of the\
      \ security post (you came in by one) lead you back out to the high ledges above\
      \ the core room. Take your pick. Then, go back out to the raised crossroads\
      \ and go round to the now open Primary Power Supply entrance (next one anticlockwise).\
      \ Look in through the entrance and kill the [[Brute]] on guard in the large\
      \ corridor beyond.\n\nEnter the corridor and go along. The corridor is lined\
      \ with gear as you proceed; a box of 8 Rifle Rounds, two boxes of 10 Flak Shells,\
      \ two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards, a Flare, two boxes of Razor Blades, two\
      \ cans of 12 Eightballs, two cans of Tarydium Sludge, two ASMD Cores and a Health\
      \ Pack. Beyond this gear, the corridor curves round and goes on inwards.\n\n\
      Follow the corridor on through the Mothership. Soon you will reach a junction\
      \ with a cache of gear behind a forcefield on the left, where a SkaarjWarrior\
      \ attacks from a continuation of the corridor to the right. Kill the Skaarj\
      \ - you're not going to get that forcefield open in a hurry, so go the other\
      \ way. After a curve, you will reach a pair of doors. Go through them to exit\
      \ the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"ACCESS DENIED: The Intruder must\
