      <p>In my opinion the other picture was better suitable. It shows the Mukhogg\
      \ on an icy background, its natural environment instead of on a man-made bridge\
      \ that isn't relevant to the animal or the planet so much. A screenshot from\
      \ UnrealEd showing the model unlighted on a background with grid doesn't really\
      \ add anything. Animation means GIF means the amount of colours is reduced to\
      \ a mere 256; the other is 32-bit. These versions are a bit dark and light respectively,\
      \ the other version was a more clear. Animation (not really the right word)\
      \ isn't needed here, and is in my opinion just distracting. OK, so far my opinion.&#160;:)\
