      /Unreal_II\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unreal II\">Unreal II</a>. It is\
      \ only found in the last mission and requires to damage a boss <a href=\"/Tosc\"\
      \ title=\"Tosc\">Tosc</a> severely to get the weapon. The Singularity Cannon\
      \ appears to be a natural feature of the Tosc, as it is obtainable only by shooting\
      \ an arm of a Tosc off. The Singularity Cannon can only hold one projectile\
      \ at a time and when picked gives the full clip - 667 projectiles. They appear\
      \ in the HUD as 1 in clip and 666 in backpack. As there is only one mission\
      \ this weapon can be used, one Singularity Cannon pickup is enough for the whole\
      \ game. There is no ammo pickup for the Singularity Cannon in the game as it\
      \ is not needed, but in botmatch maps the ammo, called Quantum Cores, can be\
      \ added, thus it doesn't have a model, appears like a 2D icon of bullets and\
      \ supplies only one projectile.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"\

      \ Instead, they are just thrown somewhere away and are still available to pick\
      \ up. Sometimes, after killing an opponent, gibs come back out of the black\
