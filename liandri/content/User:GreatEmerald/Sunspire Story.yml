      \ <a href=\"/Nali\" title=\"Nali\">Nali</a> and why the Skaarj didn't take them\
      \ to the mines?\n</p><p>Well I think I figured the answers to all of these questions.\n\
      </p><p>First, the moat. You can see that there are loads of <a href=\"/Titan\"\
      \ title=\"Titan\">titans</a> in the <a href=\"/Spire_Village\" title=\"Spire\
      \ Village\">Spire Village</a>. They are native of <a href=\"/Na_Pali\" title=\"\
      Na Pali\">Na Pali</a>, but they only rarely come to bash everyone around (At\
      \ the time of around 2213-2217 the Titans were hyperactive for some reason.\
      \ Maybe that is because the Skaarj managed to get them out of their dwellings?).\
      \ But the builders of the Sunspire knew that the Titans were a mighty threat\
      \ and therefore chose the Sunspire valley that had a natural moat of lava and\
      \ a small path going to a mountain (it originally was not as it is seen in the\
      \ year 2215 - the Nali changed some parts of the valley. The path was not even\
      \ as well, therefore the Nali came with the plank idea). The Titans are too\
      \ big to hold onto the small path and would simply be incinerated. Even if they\
      \ managed to walk on the path, the plank isn't strong enough to hold a Titan.\n\
      </p><p>There might have been another threat to the Nali at the Sunspire, and\
      \ that threat might have been small and walking on the ground. (It wasn't the\
      \ Skaarj, the Sunspire is a lot older than the Skaarj invasion. There are no\
      \ more native walking creatures - so maybe the Nali are not really that peaceful\
      \ and battle each other? The castles built by Nali might be defence from other\
      \ Nali as well.) That is why the Nali built the  gates to the Sunspire (a Nali\
      \ is big enough to use the key without a need to jump). It might have also been\
      \ used as a border guard. The plank could be used as a movable bridge so any\
      \ other ground enemies would be stopped.\nThe huge <a href=\"/Tarydium\" title=\"\
      Tarydium\">Tarydium</a> crystal was obviously not only used as a contact device\
      \ (the big Tarydium crystals can generate a very powerful beam that burns down\
      \ any mechanisms and even other things like living creatures). It was a weapon\
      \ against the Gasbags (native and can fly high enough to cross the mountains)\
      \ and probably the big Mantas. The Tentacles (native as well) were killed by\
      \ the Nali using knives in their early living stages.\n</p><p>The Skaarj attack\
      \ probably was like this: a few Skaarj <a href=\"/edit/Skimmer?redlink=1\" class=\"\
      new\" title=\"Skimmer (page does not exist)\">Skimmers</a> flew through the\
      \ Spire valley to the gates at the morning. The Nali saw the incoming Skaarj\
      \ and knew that they were around, so they didn't wait much and used their huge\
      \ Tarydium crystal to message their friends at the <a href=\"/Na_Pali_Haven\"\
      \ title=\"Na Pali Haven\">Na Pali Haven</a>, and also shot one Skimmer down.\
      \ The Skaarj had no choice but to land at the gates as the path is too small\
      \ for a good landing and the roof is defended by the Tarydium crystal. So the\
      \ rest of the Skimmers landed at the gates. The first wave of Skaarj didn't\
      \ go into the gate guard building, but tried assaulting the Sunspire building\
      \ itself. A Nali sacrificed himself and managed to throw the plank into the\
      \ lava before being gibbed by the Skaarj <a href=\"/Eightball_launcher\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Eightball launcher\">Eightball launchers</a>. This was\
      \ no threat to the Skaarj though, they used their portable forcefield generators\
      \ and made a bridge. Then they crossed the bridge and gained access to the Sunspire.\
      \ After that, they got directly to the Primary Ascension and took every Nali\
      \ they could see hostage. They didn't have time for looking into all of the\
      \ chambers there as they wanted to know the location of the Na Pali Haven. At\
      \ that time Nali were quickly evacuated from the Sunspire to the Na Pali haven.\
      \ Then the Skaarj got access to the cistern and some Skaarj figured out that\
      \ it was a great place for the Pupae to grow, and let off several Pupae. The\
      \ Skaarj then advanced to the Great Hall, used the turbo lifts, and saw a Sky\
      \ Elevator disembarking. They managed to throw in some grenades, but didn't\
      \ take the elevator down. At that time a part of the Skaarj took control of\
      \ the Tarydium crystal and shut it down. The Skaarj Skimmers then followed the\
      \ Elevator and got the location of the Na Pali Haven. Then all the Skaarj got\
      \ on the Skimmers, leaving only a few of them to guard the Pupae.\n</p><p>From\
      \ that day the Skaarj that were left didn't wander too far from the Pupae as\
      \ more and more Gasbags and Tentacles chose the empty Sunspire as their dwelling...\
      \ The few Nali that were left there had to hide, but fortunately the Skaarj\
      \ didn't search for them. After some time, the Pupae population increased and\
      \ spread over the upper floors of the Sunspire. The Skaarj even started to patrol\
      \ the path to the Sunspire, knowing that some humans can try to take control\
      \ of the building. They didn't touch the furniture in the first place as it\
      \ was a waste of time, and after that they were too afraid or just logically\
      \ saw the odds were overwhelming to go to the dark chambers full of Tentacles\
      \ and Gasbags.\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20221122131145\n\
