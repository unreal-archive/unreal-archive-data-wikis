      \ Rifle</a>. In either case it will still function as a <a href=\"/Hitscan\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hitscan\">hitscan</a> weapon. The weapon is\
      \ changed to no longer require ammo, meaning it has an infinite amount of shots.\n\
      </p><p>Instead of the usual blueish-purple beam, a powered up Shock Rifle will\
      \ shoot a red beam or, if used on the blue team in UT2003 or later, deep blue\
      \ beam. The weapon's alternate fire will function in exactly the same way, except\
      \ in the case of <a href=\"/Unreal_Tournament\" title=\"Unreal Tournament\"\
      >Unreal Tournament</a>'s <a href=\"/Assault\" title=\"Assault\">Assault</a>\
      \ gametype, where only the alternative fire can destroy objectives. In the case\
      \ of a powered up Sniper Rifle alternate will allow its user to zoom.\n</p><p>Depending\
      \ on the game and mutator, the Instagib Rifle's beam is either stopped as soon\
      \ as it hits an enemy player, or will burn right through every player it encounters,\
      \ allowing instant Multikill awards. In the original <a href=\"/Unreal_Tournament\"\
      \ title=\"Unreal Tournament\">Unreal Tournament</a> the beam caused a small\
      \ explosion at its point of impact. In Unreal Tournament 2003 and 2004, the\
      \ weapon can be used with a sniper scope as alternate fire, making it utterly\
      \ unstoppable at long range in the hands of a skilled sniper.\n</p><p>The Instagib\
      \ Rifle does a lot, but not an infinite amount of damage, making it possible\
      \ for characters with a lot of health to survive being hit, though this doesn't\
      \ feature in the regular game. In UT2003 and 2004, using the Booster adrenaline\
      \ combo to increase health and shield power to full can make the player survive\
      \ a single hit (because damage is only 300 points). In the original UT, this\
      \ is completely impossible, as the weapon deals somwhere around 16500 points\
      \ of damage.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Usage\">Usage</span><span\

      \ versions have been made by fans. In addition, one can spawn the weapon in\

      \ href=\"/edit/Instagib?section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Strategy\">edit</a><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Because of the Instagib\
      \ Rifle combines a slow reload time with huge firepower, both your and your\
      \ enemy's reload time are much more important than in normal games.\n</p><p>It\
      \ is not uncommon to see two beginning Instagib players enemies dancing around\
      \ each other taking shots in turn, because they are simply holding down the\
      \ fire button. Enemies that do this are easy to avoid getting killed by, simply\
      \ by realising the shots happen in a set \"rhythm\", making them easy to dodge\
      \ away at the last split second.\n</p><p>A better way at using the Instagib\
      \ Rifle is by waiting firing until you are sure your enemy is exactly in the\
      \ path of your Instagib beam. (Due to all players' high mobility, sometimes\
      \ this isn't an exact science.) One benefit is this is generally easier to accomplish\
      \ than trying to line up with enemies at the rhythm of your weapon with the\
      \ trigger continuously held. Another benefit is that this makes you much less\
      \ predictable. Since your enemy won't know exactly when you will fire, making\
      \ it harder for him to dodge away at the right time.\n</p><p>If you encounter\
      \ an enemy that holds the trigger, you can time when to concentrate on avoiding\
      \ his fire, and use the periods of time between his firing to return fire without\
      \ having to worry about being hit by that player.\n</p><p>In general it is advisable\
      \ to avoid running in straight lines, especially in long corridors, since enemy\
      \ players at either end won't have to adjust their aim much to hit players coming\
      \ straight towards them, or running straight away from them. This concept is\
      \ called <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfilade_and_defilade\"\
      >Enfilade</a>. For the same reason you should Dodge Jump and Double Jump (in\
      \ applicable games) with care.\n</p><p>Because being hit just once means dying\
      \ no matter how much health you have, taking a little falling damage or having\
      \ fallen into damaging slime have no impact on the game, unless you already\
      \ had little health.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Zoom_Instagib\"\
