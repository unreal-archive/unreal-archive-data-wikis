      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>This unusual Bombing Run arena is set high in the\
      \ sky on a series of catwalks. The arena consists of rusting metal structures\
      \ and grates and uses a seemingly simple lay-out. The teams spawn in between\
      \ the Goal and the Bomb. The Bomb is placed atop the central structure and can\
      \ be reached via a set of 2 lifts on both sides (as shown in the 2nd picture\
      \ at the bottom of this page) as well as from a walkway from the roof of the\
      \ spawnroom. The large tower on top of the central room is the only object that\
      \ somewhat obstructs the otherwise wide-open horizon in this map. As mentioned\
      \ before, the Goals are beyond the team's spawnpoints, on a rather desolate\
      \ location. There are no lethal consequences for jumping through the goal in\
      \ this map.\n</p><p>The quickest route from the spawnpoints to the bomb is via\
      \ the broad exit of the spawnroom. Then turn either left or right (which doesn't\
      \ matter due to the map's symmetrical lay-out) and then follow the roofed path\
      \ at the end. Halfway down this path is a lift which leads to the roof, with\
      \ the bomb on it. Alternatively, one can also translocate to the roof, making\
      \ the lift obsolete.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Weapons_.26_Pickups\"\

      <ul><li> This is one of the most \"open\" Bombing Run maps in the game. This,\
      \ in combination with it's limited size, provides fast and steady action.</li>\n\
      <li> Long shots work most effectively in this map. The only downside to this\
      \ strategy is the ease with which the ball will fall out of the level, making\
      \ it respawn in the middle. A bit of practice will compensate that risk though.</li>\n\
      <li> A steady aim and tactically placed teammates will get the Bomb from one\
      \ end to the other in 2-4 passes, and only a few seconds.</li>\n<li> Pickups\
      \ are low and defenses are weak in this level. The best point of defense is\
      \ near the exit of the lift from the spawnroom, using the Rocket Launcher right\
      \ next to the exit. This also partly bridges the gap caused by spawning a distance\
      \ form the Goal.</li>\n<li> The only pickup that isn't in the vicinity of the\
      \ Goals is the Shield Pack in the middle of the map. However, because it's distanced\
      \ from the Goals, and because defenders need to remain alert and ready every\
      \ moment of the game, this pickup is only really useful for those who happen\
      \ to be in the area.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Single-Player_tips\"\

      This unusual Bombing Run arena is set high in the sky on a series of catwalks.\
      \ The arena consists of rusting metal structures and grates and uses a seemingly\
      \ simple lay-out. The teams spawn in between the Goal and the Bomb. The Bomb\
      \ is placed atop the central structure and can be reached via a set of 2 lifts\
      \ on both sides (as shown in the 2nd picture at the bottom of this page) as\
      \ well as from a walkway from the roof of the spawnroom. The large tower on\
      \ top of the central room is the only object that somewhat obstructs the otherwise\
      \ wide-open horizon in this map. As mentioned before, the Goals are beyond the\
      \ team's spawnpoints, on a rather desolate location. There are no lethal consequences\
      \ for jumping through the goal in this map.\n\nThe quickest route from the spawnpoints\
      \ to the bomb is via the broad exit of the spawnroom. Then turn either left\
      \ or right (which doesn't matter due to the map's symmetrical lay-out) and then\
      \ follow the roofed path at the end. Halfway down this path is a lift which\
      \ leads to the roof, with the bomb on it. Alternatively, one can also translocate\
      \ to the roof, making the lift obsolete.\n\n==Weapons & Pickups==\n\n===Weapons===\n\

      \ of the most \"open\" Bombing Run maps in the game. This, in combination with\
      \ it's limited size, provides fast and steady action.\n* Long shots work most\
      \ effectively in this map. The only downside to this strategy is the ease with\
      \ which the ball will fall out of the level, making it respawn in the middle.\
      \ A bit of practice will compensate that risk though.\n* A steady aim and tactically\
      \ placed teammates will get the Bomb from one end to the other in 2-4 passes,\
      \ and only a few seconds.\n* Pickups are low and defenses are weak in this level.\
      \ The best point of defense is near the exit of the lift from the spawnroom,\
      \ using the Rocket Launcher right next to the exit. This also partly bridges\
      \ the gap caused by spawning a distance form the Goal.\n* The only pickup that\
      \ isn't in the vicinity of the Goals is the Shield Pack in the middle of the\
      \ map. However, because it's distanced from the Goals, and because defenders\
      \ need to remain alert and ready every moment of the game, this pickup is only\
      \ really useful for those who happen to be in the area.\n===Single-Player tips===\n\

      \ of BR-ElecFields.]]\n* BR-ElecFields was scheduled to be included in the retail\
      \ version of UT2003, but it got cut out because \"the shadows/decals were killing\
      \ it\" [http://www.beyondunreal.com/view_story.php?id=915 (source)] This version,\

      \ has left his signature on a wall.\n* The map was slated to appear in [[Unreal\
