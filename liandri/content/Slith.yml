      <p>Slith attack both on land and under water by simply rushing toward their\
      \ enemy while spitting powerful slime orbs and then finishing it with their\

      \ finishing humans in seconds. They are very aggressive and engage combat with\
      \ everyone. They also like to kill nearby Nali before the player has a chance\
      \ to engage them. Slith are best killed on land if possible. The <a href=\"\
