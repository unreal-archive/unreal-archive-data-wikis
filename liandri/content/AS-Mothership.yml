      \ but to the entire Unreal universe. For the first objectives the 2 teams use\
      \ space fighters to attack/defend. After this large-scale dogfight the teams\
      \ respawn inside the mothership where the attackers must attempt to make their\
      \ way to the ship's core and destabilize it. \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      Edit section: Objectives\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n\
      <dl><dt>Destroy Lower Shield Generator</dt>\n<dd> The first 3 objectives have\
      \ the players spawned in Space Fighters (<a href=\"/Human_Space_Fighter\" title=\"\
      Human Space Fighter\">Human Space Fighters</a> for the attackers and <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj_Space_Fighter\" title=\"Skaarj Space Fighter\">Skaarj Space Fighters</a>\
      \ for the defending team). The attackers must destroy the Lower Shield Core\
      \ which is located in the lower section of the ship. One way to get to the generator\
      \ is by entering the bottom of the ship. There's another shorter route via 2\
      \ narrow tunnels, of which the entrances are indicated by gray tongue-like objects\
      \ (on the outside of the lower half of the ship). This route is shorter, but\
      \ also has more defenses, including <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Plasma Turrets</a>.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending team\
      \ has 2x4 (2 for each entrance of the tunnels) turrets to use to protect the\
      \ upper hallways. These turrets are equipped with basic AI when unmanned. There\
      \ are more Plasma and Link Turrets spread over various crucial points of the\
      \ ship, all of which can fire at the attackers throughout the space battle.\
      \ The entry on the bottom of the ship is largely unprotected though.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Destroy Upper Shield Generator</dt>\n<dd> Now the attacking team must\
      \ destroy the 2 Upper Field Generators, which are located in a hallway in the\
      \ upper half of the ship. The entrances to this hallway are indicated by large\
      \ gray shapes sticking out of the ship. 2 other entrances can be found on the\
      \ roof near the other entrances. The narrow tunnels there lead to the hallway\
      \ with the generators inside. This route bypasses one of the generators, so\
      \ the attackers will only be able to fire at the other generator. A final route\
      \ is through the top of the ship. Although this route takes longer and requires\
      \ some handy maneuvers, it is also largely unprotected by turrets.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> Most of the new routes are protected by turrets. The hallway (with\
      \ the 2 Generators inside) is defended by 4 Energy Turrets (2 in the middle\
      \ and 1 at each entrance). The 2nd set of entrances (through the narrow tunnels)\
      \ is also protected by 2 <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"\
      Turrets\">Link Turrets</a> (each). The top route is largely unprotected. Despite\
      \ the heavier defenses the AI will almost always choose for the 1st set of entrances.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Proceed to Landing Bay</dt>\n<dd> After all the generators have been\
      \ destroyed the attackers must enter the ship. The entrance to the docking bay\
      \ is on the same level as the entrances to the hallway with the Upper Shield\
      \ Generators. Since the entrance to the Landing Bay is narrow, the Space Fighter\
      \ has to fly on its side to be able to fit through.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> There\
      \ is only 1 entrance to the loading bay, which is an advantage for the defending\
      \ team. Their disadvantage is that the defenders' ships spawn on the opposite\
      \ side of the ship. There are also 3 turrets (2 Energy Turrets and 1 Link Turret)\
      \ near the entrance of the Landing Bay that can be used in their defense.  \
      \  </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy Energy Bypass</dt>\n<dd> The attackers must now\
      \ destroy 2 Energy Bypass mechanisms. The doors on the ground-level lead to\
      \ a corridor leading to the mechanisms. There's also an elevator in the back\
      \ of the spawnroom which goes up to a path leading to the objective. The higher\
      \ ground of this route gives a better view on the Energy Bypasses, but it's\
      \ also more exposed to enemy fire.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending teams starts\
      \ with only a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>\
      \ and <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a>\
      \ in their weapon loadout, which is perfect for taking down the attackers. Additional\
      \ flak ammo and a health pack can be found on the 1st floor opposite of the\
      \ defender's spawnroom.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy Sentinels</dt>\n<dd> For\
      \ the next objective the attackers must destroy 3 weakened <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Sentinels</a>. These are all located on the same path. After\
      \ destroying the Energy Bypasses, the path splits. The left path leads to the\
      \ 1st Sentinel, the right path is a shortcut to the 2nd Sentinel and the lift\
      \ in the middle leads to the final Sentinel. These Sentinels, unlike the ones\
      \ often found near spawnpoints, only have 500 health. After all 3 have been\
      \ destroyed the path to the core is opened.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The Sentinels\
      \ are strong, but vulnerable turrets. They can provide some sort of back-up\
      \ for the defending team, but they're easily destroyed. The defender can only\
      \ stall the attackers by defeating them in 1on1 combat. The defenders can heal\
      \ the turrets with the link gun, but the healing rate is greatly reduced meaning\
      \ it they cant be healed nearly as fast as they can be destroyed unless the\
      \ whole team is healing them.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Use Panel to unlock Core Hatch</dt>\n\
      <dd> After the path has been cleared and a slow-moving door has been opened\
      \ the attackers must cross a bridge which is guarded by a Link Turret. This\
      \ turret can easily weaken an opponent, but swift movement and the coverage\
      \ of the crates should keep the attackers safe. After having crossed the bridge\
      \ the attackers must move through a hall and corridor before they reach the\
      \ Core's chamber. The Panels for the hatches are located right next to the Core,\
      \ in the middle of this room.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The bridge forms the first\
      \ point of defense. The Link Turret alone will likely not be enough to stall\
      \ the attacking team. Combined with additional backup this bridge can be used\
      \ to stall the attackers. the rest of the path to the core is a bit harder to\
      \ defend. The corridors leading to the core is the defending team's 2nd option,\
      \ but a number of crates in the hallway make it harder to defend.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dt>Destroy the Conductor</dt>\n<dd> The Core is now exposed and ready to\
      \ be destabilized. Destabilizing the core isn't the hardest part. Avoiding enemy\
      \ fire is. A few fully-loaded  alt-shots of the <a href=\"/Bio_Rifle\" title=\"\
      Bio Rifle\">Bio Rifle</a> is enough to complete the objective and finish the\
      \ match. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> Again, the only way to defend this objective is\
      \ by defeating the attackers in 1on1 combat. The attackers will likely be distracted\
      \ by trying to deal some damage to the Core, which should give the defenders\
      \ an advantage in combat. There are no pickups in the area to help the defenders.</dd></dl>\n\

      <dd> During the space battle a lot of the turrets and Space Fighters can be\
      \ avoided by taking some detours. Doing so will cost time, but will increase\
      \ the chances of survival. Once inside, all of the objectives are a combination\
      \ of fighting off defenders and destroying an object. Choosing to aim for the\
      \ objective may help reach the objective, but it may also result in a quicker\
      \ death. Focusing solely on the defender may increase one's lifespan, but it\
      \ won't help reach the objective. A good coordination between teammates and\
      \ division in priorities is the key to successful battles in these scenarios.</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> In the first stage of the assault with the space fighters, it helps\
      \ to have a high mouse sensitivity in order to make sharper turns to avoid enemy\
      \ missile attacks and maneuver easily in the inside of the mothership. A mouse\
      \ sensitivity value of about 7.0 is good enough to make your space fighter fly\
      \ rings around the upper shield generators.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Defensive</dt>\n\
      <dd> The Energy Turrets can operate themselves, so the defending team should\
      \ all man the fighters. They should chase down the attackers from the moment\
      \ they spawn. Also, when using the Skaarj Space Fighters, the defenders can\
      \ at any time return to the space craft bay to replace their fighters should\
      \ they take heavy damage on battle. If all else fails: Kamikaze by flying through\
      \ an opponent. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The rest of the objectives requires the\
      \ attackers to fire at something. Defenders should exploit this distraction\
      \ (as well as their advantage in weaponry) to stall the attackers. Narrow hallways\
      \ without much obstructions make good choke-points.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> As with\
      \ the attackers, having a high mouse sensitivity helps your space fighter to\
      \ make it more maneuverable.</dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ contact with the Skaarj came during the recovery of the prison transporter\
      \ [[UMS Vortex Rikers|Vortex Rikers]] on [[Na Pali]]. Within a year the Skaarj\
      \ had pushed humanity back to the brink of destruction. This scenario replicates\
      \ the final battle for Earth, and the stunning victory by humans in the face\
      \ of almost certain defeat. A Skaarj Mothership orbited the Earth, and rained\
      \ death upon the planet in preparation for the final landing. In a daring suicide\
      \ mission, the humans attacked the Skaarj Mothership in small one man fighters,\
      \ hoping to exploit a flaw in the Mothership defenses their analysis had revealed.\n\

      | game        = UT2004\n| gametype    = Assault\n}}\n\n==Map Description==\n\
      This map offers a twist not only to the assault gametype, but to the entire\
      \ Unreal universe. For the first objectives the 2 teams use space fighters to\
      \ attack/defend. After this large-scale dogfight the teams respawn inside the\
      \ mothership where the attackers must attempt to make their way to the ship's\
      \ core and destabilize it. \n\n==Objectives==\n;Destroy Lower Shield Generator\n\
      : The first 3 objectives have the players spawned in Space Fighters ([[Human\
      \ Space Fighter]]s for the attackers and [[Skaarj Space Fighter]]s for the defending\
      \ team). The attackers must destroy the Lower Shield Core which is located in\
      \ the lower section of the ship. One way to get to the generator is by entering\
      \ the bottom of the ship. There's another shorter route via 2 narrow tunnels,\
      \ of which the entrances are indicated by gray tongue-like objects (on the outside\
      \ of the lower half of the ship). This route is shorter, but also has more defenses,\
      \ including [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Plasma Turrets]].\n\n: The defending\
      \ team has 2x4 (2 for each entrance of the tunnels) turrets to use to protect\
      \ the upper hallways. These turrets are equipped with basic AI when unmanned.\
      \ There are more Plasma and Link Turrets spread over various crucial points\
      \ of the ship, all of which can fire at the attackers throughout the space battle.\
      \ The entry on the bottom of the ship is largely unprotected though.\n\n;Destroy\
      \ Upper Shield Generator\n: Now the attacking team must destroy the 2 Upper\
      \ Field Generators, which are located in a hallway in the upper half of the\
      \ ship. The entrances to this hallway are indicated by large gray shapes sticking\
      \ out of the ship. 2 other entrances can be found on the roof near the other\
      \ entrances. The narrow tunnels there lead to the hallway with the generators\
      \ inside. This route bypasses one of the generators, so the attackers will only\
      \ be able to fire at the other generator. A final route is through the top of\
      \ the ship. Although this route takes longer and requires some handy maneuvers,\
      \ it is also largely unprotected by turrets.\n\n: Most of the new routes are\
      \ protected by turrets. The hallway (with the 2 Generators inside) is defended\
      \ by 4 Energy Turrets (2 in the middle and 1 at each entrance). The 2nd set\
      \ of entrances (through the narrow tunnels) is also protected by 2 [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Link\
      \ Turrets]] (each). The top route is largely unprotected. Despite the heavier\
      \ defenses the AI will almost always choose for the 1st set of entrances.\n\n\
      ;Proceed to Landing Bay\n: After all the generators have been destroyed the\
      \ attackers must enter the ship. The entrance to the docking bay is on the same\
      \ level as the entrances to the hallway with the Upper Shield Generators. Since\
      \ the entrance to the Landing Bay is narrow, the Space Fighter has to fly on\
      \ its side to be able to fit through.\n\n: There is only 1 entrance to the loading\
      \ bay, which is an advantage for the defending team. Their disadvantage is that\
      \ the defenders' ships spawn on the opposite side of the ship. There are also\
      \ 3 turrets (2 Energy Turrets and 1 Link Turret) near the entrance of the Landing\
      \ Bay that can be used in their defense.    \n\n;Destroy Energy Bypass\n: The\
      \ attackers must now destroy 2 Energy Bypass mechanisms. The doors on the ground-level\
      \ lead to a corridor leading to the mechanisms. There's also an elevator in\
      \ the back of the spawnroom which goes up to a path leading to the objective.\
      \ The higher ground of this route gives a better view on the Energy Bypasses,\
      \ but it's also more exposed to enemy fire.\n\n: The defending teams starts\
      \ with only a [[Flak Cannon]] and [[Rocket Launcher]] in their weapon loadout,\
      \ which is perfect for taking down the attackers. Additional flak ammo and a\
      \ health pack can be found on the 1st floor opposite of the defender's spawnroom.\n\
      \n;Destroy Sentinels\n: For the next objective the attackers must destroy 3\
      \ weakened [[Turrets#Unreal Tournament 2004|Sentinels]]. These are all located\
      \ on the same path. After destroying the Energy Bypasses, the path splits. The\
      \ left path leads to the 1st Sentinel, the right path is a shortcut to the 2nd\
      \ Sentinel and the lift in the middle leads to the final Sentinel. These Sentinels,\
      \ unlike the ones often found near spawnpoints, only have 500 health. After\
      \ all 3 have been destroyed the path to the core is opened.\n\n: The Sentinels\
      \ are strong, but vulnerable turrets. They can provide some sort of back-up\
      \ for the defending team, but they're easily destroyed. The defender can only\
      \ stall the attackers by defeating them in 1on1 combat. The defenders can heal\
      \ the turrets with the link gun, but the healing rate is greatly reduced meaning\
      \ it they cant be healed nearly as fast as they can be destroyed unless the\
      \ whole team is healing them.\n\n;Use Panel to unlock Core Hatch\n: After the\
      \ path has been cleared and a slow-moving door has been opened the attackers\
      \ must cross a bridge which is guarded by a Link Turret. This turret can easily\
      \ weaken an opponent, but swift movement and the coverage of the crates should\
      \ keep the attackers safe. After having crossed the bridge the attackers must\
      \ move through a hall and corridor before they reach the Core's chamber. The\
      \ Panels for the hatches are located right next to the Core, in the middle of\
      \ this room.\n\n: The bridge forms the first point of defense. The Link Turret\
      \ alone will likely not be enough to stall the attacking team. Combined with\
      \ additional backup this bridge can be used to stall the attackers. the rest\
      \ of the path to the core is a bit harder to defend. The corridors leading to\
      \ the core is the defending team's 2nd option, but a number of crates in the\
      \ hallway make it harder to defend.\n\n;Destroy the Conductor\n: The Core is\
      \ now exposed and ready to be destabilized. Destabilizing the core isn't the\
      \ hardest part. Avoiding enemy fire is. A few fully-loaded  alt-shots of the\
      \ [[Bio Rifle]] is enough to complete the objective and finish the match. \n\
      \n: Again, the only way to defend this objective is by defeating the attackers\
      \ in 1on1 combat. The attackers will likely be distracted by trying to deal\
      \ some damage to the Core, which should give the defenders an advantage in combat.\
      \ There are no pickups in the area to help the defenders.\n\n== Weapons & Pickups\
      \ ==\n{{sectstub}}\n=== Weapons ===\n=== Pickups ===\n* 2x Shield Pack (one\
      \ near attacker's first spawn point, the other near the attacker's spawn points\
      \ before the bridges)\n=== Vehicles and turrets ===\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n;Offensive\n\
      : During the space battle a lot of the turrets and Space Fighters can be avoided\
      \ by taking some detours. Doing so will cost time, but will increase the chances\
      \ of survival. Once inside, all of the objectives are a combination of fighting\
      \ off defenders and destroying an object. Choosing to aim for the objective\
      \ may help reach the objective, but it may also result in a quicker death. Focusing\
      \ solely on the defender may increase one's lifespan, but it won't help reach\
      \ the objective. A good coordination between teammates and division in priorities\
      \ is the key to successful battles in these scenarios.\n\n: In the first stage\
      \ of the assault with the space fighters, it helps to have a high mouse sensitivity\
      \ in order to make sharper turns to avoid enemy missile attacks and maneuver\
      \ easily in the inside of the mothership. A mouse sensitivity value of about\
      \ 7.0 is good enough to make your space fighter fly rings around the upper shield\
      \ generators.\n\n;Defensive\n: The Energy Turrets can operate themselves, so\
      \ the defending team should all man the fighters. They should chase down the\
      \ attackers from the moment they spawn. Also, when using the Skaarj Space Fighters,\
      \ the defenders can at any time return to the space craft bay to replace their\
      \ fighters should they take heavy damage on battle. If all else fails: Kamikaze\
      \ by flying through an opponent. \n\n: The rest of the objectives requires the\
      \ attackers to fire at something. Defenders should exploit this distraction\
      \ (as well as their advantage in weaponry) to stall the attackers. Narrow hallways\
      \ without much obstructions make good choke-points.\n\n: As with the attackers,\
      \ having a high mouse sensitivity helps your space fighter to make it more maneuverable.\n\
