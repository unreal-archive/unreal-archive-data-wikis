      \ walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n</p><p>You start in the torchlit\
      \ hall you entered at the end of the previous level. Nothing of interest here\
      \ except for another set of doors ahead. Go through the doors. You emerge on\
      \ a covered platform at the end of a lake. A <a href=\"/Nali\" title=\"Nali\"\
      >Nali</a> stands on the platform praying. Shoot open barrels on the platform\
      \ for a Clip and a can of 12 Eightballs. Go to the edge of the platform and\
      \ look out across the water.\n</p><p>This end of the lake curves round to the\
      \ left. Ahead you can see a Nali structure on stilts in the water that is similar\
      \ to the ones you saw before night fell. Drop into the water now and swim towards\
      \ the stilted gazebo. Reaching the stilts, you will see a lift at water level\
      \ in the center. Climb out on to the lift and let it take you up into the gazebo.\
      \ Step off the lift at the top.\nUp in the gazebo there's an <a href=\"/ASMD\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a> Core lying loose. Collect it\
      \ then shoot barrels open for a <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flare</a>,\
      \ a <a href=\"/Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health Pack\">Health\
      \ Pack</a> and 40 <a href=\"/Tarydium\" title=\"Tarydium\">Tarydium</a> Shards.\
      \ Then, from your high vantage point, look around the valley. The lake continues\
      \ off to the left. Ahead is a portion of solid ground on which there are <a\
      \ href=\"/UMS\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UMS\">UMS</a> drop boxes and a\
      \ <a href=\"/Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a>Infantry with a Stinger on\
      \ guard - he won't see you yet. Use the <a href=\"/ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a> in primary fire to attack him - that'll wake him up.\n\
      </p><p>When the Skaarj is dead or has run off, drop into the water and climb\
      \ out on the solid ground. Go first behind the plant on the left for two <a\
      \ href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a>,\
      \ then shoot the three UMS drop boxes open for a 50 bullet CAR Clip, 10 Rockets\
      \ and a <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a>.\
      \ Climb the slope of the land here and spy out the environment ahead. You will\
      \ see a large expanse of flat ground on which there is a <a href=\"/Titan\"\
      \ title=\"Titan\">Titan</a> that does not see you. You may also see a Skaarj\
      \ on patrol, but leave it alone if it does not spot you.\n</p><p>Retreat to\
      \ the water's edge and drop back in. Follow the lake as it continues through\
      \ the valley. Underwater as you round a corner, you will see the Skyelevator\
      \ from <a href=\"/The_Sunspire\" title=\"The Sunspire\">the Sunspire</a> half\
      \ buried in the mud, evidently crashed. Two dead human bodies lie sprawled on\
      \ the floor of the lake nearby. Collect the half-buried <a href=\"/Automag\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a> between them then read\
      \ their logs [1] and [2].\n</p><p>Continue swimming along the valley. Passing\
      \ a tower near the crashed Skyelevator, you will soon see another slope of land\
      \ ahead. But ignore this and continue through the lake. Passing another tower,\
      \ you will soon sight another gazebo. Swim to the gazebo and ride the lift to\
      \ the top. In the gazebo, a Nali Priest prays. Leave him alone and open barrels\
      \ for a Health Pack, a Nali Fruit Seed and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Look around.\n\
      </p><p>The lake continues further on round the winding valley, but don't go\
      \ that way yet. Instead, go to the edge of the gazebo facing back the way you\
      \ came and you will see that the sloping path you saw just now that winds round\
      \ the cliff in this area drops to water level as it heads for the flat expanse\
      \ of land you saw earlier. Jump out of the gazebo and head for the flat ground.\n\
      </p><p>Climb out and head along the flat ground. Look out for a SkaarjTrooper\
      \ with a <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion\
      \ Pistol</a> on patrol. When the Skaarj is dead, continue towards the large\
      \ rock ahead. Collect a Nali Healing Fruit from beside a large plant to the\
      \ right. You will soon find yourself approaching the large flat plain you saw\
      \ earlier. Although the large rock partly blocks your view, you will see the\
      \ Titan to the left of the rock, so yourself go to the right of the rock.\n\
      </p><p>You will emerge back at the base of the slope down from the place where\
      \ you first emerged from the water and destroyed the drop boxes. It's time to\
      \ tackle the Titan now, so ready your <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"\
      Rocket Launcher\">Rocket Launcher</a> (oh for an Eightball...). A rocket up\
      \ the backside will soon attract the big monster's attention, so fire away.\
      \ Then, using that large rock as cover from the Titan's boulders, fill it with\
      \ rockets and then grenades until it moans and collapses. Be careful when strafing\
      \ round the rock, because you may attract the attention of a SkaarjTrooper with\
      \ a Dispersion Pistol in a nearby gazebo. Be it during or after the Titan fight,\
      \ dispose of the Skaarj too.\n</p><p>Now that you've dealt with the immediate\
      \ threat, go over to the pool containing the gazebo from which the Skaarj jumped\
      \ down. Go first underwater and open a UMS drop box there for a 50 bullet CAR\
      \ Clip, then use the lift to rise up into the gazebo and open barrels for a\
      \ Clip, a Health Pack and an ASMD Core.\nThere are two more aspects of this\
      \ part of the valley that you have not yet explored. Look out of the side of\
      \ the gazebo that faces away from the large rock you emerged from behind to\
      \ enter this area. You will see a pair of Nali huts. Drop out of the gazebo\
      \ and head for the huts. The huts are dark, so using your Searchlight, enter\
      \ the first.\n</p><p>A useful <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a> lies in the corner with a barrel that\
      \ contains a Health Pack. Collect the gear then open other barrels for a Clip.\
      \ Leave the hut and approach the second one. Go in - inside you will find two\
      \ cans of 12 Eightballs and barrels containing a Clip, 40 Tarydium Shards and\
      \ a Health Pack.\n</p><p>Leave the hut and head round to the right of another\
      \ large rock at this side of the valley. Near the foot of the cliff further\
      \ round, you will find a SkaarjInfantry with a <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"\
      Stinger\">Stinger</a> lurking by wooden crates. Kill the Skaarj and take the\
      \ Stinger he drops, then open the crates for 40 more Tarydium Shards. Collect\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit from beneath a nearby plant.\n</p><p>Continue round behind\
      \ the rock. Eventually you will emerge at the back of the flat expanse of ground\
      \ at the base of a canyon that slopes upwards. There's a UMS drop box here which\
      \ you can shoot open for a 50 bullet CAR Clip. You will see more drop boxes\
      \ up the canyon, so head on up the canyon, opening a drop box on the way for\
      \ 10 Rockets. There's a Nali Healing Fruit on the right at this point. Shortly\
      \ you will reach a point where two more drop boxes reveal a <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a>\
      \ and another 50 bullet CAR Clip. Collect these but then STOP - haven't you\
      \ missed something?\n</p><p>There is a strange structure ahead that looks significant,\
      \ but don't approach it yet. Think back to earlier in the map... you saw the\
      \ lake continuing round and a footpath sloping up round the cliff. You didn't\
      \ explore that area. So, turn around (trust me, this is the best order to do\
      \ things in) and go back down the canyon. Veer to the right around a medium-sized\
      \ rock at the bottom and shoot open a UMS drop box that you missed earlier to\
      \ retrieve its <a href=\"/Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"Grenade Launcher\">Grenade\
      \ Launcher</a>. Continue to stick to the cliff on the right and you will pass\
      \ the large rock you used as cover from the Titan, before returning shortly\
      \ to where you climbed out of the lake for the second time.\n</p><p>From this\
      \ position, the footpath slopes up and winds round the cliff as it follows the\
      \ edge of the lake. Climb the sloping ground, following the path's curvature.\
      \ At the top of the slope, you can collect a Nali Healing Fruit from the base\
      \ of a torch before the ground slopes down again. Follow the path right down\
      \ to the bottom. You will be at a junction where a tall narrow canyon leads\
      \ back up to the right while a water-level plateau spreads out to the left.\
      \ Go to the left on to the plateau but beware a SkaarjInfantry with an ASMD\
      \ lurking by a torch whom you should kill. Once the Skaarj is dead, keep a look\
      \ out for a group of six <a href=\"/Pack_Hunter\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"\
      Pack Hunter\">Pack Hunters</a> that patrol this area.\n</p><p>Once all threats\
      \ have been neutralized, drop into this end of the lake to find a UMS drop box\
      \ containing a Combat Assault Rifle. Then climb back out and approach the wooden\
      \ crates the Skaarj was guarding and open them for an ASMD Core.\nYou will see\
      \ that the plateau opens out and extends for a long way, but is divided here\
      \ into two routes by a large rock. Take the route on the left and follow the\
      \ rock round - you will soon see a building in the distance. Keep your eyes\
      \ open for those Pack Hunters.\n</p><p>Approach the building. You will be in\
      \ front of the main entrance, but don't go in that way, go round to the right\
      \ of the building and follow its walls round to the back. Soon, as you arrive\
      \ round the back of the building, you will see a ramp up to a balcony. Go beneath\
      \ the ramp to collect of two Nali Healing Fruit you find there. Climb the ramp\
      \ itself now to the balcony. The balcony runs round the end wall; in the end\
      \ wall you will see a doorway behind which a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion\
      \ Pistol is crouched.\n</p><p>Surprise the Skaarj with a Flak Shell up its backside\
      \ - but expect to be surprised yourself as from a balcony round the corner appear\
      \ another SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol and a SkaarjInfantry with a\
      \ <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>. Kill them\
      \ both and be sure to collect the Flak Cannon dropped by the SkaarjInfantry\
      \ at some point. Look around.\n</p><p>You are on a balcony inside the building.\
      \ Below, the building is clearly being used by the Skaarj as a storage facility\
      \ of some kind. There are various items on top of the storage crates and on\
      \ the floor but ignore them for the moment. Instead, step on the beam that leads\
      \ away from the balcony into the room. Follow it until it turns into a cross\
      \ beam in the next part of the building. Follow the cross beam to the right\
      \ to access the balcony where the other Skaarj were lurking. Shoot wooden crates\
      \ there open for a box of 10 Flak Shells.\n</p><p>From here, ostensibly the\
      \ items available on top of the crates are a can of 12 Eightballs and a Dispersion\
      \ Pistol Powerup. However, drop instead on to the stacks of crates nearest where\
      \ the crate that had contained the Flak Shells was positioned. On the crates,\
      \ go into the corner under the balcony for a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>.\n</p><p>Before going out\
      \ and back up to collect the other items from on top of the storage boxes, drop\
      \ down to the floor and follow the red carpet to the left. You will reach an\
      \ Eightball Gun at the end of the room (which was evidently some kind of chapel\
      \ originally) between two monk statues.\n</p><p>Return to the main part of the\
      \ room with the torch in the center. The exit should be on your left. Go to\
      \ the right into the back part of the room. Behind the Shield Belt crates are\
      \ two ASMD Cores, and two barrels opposite reveal a Clip and a Flare. Almost\
      \ time to leave. But first, collect 40 Tarydium Shards from the left of the\
      \ exit. Then, go outside and go back round to the ramps behind the building.\
      \ Re-enter the building from the balcony so that you can drop down on to crates\
      \ on the left for a can of 12 Eightballs. If you're good, you can jump round\
      \ the corner to the next crate which carries a Dispersion Pistol Powerup. If\
      \ not, then go back round via the ramps once more.\n</p><p>When you've left\
      \ the building for the last time, it's time to press on and leave this part\
      \ of the valley. If you need health though, first make a hard right from the\
      \ building and walk such that you are heading towards the Sunspire mountain\
      \ (which can be seen beyond the cliffs). You will approach a torch and soon\
      \ see two Nali Healing Fruit at the base of a rock to the right.\n</p><p>Time\
      \ to get going. You need to return to the area by the lake. If you've lost your\
      \ bearings, then the route you want is pretty much straight on from the exit\
      \ of the chapel then off to the left when you reach the cliff.\n</p><p>Once\
      \ back at the lake's edge, head up the tall narrow canyon you noticed earlier\
      \ (straight on as you return to the lake). It slopes uphill, taking you gently\
      \ back to the right. There's another Nali Healing Fruit to the right of a rock\
      \ at the bottom of the canyon if you need it.\n</p><p>As you ascend the slope\
      \ you will encounter a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol. Make sure it\
      \ is suitably disposed of. Near the top of the canyon (which in itself reveals\
      \ nothing of great value) you will spot another Titan. While you are still at\
      \ a distance and the Titan hasn't spotted you, load up six rockets and fire\
      \ them in a tight circle to get first strike. Then, do the usual job of dodging\
      \ boulders and backing off until the Titan is dead.\n</p><p>When you have finished\
      \ the Titan off, go up to the top of the canyon (there's another Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit to the left of a rock near the top). Once the canyon opens out you will\
      \ realize that you are back near the strange structure you saw earlier. The\
      \ other canyon you came up leads down to the right.\n</p><p>You're ready to\
      \ proceed. Approach the structure and go to the right of a rock at the very\
      \ top to surprise a crouching SkaarjOfficer carrying an ASMD. Kill him and collect\
      \ the ASMD he drops. If you need any health, go to the far right of the structure\
      \ and collect the Nali Healing Fruit in the corner. Then, go round to the front\
      \ of the structure and go through the doorway there into a small forecourt.\
      \ There's another Nali Healing Fruit on the left in the forecourt. Approach\
      \ the door to the structure which has inscriptions either side that read [3].\n\
      </p><p>The doors open as you approach. Step through. Within the structure, go\
      \ through another set of doors ahead to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \n\n\n== Walkthrough ==\n''This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty.\
      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\n\
      You start in the torchlit hall you entered at the end of the previous level.\
      \ Nothing of interest here except for another set of doors ahead. Go through\
      \ the doors. You emerge on a covered platform at the end of a lake. A [[Nali]]\
      \ stands on the platform praying. Shoot open barrels on the platform for a Clip\
      \ and a can of 12 Eightballs. Go to the edge of the platform and look out across\
      \ the water.\n\nThis end of the lake curves round to the left. Ahead you can\
      \ see a Nali structure on stilts in the water that is similar to the ones you\
      \ saw before night fell. Drop into the water now and swim towards the stilted\
      \ gazebo. Reaching the stilts, you will see a lift at water level in the center.\
      \ Climb out on to the lift and let it take you up into the gazebo. Step off\
      \ the lift at the top.\nUp in the gazebo there's an [[ASMD]] Core lying loose.\
      \ Collect it then shoot barrels open for a [[Flare]], a [[Health Pack]] and\
      \ 40 [[Tarydium]] Shards. Then, from your high vantage point, look around the\
      \ valley. The lake continues off to the left. Ahead is a portion of solid ground\
      \ on which there are [[UMS]] drop boxes and a [[Skaarj]]Infantry with a Stinger\
      \ on guard - he won't see you yet. Use the [[ASMD]] in primary fire to attack\
      \ him - that'll wake him up.\n\nWhen the Skaarj is dead or has run off, drop\
      \ into the water and climb out on the solid ground. Go first behind the plant\
      \ on the left for two [[Nali Healing Fruit]], then shoot the three UMS drop\
      \ boxes open for a 50 bullet CAR Clip, 10 Rockets and a [[Rocket Launcher]].\
      \ Climb the slope of the land here and spy out the environment ahead. You will\
      \ see a large expanse of flat ground on which there is a [[Titan]] that does\
      \ not see you. You may also see a Skaarj on patrol, but leave it alone if it\
      \ does not spot you.\n\nRetreat to the water's edge and drop back in. Follow\
      \ the lake as it continues through the valley. Underwater as you round a corner,\
      \ you will see the Skyelevator from [[the Sunspire]] half buried in the mud,\
      \ evidently crashed. Two dead human bodies lie sprawled on the floor of the\
      \ lake nearby. Collect the half-buried [[Automag]] between them then read their\
      \ logs [1] and [2].\n\nContinue swimming along the valley. Passing a tower near\
      \ the crashed Skyelevator, you will soon see another slope of land ahead. But\
      \ ignore this and continue through the lake. Passing another tower, you will\
      \ soon sight another gazebo. Swim to the gazebo and ride the lift to the top.\
      \ In the gazebo, a Nali Priest prays. Leave him alone and open barrels for a\
      \ Health Pack, a Nali Fruit Seed and a box of 10 Flak Shells. Look around.\n\
      \nThe lake continues further on round the winding valley, but don't go that\
      \ way yet. Instead, go to the edge of the gazebo facing back the way you came\
      \ and you will see that the sloping path you saw just now that winds round the\
      \ cliff in this area drops to water level as it heads for the flat expanse of\
      \ land you saw earlier. Jump out of the gazebo and head for the flat ground.\n\
      \nClimb out and head along the flat ground. Look out for a SkaarjTrooper with\
      \ a [[Dispersion Pistol]] on patrol. When the Skaarj is dead, continue towards\
      \ the large rock ahead. Collect a Nali Healing Fruit from beside a large plant\
      \ to the right. You will soon find yourself approaching the large flat plain\
      \ you saw earlier. Although the large rock partly blocks your view, you will\
      \ see the Titan to the left of the rock, so yourself go to the right of the\
      \ rock.\n\nYou will emerge back at the base of the slope down from the place\
      \ where you first emerged from the water and destroyed the drop boxes. It's\
      \ time to tackle the Titan now, so ready your [[Rocket Launcher]] (oh for an\
      \ Eightball...). A rocket up the backside will soon attract the big monster's\
      \ attention, so fire away. Then, using that large rock as cover from the Titan's\
      \ boulders, fill it with rockets and then grenades until it moans and collapses.\
      \ Be careful when strafing round the rock, because you may attract the attention\
      \ of a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol in a nearby gazebo. Be it during\
      \ or after the Titan fight, dispose of the Skaarj too.\n\nNow that you've dealt\
      \ with the immediate threat, go over to the pool containing the gazebo from\
      \ which the Skaarj jumped down. Go first underwater and open a UMS drop box\
      \ there for a 50 bullet CAR Clip, then use the lift to rise up into the gazebo\
      \ and open barrels for a Clip, a Health Pack and an ASMD Core.\nThere are two\
      \ more aspects of this part of the valley that you have not yet explored. Look\
      \ out of the side of the gazebo that faces away from the large rock you emerged\
      \ from behind to enter this area. You will see a pair of Nali huts. Drop out\
      \ of the gazebo and head for the huts. The huts are dark, so using your Searchlight,\
      \ enter the first.\n\nA useful [[Assault Vest]] lies in the corner with a barrel\
      \ that contains a Health Pack. Collect the gear then open other barrels for\
      \ a Clip. Leave the hut and approach the second one. Go in - inside you will\
      \ find two cans of 12 Eightballs and barrels containing a Clip, 40 Tarydium\
      \ Shards and a Health Pack.\n\nLeave the hut and head round to the right of\
      \ another large rock at this side of the valley. Near the foot of the cliff\
      \ further round, you will find a SkaarjInfantry with a [[Stinger]] lurking by\
      \ wooden crates. Kill the Skaarj and take the Stinger he drops, then open the\
      \ crates for 40 more Tarydium Shards. Collect a Nali Healing Fruit from beneath\
      \ a nearby plant.\n\nContinue round behind the rock. Eventually you will emerge\
      \ at the back of the flat expanse of ground at the base of a canyon that slopes\
      \ upwards. There's a UMS drop box here which you can shoot open for a 50 bullet\
      \ CAR Clip. You will see more drop boxes up the canyon, so head on up the canyon,\
      \ opening a drop box on the way for 10 Rockets. There's a Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ on the right at this point. Shortly you will reach a point where two more\
      \ drop boxes reveal a [[Combat Assault Rifle]] and another 50 bullet CAR Clip.\
      \ Collect these but then STOP - haven't you missed something?\n\nThere is a\
      \ strange structure ahead that looks significant, but don't approach it yet.\
      \ Think back to earlier in the map... you saw the lake continuing round and\
      \ a footpath sloping up round the cliff. You didn't explore that area. So, turn\
      \ around (trust me, this is the best order to do things in) and go back down\
      \ the canyon. Veer to the right around a medium-sized rock at the bottom and\
      \ shoot open a UMS drop box that you missed earlier to retrieve its [[Grenade\
      \ Launcher]]. Continue to stick to the cliff on the right and you will pass\
      \ the large rock you used as cover from the Titan, before returning shortly\
      \ to where you climbed out of the lake for the second time.\n\nFrom this position,\
      \ the footpath slopes up and winds round the cliff as it follows the edge of\
      \ the lake. Climb the sloping ground, following the path's curvature. At the\
      \ top of the slope, you can collect a Nali Healing Fruit from the base of a\
      \ torch before the ground slopes down again. Follow the path right down to the\
      \ bottom. You will be at a junction where a tall narrow canyon leads back up\
      \ to the right while a water-level plateau spreads out to the left. Go to the\
      \ left on to the plateau but beware a SkaarjInfantry with an ASMD lurking by\
      \ a torch whom you should kill. Once the Skaarj is dead, keep a look out for\
      \ a group of six [[Pack Hunter]]s that patrol this area.\n\nOnce all threats\
      \ have been neutralized, drop into this end of the lake to find a UMS drop box\
      \ containing a Combat Assault Rifle. Then climb back out and approach the wooden\
      \ crates the Skaarj was guarding and open them for an ASMD Core.\nYou will see\
      \ that the plateau opens out and extends for a long way, but is divided here\
      \ into two routes by a large rock. Take the route on the left and follow the\
      \ rock round - you will soon see a building in the distance. Keep your eyes\
      \ open for those Pack Hunters.\n\nApproach the building. You will be in front\
      \ of the main entrance, but don't go in that way, go round to the right of the\
      \ building and follow its walls round to the back. Soon, as you arrive round\
      \ the back of the building, you will see a ramp up to a balcony. Go beneath\
      \ the ramp to collect of two Nali Healing Fruit you find there. Climb the ramp\
      \ itself now to the balcony. The balcony runs round the end wall; in the end\
      \ wall you will see a doorway behind which a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion\
      \ Pistol is crouched.\n\nSurprise the Skaarj with a Flak Shell up its backside\
      \ - but expect to be surprised yourself as from a balcony round the corner appear\
      \ another SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol and a SkaarjInfantry with a\
      \ [[Flak Cannon]]. Kill them both and be sure to collect the Flak Cannon dropped\
      \ by the SkaarjInfantry at some point. Look around.\n\nYou are on a balcony\
      \ inside the building. Below, the building is clearly being used by the Skaarj\
      \ as a storage facility of some kind. There are various items on top of the\
      \ storage crates and on the floor but ignore them for the moment. Instead, step\
      \ on the beam that leads away from the balcony into the room. Follow it until\
      \ it turns into a cross beam in the next part of the building. Follow the cross\
      \ beam to the right to access the balcony where the other Skaarj were lurking.\
      \ Shoot wooden crates there open for a box of 10 Flak Shells.\n\nFrom here,\
      \ ostensibly the items available on top of the crates are a can of 12 Eightballs\
      \ and a Dispersion Pistol Powerup. However, drop instead on to the stacks of\
      \ crates nearest where the crate that had contained the Flak Shells was positioned.\
      \ On the crates, go into the corner under the balcony for a [[Shield Belt]].\n\
      \nBefore going out and back up to collect the other items from on top of the\
      \ storage boxes, drop down to the floor and follow the red carpet to the left.\
      \ You will reach an Eightball Gun at the end of the room (which was evidently\
      \ some kind of chapel originally) between two monk statues.\n\nReturn to the\
      \ main part of the room with the torch in the center. The exit should be on\
      \ your left. Go to the right into the back part of the room. Behind the Shield\
      \ Belt crates are two ASMD Cores, and two barrels opposite reveal a Clip and\
      \ a Flare. Almost time to leave. But first, collect 40 Tarydium Shards from\
      \ the left of the exit. Then, go outside and go back round to the ramps behind\
      \ the building. Re-enter the building from the balcony so that you can drop\
      \ down on to crates on the left for a can of 12 Eightballs. If you're good,\
      \ you can jump round the corner to the next crate which carries a Dispersion\
      \ Pistol Powerup. If not, then go back round via the ramps once more.\n\nWhen\
      \ you've left the building for the last time, it's time to press on and leave\
      \ this part of the valley. If you need health though, first make a hard right\
      \ from the building and walk such that you are heading towards the Sunspire\
      \ mountain (which can be seen beyond the cliffs). You will approach a torch\
      \ and soon see two Nali Healing Fruit at the base of a rock to the right.\n\n\
      Time to get going. You need to return to the area by the lake. If you've lost\
      \ your bearings, then the route you want is pretty much straight on from the\
      \ exit of the chapel then off to the left when you reach the cliff.\n\nOnce\
      \ back at the lake's edge, head up the tall narrow canyon you noticed earlier\
      \ (straight on as you return to the lake). It slopes uphill, taking you gently\
      \ back to the right. There's another Nali Healing Fruit to the right of a rock\
      \ at the bottom of the canyon if you need it.\n\nAs you ascend the slope you\
      \ will encounter a SkaarjTrooper with a Dispersion Pistol. Make sure it is suitably\
      \ disposed of. Near the top of the canyon (which in itself reveals nothing of\
      \ great value) you will spot another Titan. While you are still at a distance\
      \ and the Titan hasn't spotted you, load up six rockets and fire them in a tight\
      \ circle to get first strike. Then, do the usual job of dodging boulders and\
      \ backing off until the Titan is dead.\n\nWhen you have finished the Titan off,\
      \ go up to the top of the canyon (there's another Nali Healing Fruit to the\
      \ left of a rock near the top). Once the canyon opens out you will realize that\
      \ you are back near the strange structure you saw earlier. The other canyon\
      \ you came up leads down to the right.\n\nYou're ready to proceed. Approach\
      \ the structure and go to the right of a rock at the very top to surprise a\
      \ crouching SkaarjOfficer carrying an ASMD. Kill him and collect the ASMD he\
      \ drops. If you need any health, go to the far right of the structure and collect\
      \ the Nali Healing Fruit in the corner. Then, go round to the front of the structure\
      \ and go through the doorway there into a small forecourt. There's another Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit on the left in the forecourt. Approach the door to the structure\
      \ which has inscriptions either side that read [3].\n\nThe doors open as you\
      \ approach. Step through. Within the structure, go through another set of doors\
      \ ahead to exit the level.\n\n== Translator messages ==\n# \"LOG: R. Ovrevik:\
