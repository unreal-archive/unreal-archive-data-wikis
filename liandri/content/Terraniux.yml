      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Now within the depths of the Terraniux research installation,\
      \ you must continue your search for a way off this planet you've landed on.\
      \ It's not going to be easy - the Mercenaries are tough - but you hardly have\
      \ much of a choice.\n</p><p>You start in the same room with the panel and the\
      \ button (which has now been activated), but the message on the panel has changed\
      \ [1].\n</p><p>Go back through the door so that you return to the area with\
      \ the polished floor. You will see that the biowaste has been pumped out.\n\
      </p><p>Follow the curved walkway back round to the central area where you have\
      \ a view of the control room force field. From here, drop down into the empty\
      \ storage tank and follow it through under the control room so that you approach\
      \ some large doors that were previously locked and under the biowaste. The doors\
      \ open as you approach, so go through; you will be in a large empty biowaste\
      \ storage ring beneath a walkway above. As you enter a <a href=\"/Slith\" title=\"\
      Slith\">Slith</a> comes down from the left, so kill it.\n</p><p>Including the\
      \ now sealed pipe you came in through, there are four exits from this storage\
      \ ring. The only open one is 90° anticlockwise from here, but if you go the\
      \ long way round, clockwise, you can grab an extra Health Pack. Either way,\
      \ go round to the open pipe. There is a Slith lurking here, so blow it up, then\
      \ take the nearby <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\">Flashlight</a>\
      \ and go through the open pipe.\n</p><p>You will be in the bottom of another\
      \ empty storage tank. The walls here are grey not green - this tank has been\
      \ empty for a while. In fact, you will see that this storage tank is damaged,\
      \ with bits of debris around the place. Explore the floor of this tank, looking\
      \ behind the debris and metal barrels to find two ASMD Cores, a Health Pack\
      \ and a cluster of 40 Tarydium Shards. Then, step on to the raised section of\
      \ floor; this is a lift to the walkways above.\n</p><p>As you reach walkway\
      \ level, you will see two Mercenaries crouching in discussion on the central\
      \ walkway. Interrupt their conversation with a big gun, such as the <a href=\"\
      /Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\">Eightball Gun</a> for example.\n\
      </p><p>You are now above the tank in the damaged containment room. Look to the\
      \ back of the room and you will see a red button. Press it and it will glow\
      \ blue. If you climb up on to the ledge above the button via the support struts,\
      \ you can grab a Health Pack and Tarydium Shards.\n</p><p>Now, if you stand\
      \ by the button looking back down to the front of the room, you will see two\
      \ alcoves at the sides of the room. Enter the one on the left to get a <a href=\"\
      /edit/Kevlar_Suit?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Kevlar Suit (page does not\
      \ exist)\">Kevlar Suit</a>, Tarydium Shards and a Health Pack. Now go across\
      \ to the other alcove and you can grab an <a href=\"/Energy_Amplifier\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Energy Amplifier\">Energy Amplifier</a> plus more Tarydium\
      \ Shards. There is a door in this alcove; go through it.\n</p><p>You will now\
      \ be in a tall but short-ish area with a locked door ahead similar to the one\
      \ you came through, biowaste in reservoirs underneath, and a lift beyond a pillar\
      \ with an information panel [2].\n</p><p>Well, this lift is broken and will\
      \ not take you up to the top of the tall shaft beyond the pillar. Step on to\
      \ the LEFT side of the lift though if you want to get some useful gear.\n</p><p>The\
      \ lift will rise about half way then be blocked by a broken pipe that has fallen\
      \ across its path. However, if you use your Flashlight, you will see that from\
      \ this side of the lift you can use the lift clamp as a step to climb up on\
      \ to the broken pipe. If you walk up the broken pipe you will see that you will\
      \ arrive between two vertical pipes with rings round them; step on to the rings\
      \ here and go round the back of the pipes to collect a can of 12 Eightballs\
      \ and a box of 10 very useful Flak Shells. If you fall off (the lift won't come\
      \ back down), don't worry, you can drop down from above later.\n</p><p>Anyway,\
      \ jump back down off the pipes into the biowaste below. Here, once you have\
      \ killed the Slith swimming around in the gunge, you can grab a Health Pack\
      \ before climbing back out at floor level. Return to the damaged containment\
      \ room, and proceed to the front of the room (the far end from the button),\
      \ where you can come out to an information panel at the bottom of a short flight\
      \ of steps to a walkway. Read the panel [3].\n</p><p>Climb the steps out on\
      \ to the main containment ring walkway. Horizontal beams here yield a Health\
      \ Pack and a can of 12 Eightballs. This walkway goes round in a circle directly\
      \ above the empty containment ring below; go a short way anticlockwise to kill\
      \ the Mercenary on guard here. But don't go any further anticlockwise yet, go\
      \ instead clockwise until you reach a locked door on the left and read the legend\
      \ [4]. This is the door to the Control Room.\n</p><p>Horizontal beams here also\
      \ yield a Health Pack which you can collect if you need it. When you're done,\
      \ go through the opening opposite the locked door. You will be in a hub room\
      \ with waterfalls of biowaste pumping out into a vat below; collect Tarydium\
      \ Shards and a Health Pack from on top of the walkway here.\n</p><p>If you jump\
      \ into the vat of biowaste and kill the Slith within, you can get a Health Pack\
      \ from the bottom of the pool. Surface out onto a small platform here and collect\
      \ another Health Pack and also a <a href=\"/Toxin_Suit\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Toxin Suit\">Toxin Suit</a> (if you want to - bear in mind that it\
      \ will replace your Kevlar Suit), then ride the lift back up to the main walkway\
      \ again.\n</p><p>This room has four exits. Get your bearings by finding the\
      \ opening by which you entered this room, which has no door, then go through\
      \ the door opposite this entrance.\n</p><p>You will now be by the entrance to\
      \ Section B, 90° anticlockwise from Section C by which you initially entered\
      \ this area. Collect the two Flak Shells and two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards\
      \ from the horizontal beams here, then go down the steps to Section B's information\
      \ panel [5].\n</p><p>Enter Section B and kill the Mercenary that comes running\
      \ down the central walkway. Looking into the storage tank, you will see that\
      \ it is about half full.\n</p><p>You don't have to go into the biowaste here,\
      \ but if you do you can liberate a Health Pack from the pair of Slith swimming\
      \ around in there. Take the lift out of the biowaste then go and press the red\
      \ button at the back of the room. Once again, it will go blue. You can also\
      \ collect a Health Pack from near the button if you need it. If you go up on\
      \ to the ledge of the button you will find two <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\"\
      >Flares</a>. Then, do what you did in Section C; stand by the button and look\
      \ into the two alcoves.\n</p><p>The one on the left contains a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a>, a fairly pointless\
      \ <a href=\"/Jump_Boots\" title=\"Jump Boots\">Jump Boots</a> inventory item,\
      \ and a door back to Lift 2 which is now unlocked. The other alcove contains\
      \ a Mercenary - watch out. It also contains two cans of 12 Eightballs and 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards. Go through the door in this alcove, and you will arrive at\
      \ an area with an ASMD Core and the infamous Lift 1. Read the information panel\
      \ here [6]. Lift 1 is clearly not operable yet.\n</p><p>Once again, the biowaste\
      \ contains a Slith and a Health Pack. Deal with that then return to Section\
      \ B. Leave Section B and follow the hub ring anticlockwise to Section A, where\
      \ you can get an ASMD Core and a Health Pack from the horizontal beams before\
      \ entering.\n</p><p>Now, descend the steps and look at Section A's information\
      \ panel [7].\n</p><p>Enter Section A and kill the two particularly tough Mercenaries\
      \ here. You can raid the biowaste to find two Slith and a Health Pack. When\
      \ you're done, go and press the red button in this section.\nCollect the box\
      \ of 50 Bullets from by the button, then Tarydium Shards and a very useful <a\
      \ href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\"\
      >Super Health Pack</a> from atop the ledge. Plunder the alcoves, starting with\
      \ the one on the right-hand one for a box of 10 Flak Shells, then go to the\
      \ left-hand alcove to get two ASMD Cores and use the door here to return to\
      \ Lift 1. Provided that you have pressed all 3 buttons in the containment rooms,\
      \ the panel has changed to report that Lift 1 is now operational [8].\n</p><p>Step\
      \ on the lift and ride it up; prepare for the athletic Mercenary who drops down\
      \ from above as you near the top. From the top of the lift, make a right to\
      \ enter the first of the hydroponic greenhouses, where there is a panel with\
      \ a message [9].\n</p><p>Now, enter the greenhouse. Explore the plant beds to\
      \ collect two <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit</a>, then kill the Mercenary who lurks in the corridor behind\
      \ the far side of the greenhouse. Return to the area near the information panel,\
      \ then enter the corridor here. At this point a small lift goes up to an entrance\
      \ to an inner room; ignore it and instead take the passageway that goes round\
      \ the back of Lift 1.\n</p><p>When you are behind Lift 1, look down the shaft\
      \ between the pipes. By dropping down onto the rings here you can get a box\
      \ of 50 Bullets and another Super Health Pack; you probably don't want to get\
      \ them yet but remember about them and come back later if you need them.\n</p><p>Now,\
      \ continue round and into the second greenhouse. A panel on this side of the\
      \ greenhouse has another message [10].\n</p><p>Venture into the greenhouse.\
      \ Kill the Mercenary who is busy here then raid the plant beds for more Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit; you can also collect Tarydium Shards from beside the large\
      \ pillar at the far end of the greenhouse. Return now to the inner end and go\
      \ to the panel on the far side of the greenhouse [11].\n</p><p>Once again, enter\
      \ the corridors within and ingore the small lifts to the interior (though you\
      \ may want to kill the Mercenary within). Take the next corridor, which goes\
      \ round behind Lift 2 (now's your chance to get that ammo if you missed it earlier),\
      \ then go round into the next greenhouse.\n</p><p>This final greenhouse has\
      \ another panel [12].\n</p><p>Once again, enter the greenhouse and kill the\
      \ Mercenary on guard. Two more Nali Healing Fruit can be found in the plant\
      \ beds. Then, go to the far side of the greenhouse from the information panel.\
      \ There is a short slope at the top of which is a metal door / lift controlled\
      \ by a red button nearby. Don't press the button yet, instead now going to the\
      \ small lifts into the inner area. Collect the box of 50 Bullets and Health\
      \ Pack here then ride the lift into the antechamber above. Partake of the two\
      \ clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards in this antechamber, then go through the large\
      \ door into the inner room and kill any Mercenaries that attack beyond.\n</p><p>You\
      \ will be on a crossroads of walkways with an Assault Vest in the middle. Collect\
      \ the armour then look around; three exits lead into the greenhouses whilst\
      \ a fourth is locked with an informative legend [13].\n</p><p>Drop on to the\
      \ floor beneath the walkways then collect what you need of the Health Pack,\
      \ Flare, box of 50 Bullets and can of 12 Eightballs here. Then, stand on one\
      \ of the floor plates with the pink symbol on it. These plates are lifts which\
      \ will take you up to another floor above.\n</p><p>As you reach the top, a Mercenary\
      \ will attack you. Kill him then collect the Tarydim Shards he drops. Then,\
      \ explore this floor to obtain various items; firstly, collect the <a href=\"\
      /Dispersion_Pistol_Powerup\" title=\"Dispersion Pistol Powerup\">Dispersion\
      \ Pistol Powerup</a> in the centre. Then, visit the small ofshoot chambers in\
      \ turn.\n</p><p>One chamber contains two Flak Shells, a box of 50 Bullets and\
      \ a Nali Healing Fruit. Clockwise, the next is empty. The third alcove has an\
      \ ASMD Core, a Flak Shell, a Flashlight and yet another Nali Healing Fruit.\
      \ The fourth alcove has an ASMD Core and a Nali Healing Fruit plus a Kevlar\
      \ Suit.\nAs you collect the Kevlar Suit, a door opens ahead on to a balcony\
      \ overlooking Greenhouse B. You can drop from here on to either one of two pipes,\
      \ one of which contains a Health Pack and the other a box of 10 Flak Shells.\
      \ I tend to go for the Flak Shells as there is so much health around; you can\
      \ always come back up if you need both.\n</p><p>Drop down to the greenhouse\
      \ floor and find your way back round to Greenhouse C, and that button you didn't\
      \ press. Press it now, and the metal door comes down as a lift, allowing you\
      \ access to the room above with a biowaste pool and a Mercenary to kill.\n</p><p>Kill\
      \ the Mercenary then go round the far side to collect a Force Field inventory\
      \ item. There's another locked door here, with the same legend as the last one\
      \ [14].\n</p><p>Somehow you have to get into the control room... but you're\
      \ out of routes to take. Well, there's only one way left to go, so plunge into\
      \ the biowaste.\n</p><p>Swim down to the bottom. You are in a pipe with an exit\
      \ of either side and a tunnel at one end; take the end tunnel to surface in\
      \ a short closed pipe where there are two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge (<a href=\"\
      /Bio_Rifle\" title=\"Bio Rifle\">GES Biorifle</a> ammo). Then, return to the\
      \ main pipe and look at the exits. The one on the left is a quicker way but\
      \ the one on the right takes you to some extra goodies, so take the one on the\
      \ right. Two small doors later, you will be in an open-topped stretch of pipe.\
      \ Take this opportunity to surface for air.\n</p><p>You will be in a small area\
      \ of piping beneath some walkways above. If you pipe-hop to the far end of this\
      \ area, you can collect two cans of 12 Eightballs. As you traverse the pipes\
      \ here, also look out for a Mercenary on the walkways above that you can kill.\n\
      </p><p>Now, go back into the biowaste and continue along the pipe. Soon you\
      \ will arrive in another cross-pipe; make a right and surface in another short\
      \ closed pipe in which there is a Health Pack.\nTake the plunge for one more\
      \ time and follow the other exit out of the cross-pipe; shortly you'll surface\
      \ in a very dark tunnel, so activate your Flashlight to light the way round\
      \ its twists and turns.\n</p><p>Some winding later and - at last! You emerge\
      \ inside the much-sought Control Room.\n</p><p>Kill the two Mercenaries on guard\
      \ here... there's a GES Biorifle by the force field, so collect it first, then\
      \ press the two red buttons on either side of the control room [15,16].\n</p><p>Now,\
      \ before you leave, look into the mouths of the pipes entering this room. In\
      \ one corner by some metal crates a pipe mouth contains a box of 50 Bullets;\
      \ use the smaller crate as a step and jump in to get 'em. Then, push the smaller\
      \ crate over to the far corner and use it to jump into the pipe in that corner\
      \ where there's a handy Super Health Pack.\n</p><p>When you're done, go through\
      \ the Control Room doors back on to the main containment ring and find your\
      \ way back to Lift 1 through Section A or Section B. Watch out, because another\
      \ Mercenary and another Slith have appeared in the Lift 1 area.\n</p><p>Once\
      \ back in hydroponics, return to Greenhouse C and go back up the lift operated\
      \ by the red button. In the room with the biowaste pool, the previously locked\
      \ door is now unlocked with a new legend [17].\n</p><p>Go through the door and\
      \ you will be on the walkways with the open piping below where you swam earlier.\
      \ Collect the two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge here, then head for the opening\
      \ in the wall on the left. Inside there is a lift; this is the lift to Noork's\
      \ Elbow mentioned earlier.\nRide the lift down and walk towards the door at\
      \ the bottom to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

    text: "[[Image:Terraniux.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]\n'''Terraniux''' is the eleventh\
      \ map in [[Unreal|Unreal's]] single player game.\n; Author : [[Inoxx]]\n; Description\n\
      : The player enters the heart of the labyrinthine Terraniux facility. As dusk\
      \ begins to fall outside, the player searches for a way to gain access to the\
      \ hydroponic greenhouses, from which he might be able to find a way to escape\
      \ the heavily defended [[Mercenary]] facility and reach the elusive place known\
      \ as [[Noork's Elbow]].\n{{clear}}\n==Weapons and Items==\nNew\n* [[Jump Boots]]\n\

      * [[Nali bird]]\n\n\n\n==Walkthrough==\nNow within the depths of the Terraniux\
      \ research installation, you must continue your search for a way off this planet\
      \ you've landed on. It's not going to be easy - the Mercenaries are tough -\
      \ but you hardly have much of a choice.\n\nYou start in the same room with the\
      \ panel and the button (which has now been activated), but the message on the\
      \ panel has changed [1].\n\nGo back through the door so that you return to the\
      \ area with the polished floor. You will see that the biowaste has been pumped\
      \ out.\n\nFollow the curved walkway back round to the central area where you\
      \ have a view of the control room force field. From here, drop down into the\
      \ empty storage tank and follow it through under the control room so that you\
      \ approach some large doors that were previously locked and under the biowaste.\
      \ The doors open as you approach, so go through; you will be in a large empty\
      \ biowaste storage ring beneath a walkway above. As you enter a [[Slith]] comes\
      \ down from the left, so kill it.\n\nIncluding the now sealed pipe you came\
      \ in through, there are four exits from this storage ring. The only open one\
      \ is 90° anticlockwise from here, but if you go the long way round, clockwise,\
      \ you can grab an extra Health Pack. Either way, go round to the open pipe.\
      \ There is a Slith lurking here, so blow it up, then take the nearby [[Flashlight]]\
      \ and go through the open pipe.\n\nYou will be in the bottom of another empty\
      \ storage tank. The walls here are grey not green - this tank has been empty\
      \ for a while. In fact, you will see that this storage tank is damaged, with\
      \ bits of debris around the place. Explore the floor of this tank, looking behind\
      \ the debris and metal barrels to find two ASMD Cores, a Health Pack and a cluster\
      \ of 40 Tarydium Shards. Then, step on to the raised section of floor; this\
      \ is a lift to the walkways above.\n\nAs you reach walkway level, you will see\
      \ two Mercenaries crouching in discussion on the central walkway. Interrupt\
      \ their conversation with a big gun, such as the [[Rocket Launcher|Eightball\
      \ Gun]] for example.\n\nYou are now above the tank in the damaged containment\
      \ room. Look to the back of the room and you will see a red button. Press it\
      \ and it will glow blue. If you climb up on to the ledge above the button via\
      \ the support struts, you can grab a Health Pack and Tarydium Shards.\n\nNow,\
      \ if you stand by the button looking back down to the front of the room, you\
      \ will see two alcoves at the sides of the room. Enter the one on the left to\
      \ get a [[Kevlar Suit]], Tarydium Shards and a Health Pack. Now go across to\
      \ the other alcove and you can grab an [[Energy Amplifier]] plus more Tarydium\
      \ Shards. There is a door in this alcove; go through it.\n\nYou will now be\
      \ in a tall but short-ish area with a locked door ahead similar to the one you\
      \ came through, biowaste in reservoirs underneath, and a lift beyond a pillar\
      \ with an information panel [2].\n\nWell, this lift is broken and will not take\
      \ you up to the top of the tall shaft beyond the pillar. Step on to the LEFT\
      \ side of the lift though if you want to get some useful gear.\n\nThe lift will\
      \ rise about half way then be blocked by a broken pipe that has fallen across\
      \ its path. However, if you use your Flashlight, you will see that from this\
      \ side of the lift you can use the lift clamp as a step to climb up on to the\
      \ broken pipe. If you walk up the broken pipe you will see that you will arrive\
      \ between two vertical pipes with rings round them; step on to the rings here\
      \ and go round the back of the pipes to collect a can of 12 Eightballs and a\
      \ box of 10 very useful Flak Shells. If you fall off (the lift won't come back\
      \ down), don't worry, you can drop down from above later.\n\nAnyway, jump back\
      \ down off the pipes into the biowaste below. Here, once you have killed the\
      \ Slith swimming around in the gunge, you can grab a Health Pack before climbing\
      \ back out at floor level. Return to the damaged containment room, and proceed\
      \ to the front of the room (the far end from the button), where you can come\
      \ out to an information panel at the bottom of a short flight of steps to a\
      \ walkway. Read the panel [3].\n\nClimb the steps out on to the main containment\
      \ ring walkway. Horizontal beams here yield a Health Pack and a can of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ This walkway goes round in a circle directly above the empty containment ring\
      \ below; go a short way anticlockwise to kill the Mercenary on guard here. But\
      \ don't go any further anticlockwise yet, go instead clockwise until you reach\
      \ a locked door on the left and read the legend [4]. This is the door to the\
      \ Control Room.\n\nHorizontal beams here also yield a Health Pack which you\
      \ can collect if you need it. When you're done, go through the opening opposite\
      \ the locked door. You will be in a hub room with waterfalls of biowaste pumping\
      \ out into a vat below; collect Tarydium Shards and a Health Pack from on top\
      \ of the walkway here.\n\nIf you jump into the vat of biowaste and kill the\
      \ Slith within, you can get a Health Pack from the bottom of the pool. Surface\
      \ out onto a small platform here and collect another Health Pack and also a\
      \ [[Toxin Suit]] (if you want to - bear in mind that it will replace your Kevlar\
      \ Suit), then ride the lift back up to the main walkway again.\n\nThis room\
      \ has four exits. Get your bearings by finding the opening by which you entered\
      \ this room, which has no door, then go through the door opposite this entrance.\n\
      \nYou will now be by the entrance to Section B, 90° anticlockwise from Section\
      \ C by which you initially entered this area. Collect the two Flak Shells and\
      \ two clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards from the horizontal beams here, then go\
      \ down the steps to Section B's information panel [5].\n\nEnter Section B and\
      \ kill the Mercenary that comes running down the central walkway. Looking into\
      \ the storage tank, you will see that it is about half full.\n\nYou don't have\
      \ to go into the biowaste here, but if you do you can liberate a Health Pack\
      \ from the pair of Slith swimming around in there. Take the lift out of the\
      \ biowaste then go and press the red button at the back of the room. Once again,\
      \ it will go blue. You can also collect a Health Pack from near the button if\
      \ you need it. If you go up on to the ledge of the button you will find two\
      \ [[Flare|Flares]]. Then, do what you did in Section C; stand by the button\
      \ and look into the two alcoves.\n\nThe one on the left contains a [[Shield\
      \ Belt]], a fairly pointless [[Jump Boots]] inventory item, and a door back\
      \ to Lift 2 which is now unlocked. The other alcove contains a Mercenary - watch\
      \ out. It also contains two cans of 12 Eightballs and 40 Tarydium Shards. Go\
      \ through the door in this alcove, and you will arrive at an area with an ASMD\
      \ Core and the infamous Lift 1. Read the information panel here [6]. Lift 1\
      \ is clearly not operable yet.\n\nOnce again, the biowaste contains a Slith\
      \ and a Health Pack. Deal with that then return to Section B. Leave Section\
      \ B and follow the hub ring anticlockwise to Section A, where you can get an\
      \ ASMD Core and a Health Pack from the horizontal beams before entering.\n\n\
      Now, descend the steps and look at Section A's information panel [7].\n\nEnter\
      \ Section A and kill the two particularly tough Mercenaries here. You can raid\
      \ the biowaste to find two Slith and a Health Pack. When you're done, go and\
      \ press the red button in this section.\nCollect the box of 50 Bullets from\
      \ by the button, then Tarydium Shards and a very useful [[Super Health Pack]]\
      \ from atop the ledge. Plunder the alcoves, starting with the one on the right-hand\
      \ one for a box of 10 Flak Shells, then go to the left-hand alcove to get two\
      \ ASMD Cores and use the door here to return to Lift 1. Provided that you have\
      \ pressed all 3 buttons in the containment rooms, the panel has changed to report\
      \ that Lift 1 is now operational [8].\n\nStep on the lift and ride it up; prepare\
      \ for the athletic Mercenary who drops down from above as you near the top.\
      \ From the top of the lift, make a right to enter the first of the hydroponic\
      \ greenhouses, where there is a panel with a message [9].\n\nNow, enter the\
      \ greenhouse. Explore the plant beds to collect two [[Nali Healing Fruit]],\
      \ then kill the Mercenary who lurks in the corridor behind the far side of the\
      \ greenhouse. Return to the area near the information panel, then enter the\
      \ corridor here. At this point a small lift goes up to an entrance to an inner\
      \ room; ignore it and instead take the passageway that goes round the back of\
      \ Lift 1.\n\nWhen you are behind Lift 1, look down the shaft between the pipes.\
      \ By dropping down onto the rings here you can get a box of 50 Bullets and another\
      \ Super Health Pack; you probably don't want to get them yet but remember about\
      \ them and come back later if you need them.\n\nNow, continue round and into\
      \ the second greenhouse. A panel on this side of the greenhouse has another\
      \ message [10].\n\nVenture into the greenhouse. Kill the Mercenary who is busy\
      \ here then raid the plant beds for more Nali Healing Fruit; you can also collect\
      \ Tarydium Shards from beside the large pillar at the far end of the greenhouse.\
      \ Return now to the inner end and go to the panel on the far side of the greenhouse\
      \ [11].\n\nOnce again, enter the corridors within and ingore the small lifts\
      \ to the interior (though you may want to kill the Mercenary within). Take the\
      \ next corridor, which goes round behind Lift 2 (now's your chance to get that\
      \ ammo if you missed it earlier), then go round into the next greenhouse.\n\n\
      This final greenhouse has another panel [12].\n\nOnce again, enter the greenhouse\
      \ and kill the Mercenary on guard. Two more Nali Healing Fruit can be found\
      \ in the plant beds. Then, go to the far side of the greenhouse from the information\
      \ panel. There is a short slope at the top of which is a metal door / lift controlled\
      \ by a red button nearby. Don't press the button yet, instead now going to the\
      \ small lifts into the inner area. Collect the box of 50 Bullets and Health\
      \ Pack here then ride the lift into the antechamber above. Partake of the two\
      \ clusters of 40 Tarydium Shards in this antechamber, then go through the large\
      \ door into the inner room and kill any Mercenaries that attack beyond.\n\n\
      You will be on a crossroads of walkways with an Assault Vest in the middle.\
      \ Collect the armour then look around; three exits lead into the greenhouses\
      \ whilst a fourth is locked with an informative legend [13].\n\nDrop on to the\
      \ floor beneath the walkways then collect what you need of the Health Pack,\
      \ Flare, box of 50 Bullets and can of 12 Eightballs here. Then, stand on one\
      \ of the floor plates with the pink symbol on it. These plates are lifts which\
      \ will take you up to another floor above.\n\nAs you reach the top, a Mercenary\
      \ will attack you. Kill him then collect the Tarydim Shards he drops. Then,\
      \ explore this floor to obtain various items; firstly, collect the [[Dispersion\
      \ Pistol Powerup]] in the centre. Then, visit the small ofshoot chambers in\
      \ turn.\n\nOne chamber contains two Flak Shells, a box of 50 Bullets and a Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit. Clockwise, the next is empty. The third alcove has an ASMD\
      \ Core, a Flak Shell, a Flashlight and yet another Nali Healing Fruit. The fourth\
      \ alcove has an ASMD Core and a Nali Healing Fruit plus a Kevlar Suit.\nAs you\
      \ collect the Kevlar Suit, a door opens ahead on to a balcony overlooking Greenhouse\
      \ B. You can drop from here on to either one of two pipes, one of which contains\
      \ a Health Pack and the other a box of 10 Flak Shells. I tend to go for the\
      \ Flak Shells as there is so much health around; you can always come back up\
      \ if you need both.\n\nDrop down to the greenhouse floor and find your way back\
      \ round to Greenhouse C, and that button you didn't press. Press it now, and\
      \ the metal door comes down as a lift, allowing you access to the room above\
      \ with a biowaste pool and a Mercenary to kill.\n\nKill the Mercenary then go\
      \ round the far side to collect a Force Field inventory item. There's another\
      \ locked door here, with the same legend as the last one [14].\n\nSomehow you\
      \ have to get into the control room... but you're out of routes to take. Well,\
      \ there's only one way left to go, so plunge into the biowaste.\n\nSwim down\
      \ to the bottom. You are in a pipe with an exit of either side and a tunnel\
      \ at one end; take the end tunnel to surface in a short closed pipe where there\
      \ are two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge ([[Bio Rifle|GES Biorifle]] ammo). Then,\
      \ return to the main pipe and look at the exits. The one on the left is a quicker\
      \ way but the one on the right takes you to some extra goodies, so take the\
      \ one on the right. Two small doors later, you will be in an open-topped stretch\
      \ of pipe. Take this opportunity to surface for air.\n\nYou will be in a small\
      \ area of piping beneath some walkways above. If you pipe-hop to the far end\
      \ of this area, you can collect two cans of 12 Eightballs. As you traverse the\
      \ pipes here, also look out for a Mercenary on the walkways above that you can\
      \ kill.\n\nNow, go back into the biowaste and continue along the pipe. Soon\
      \ you will arrive in another cross-pipe; make a right and surface in another\
      \ short closed pipe in which there is a Health Pack.\nTake the plunge for one\
      \ more time and follow the other exit out of the cross-pipe; shortly you'll\
      \ surface in a very dark tunnel, so activate your Flashlight to light the way\
      \ round its twists and turns.\n\nSome winding later and - at last! You emerge\
      \ inside the much-sought Control Room.\n\nKill the two Mercenaries on guard\
      \ here... there's a GES Biorifle by the force field, so collect it first, then\
      \ press the two red buttons on either side of the control room [15,16].\n\n\
      Now, before you leave, look into the mouths of the pipes entering this room.\
      \ In one corner by some metal crates a pipe mouth contains a box of 50 Bullets;\
      \ use the smaller crate as a step and jump in to get 'em. Then, push the smaller\
      \ crate over to the far corner and use it to jump into the pipe in that corner\
      \ where there's a handy Super Health Pack.\n\nWhen you're done, go through the\
      \ Control Room doors back on to the main containment ring and find your way\
      \ back to Lift 1 through Section A or Section B. Watch out, because another\
      \ Mercenary and another Slith have appeared in the Lift 1 area.\n\nOnce back\
      \ in hydroponics, return to Greenhouse C and go back up the lift operated by\
      \ the red button. In the room with the biowaste pool, the previously locked\
      \ door is now unlocked with a new legend [17].\n\nGo through the door and you\
      \ will be on the walkways with the open piping below where you swam earlier.\
      \ Collect the two 25kg cans of Tarydium Sludge here, then head for the opening\
      \ in the wall on the left. Inside there is a lift; this is the lift to Noork's\
      \ Elbow mentioned earlier.\nRide the lift down and walk towards the door at\
      \ the bottom to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"Pump activated,\
