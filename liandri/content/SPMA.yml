      \ variety of uses and accommodates many different tactics. In the hands of a\
      \ good player, a SPMA can serve to either press a pre-emptive strike, or it\
      \ can stave off an attacking force, all from a safe, indirect distance. In a\
      \ pinch, the SPMA can also substitute for the Hellbender, and its skymine turret\
      \ is just as effective as the Hellbender's, able to devastate infantry as well\
      \ as quickly take out a node.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tactics\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Offense\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Offense is a bit of a balancing act: You can send\
      \ the camera up high and be very hard to spot. (Especially on maps like <a href=\"\
      /ONS-IslandHop\" title=\"ONS-IslandHop\">ONS-IslandHop</a>) However, your shell\
      \ will fragment widely, which is fine if that's what the situation calls for.\
      \ Conversely, a lower trajectory will allow you to much more greatly focus the\
      \ shot, devastating more of a focused area; however, this also makes it easier\
      \ to \"trace the shell\" and get a trajectory back to you, and you can be pretty\
      \ sure if it's traced back, you'll be dealing with people in short order. Always\
      \ keep an eye on your armor if you're bombarding - if it starts going down,\
      \ you're getting shot at, and nothing's more annoying than to be focusing on\
      \ bombing and you're suddenly dead.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Defending against\
      \ the SPMA is generally not too hard. The hardest part will usually be actually\
      \ <i>finding</i> the SPMA in the first place. If you find the camera, shoot\
      \ it and attempt to watch as much of the surrounding area as possible, to see\
      \ if you can find the next shell/camera as it's getting shot out. The shot always\
      \ fires in a straight direction, in a parabolic arc, so if you see the shell\
      \ flying for any appreciable length of time (at least half a second or so) you\
      \ can generally figure out where the SPMA is. This is called \"tracing the shell\"\
      \ or \"shell tracing.\" Its strengths as a support vehicle means that other\
      \ than that, it needs to be up close to do significant damage. (Note that, however,\
      \ like the Hellbender, the Skymine Turret Detonator can be used like a slightly\
      \ faster rate of fire shock rifle, although it does less damage.)\n</p><p>Vehicles\
      \ that are excellent at taking out the SPMA are <a href=\"/Raptor\" title=\"\
      Raptor\">Raptors</a> and <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"Manta\">Mantas</a>, as it\
      \ only has 600 armor, and will take it out relatively quickly, although the\
      \ rapid, small amounts of damage risk tipping off the bombardier. If it's unmanned\
      \ by a passenger, than you can even safely get reasonably close on foot and\
      \ destroy it. (Flak and 3-Pack Rockets are excellent for this.) Be wary, however,\
      \ some drivers will notice the damage and promptly switch to the second seat,\
      \ so don't sit in a position where you can be easily skymined. Other equally\
      \ good alternatives are the <a href=\"/Cicada\" title=\"Cicada\">Cicada</a>\
      \ (its rocket-queuing altfire mode will devastate and usually make quick work\
      \ of a SPMA) or a <a href=\"/Goliath\" title=\"Goliath\">Goliath</a>. (Two shots\
      \ and it's dead no matter what.)\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ or <a href=\"/Viper\" title=\"Viper\">Viper</a>, at close to medium range.\

      \ If you don't move, the SPMA driver might actually try to pick you off with\

      \ usage of the main gun by firing even the camera shell into walls or the ground\
      \ next to an attacker and often enough even succeed.\n</p><p>From afar you can\
      \ annoy the SPMA driver by making sure his camera won't stay up there very long.\
      \ Take down any enemy camera shell you see. Even a single hit with an <a href=\"\

    text: "The '''Self-Propelled Mobile Artillery''' or '''SPMA''' (often pronounced\
      \ \"Spamma\" as opposed to the individual letters) is a wheeled long range artillery\
      \ vehicle, first seen in [[Unreal Tournament 2004]] with the Editor's Choice\
      \ Bonus Pack. The name's similarity to the word \"[[spam]]\" is probably intended.\n\
      __TOC__\n== Unreal Tournament 2004 ==\n{{Infobox Vehicle\n| name        = SPMA\n\
      | image       = [[Image:UT2004 SPMA.png|200px]]\n| health      = 600\n| numseats\
      \    = 2\n| drivabil    = Mortar shell\n| 1passabil   = Skymine shock turret\n\
      | mainuses    = Support, Suppressive Fire\n}}\n=== Features ===\n==== Pilot\
      \ ====\nApart from driving the vehicle, the driver has access to the mortar\
      \ shell cannon. Primary fire sends a single shell in the given angle. Alternate\
      \ fire follows the shell, which can be deployed as a camera by pressing alternate\
      \ fire again. Next, a target can be chosen by using the movement keys/buttons.\
      \ Pressing primary fire again will then send a set of five shells into the given\
      \ area.\n\n==== Gunner ====\nThe passenger controls a skymine turret akin to\
      \ that of the [[Hellbender]].\n\n=== Uses ===\nThe SPMA is a powerful vehicle,\
      \ capable of a wide variety of uses and accommodates many different tactics.\
      \ In the hands of a good player, a SPMA can serve to either press a pre-emptive\
      \ strike, or it can stave off an attacking force, all from a safe, indirect\
      \ distance. In a pinch, the SPMA can also substitute for the Hellbender, and\
      \ its skymine turret is just as effective as the Hellbender's, able to devastate\
      \ infantry as well as quickly take out a node.\n\n=== Tactics ===\n==== Offense\
      \ ====\nOffense is a bit of a balancing act: You can send the camera up high\
      \ and be very hard to spot. (Especially on maps like [[ONS-IslandHop]]) However,\
      \ your shell will fragment widely, which is fine if that's what the situation\
      \ calls for. Conversely, a lower trajectory will allow you to much more greatly\
      \ focus the shot, devastating more of a focused area; however, this also makes\
      \ it easier to \"trace the shell\" and get a trajectory back to you, and you\
      \ can be pretty sure if it's traced back, you'll be dealing with people in short\
      \ order. Always keep an eye on your armor if you're bombarding - if it starts\
      \ going down, you're getting shot at, and nothing's more annoying than to be\
      \ focusing on bombing and you're suddenly dead.\n\n==== Defense ====\nDefending\
      \ against the SPMA is generally not too hard. The hardest part will usually\
      \ be actually ''finding'' the SPMA in the first place. If you find the camera,\
      \ shoot it and attempt to watch as much of the surrounding area as possible,\
      \ to see if you can find the next shell/camera as it's getting shot out. The\
      \ shot always fires in a straight direction, in a parabolic arc, so if you see\
      \ the shell flying for any appreciable length of time (at least half a second\
      \ or so) you can generally figure out where the SPMA is. This is called \"tracing\
      \ the shell\" or \"shell tracing.\" Its strengths as a support vehicle means\
      \ that other than that, it needs to be up close to do significant damage. (Note\
      \ that, however, like the Hellbender, the Skymine Turret Detonator can be used\
      \ like a slightly faster rate of fire shock rifle, although it does less damage.)\n\
      \nVehicles that are excellent at taking out the SPMA are [[Raptor]]s and [[Manta]]s,\
      \ as it only has 600 armor, and will take it out relatively quickly, although\
      \ the rapid, small amounts of damage risk tipping off the bombardier. If it's\
      \ unmanned by a passenger, than you can even safely get reasonably close on\
      \ foot and destroy it. (Flak and 3-Pack Rockets are excellent for this.) Be\
      \ wary, however, some drivers will notice the damage and promptly switch to\
      \ the second seat, so don't sit in a position where you can be easily skymined.\
      \ Other equally good alternatives are the [[Cicada]] (its rocket-queuing altfire\
      \ mode will devastate and usually make quick work of a SPMA) or a [[Goliath]].\
      \ (Two shots and it's dead no matter what.)\n\n== Unreal Tournament 3 ==\n{{Infobox\

      <p>This self propelled mobile artillery (SPMA) device is infamous for its ability\
      \ to blanket a large area with the devastating fire that falls from the sky\
      \ above. </p>\n<p>The [[Axon]] Hellfire is sufficiently maneuverable to deploy\
      \ its long range artillery cannon on almost any terrain. A remote camera gives\
      \ its operator a bird's-eye view of the battlefield through a targeting reticule\
      \ that calculates the projected area of impact in real time. </p>\n<p>The vehicle\
      \ housing also incorporates a defensive shock cannon that deploys floating mines\
      \ of unstable plasma which can be chain-ignited by the weapon's secondary fire\
      \ photon beam.</p>|[[UT3]] manual}}\n\n=== Using the SPMA ===\nIn [[UT3]] the\
      \ SPMA needs to deploy to use its main turret and undeploy to use the skymine\
      \ turret. Keep this in mind when looking for a place to attack from. The skymine\
      \ turret is useful for defending against enemy players on foot or in open vehicles,\
      \ like [[Manta]] or [[Viper]], at close to medium range. When deployed, the\
      \ main turret first fires a camera shell that, once it's under way, can be activated\
      \ by pressing any of the fire buttons. Make sure you find a good place for the\
      \ camera because placing a new camera is time-consuming. Keep in mind, that\
      \ the camera can be taken down with a single hit. Also keep in mind that the\
      \ camera shell is just as explosive as regular shells.\n\nYou should consider\
      \ entering the SPMA only after picking up the [[AVRiL]], so you can quickly\
      \ get out and defend against flying vehicles.\n\n=== Going against the SPMA\
      \ ===\nThe best way to fight the SPMA is from high above it because that's one\
      \ of the few places it can't reach directly. Any air vehicle should be fine\
      \ as long as you either hover right above the SPMA or keep moving. If you don't\
      \ move, the SPMA driver might actually try to pick you off with the main gun\
      \ - shame on you if he succeeds! It's even more embarrassing to crash into a\
      \ deployed SPMA camera shell, so watch where you're going.\n\nIf you don't happen\
      \ to have a flying vehicle, a [[Manta]], [[Scorpion]] or even the [[Link Gun]]\
      \ are effective against a deployed Hellfire. Just make sure you catch the driver\
      \ by surprise or attack from a place he can't reach. Some SPMA drivers resort\
      \ to pretty desperate usage of the main gun by firing even the camera shell\
      \ into walls or the ground next to an attacker and often enough even succeed.\n\
      \nFrom afar you can annoy the SPMA driver by making sure his camera won't stay\
      \ up there very long. Take down any enemy camera shell you see. Even a single\
      \ hit with an [[Enforcer]] is enough, but any precise weapons like Link Gun\
      \ primary, [[Shock Rifle]] primary or the [[Sniper Rifle]] are effective with\
      \ single shots. If the camera didn't fall down on the first hit, stop shooting\
      \ - it's on your own team!\n\n{{Vehicles}}"
