      <p>The Fallen City is a very descriptive name for this map. It features large\
      \ abandoned buildings and roads filled with rubbish. Inside this city lies an\
      \ underground bunker which the attacking team must destroy. The dropship where\
      \ the team starts landed a few blocks away, so the team must first battle their\
      \ way through the streets before taking out the rebel base.\n</p><p>This could\
      \ be considered an updated and reimagined <a href=\"/AS-Mazon\" title=\"AS-Mazon\"\

      >edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dt>Destroy\
      \ the Barricade</dt>\n<dd> The first objective requires the attackers to blow\
      \ up a barricade that's blocking the way. This can be reached by moving up the\
      \ stair and going through a small tunnel on the left of the street. It's also\
      \ possible to walk around all the scrap, but that will take longer plus it's\
      \ more exposed. About 17 rockets should be enough to destroy the barricade</dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The defending team has <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\" title=\"Sniper Rifle\"\
      >Sniper Rifles</a> and a <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\" title=\"\
      Turrets\">Minigun Turret</a> on a higher ground, which overlooks the road to\
      \ the attacker's spawnpoints. Attackers can avoid most of these by staying behind\
      \ the large piles of junk. Defenders can also pick up a nearby <a href=\"/Armor#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Armor\">Shield Pack</a> and use their <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"\
      Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a> to ambush the attackers near the tunnel. There's\
      \ also another Minigun Turret above the barricade that can help in stalling\
      \ the attackers. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Secure Forward Outpost</dt>\n<dd> The road\
      \ is now clear and the forward outpost is nearby. Just after the barricade the\
      \ road turns right. The forward outpost can be seen on the left side. Completing\
      \ this objective will give the attackers a new weapon loadout. </dd></dl>\n\
      <dl><dd> The defending team can use a slightly shorter route then the attackers,\
      \ but only if they spawned at the Minigun Turret above the barricade. The other\
      \ defenders will have to take the same route as the attackers to try to keep\
      \ up. There's another Minigun Turret overlooking the other side of the barricade,\
      \ but, just like the first one, this one can be avoided by the attackers if\
      \ they walk around the pieces of scrap. </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy Gate Lock</dt>\n\
      <dd> After securing the outpost, a big explosions will clear the way to the\
      \ bunker. There are 2 roads that lead to the bunker: the metal plates leads\
      \ to a set of train tracks. This road will take the attackers past most of the\
      \ defenders on the ground. The downside, however, is that an enemy Minigun Turret\
      \ on the opposite end has a clear view on the entire track.</dd>\n<dd>The other\
      \ road (which is on the ground-level) is more secluded. The Minigun Turret's\
      \ fire can be avoided most of the times, but this is the road the defending\
      \ team will be guarding the most. The Gate Locks are fairly weak, but they are\
      \ slightly difficult to reach, as they're behind the front walls of the bunker.\
      \ A Gate Lock needs 7 rockets to be destroyed.  </dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> After the\
      \ forward outpost has been secured, <a href=\"/Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004\"\
      \ title=\"Turrets\">Sentinels</a> will spawn in the area, which will kill the\
      \ defenders. Since they respawn at the bunker, the defending team should have\
      \ enough time to prepare. The Minigun Turret will hold off anyone who takes\
      \ the tracks. Sniper rifles can be used to frag the attackers from a distance.\
      \ The Shield Pack and <a href=\"/Rocket_Launcher\" title=\"Rocket Launcher\"\
      >Rocket Launcher</a> will give the defenders a good chance in close combat.\
      \ </dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Destroy Command Center</dt>\n<dd> After the doors have\
      \ been opened the attackers can move to the final objective. Another (automatically\
      \ opening) door inside the base could stall the attackers a bit, but it shouldn't\
      \ take them long to reach the final part. There the attackers have to plant\
      \ explosives on 2 targets: A column on the platform and a crate inside the train.\
      \ There is an opening in the back of the train that provides a 2nd path between\
      \ both targets, but it's not much shorter. After the explosives have been placed\
      \ the countdown begins, followed by a cutscene.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dd> The defending\
      \ team will be waiting for the attackers near the train. The <a href=\"/Sniper_Rifle\"\
      \ title=\"Sniper Rifle\">Sniper Rifle</a> and the <a href=\"/Shock_Rifle\" title=\"\
      Shock Rifle\">Shock Rifle</a> are the more interesting weapons in the loadout\
      \ here. Headshots and shock combo's are most effective for fighting off the\
      \ attackers in the descending corridor. A combination of Rocket Launchers and\
      \ explosive barrels will be the best option for fighting off the attackers who've\
      \ made it past the corridor.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ these up will help the attacker take down the Minigun Turret faster. There\

    text: "{{Infobox Map\n| title       = The Fallen City\n| description = Following\
      \ the human/skaarj war, many of Earth's cities lay in ruins.  When the [[New\
      \ Earth Government]] attempted to assert its authority over these areas, they\
      \ were confronted by many rebel groups, often covertly financed by the great\
      \ corporations, which had established bases in the destroyed cities. This scenario\
      \ recreates the destruction of a rebel command center by NEG forces. In keeping\
      \ with the historical battle, the attacker's insertion point is a distance away\
      \ from the command center, because of the heavy anti-aircraft protection around\
      \ the bunker..\n| mapimage    = AS-Fallencity.gif\n| imagedesc   = The Fallen\
      \ City\n| author      = [[Phil Cole]]& [[Rogelio Olguin]]\n| players     = 8-16\n\
      | music       = KR-City\n| game        = UT2004\n| gametype    = Assault\n}}\n\
      \n==Map Description==\nThe Fallen City is a very descriptive name for this map.\
      \ It features large abandoned buildings and roads filled with rubbish. Inside\
      \ this city lies an underground bunker which the attacking team must destroy.\
      \ The dropship where the team starts landed a few blocks away, so the team must\
      \ first battle their way through the streets before taking out the rebel base.\n\
      \nThis could be considered an updated and reimagined [[AS-Mazon]].\n\n==Objectives==\n\
      ;Destroy the Barricade\n: The first objective requires the attackers to blow\
      \ up a barricade that's blocking the way. This can be reached by moving up the\
      \ stair and going through a small tunnel on the left of the street. It's also\
      \ possible to walk around all the scrap, but that will take longer plus it's\
      \ more exposed. About 17 rockets should be enough to destroy the barricade\n\
      \n: The defending team has [[Sniper Rifle|Sniper Rifles]] and a [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Minigun\
      \ Turret]] on a higher ground, which overlooks the road to the attacker's spawnpoints.\
      \ Attackers can avoid most of these by staying behind the large piles of junk.\
      \ Defenders can also pick up a nearby [[Armor#Unreal_Tournament_2003_and_2004|Shield\
      \ Pack]] and use their [[Flak Cannon]] to ambush the attackers near the tunnel.\
      \ There's also another Minigun Turret above the barricade that can help in stalling\
      \ the attackers. \n\n;Secure Forward Outpost\n: The road is now clear and the\
      \ forward outpost is nearby. Just after the barricade the road turns right.\
      \ The forward outpost can be seen on the left side. Completing this objective\
      \ will give the attackers a new weapon loadout. \n\n: The defending team can\
      \ use a slightly shorter route then the attackers, but only if they spawned\
      \ at the Minigun Turret above the barricade. The other defenders will have to\
      \ take the same route as the attackers to try to keep up. There's another Minigun\
      \ Turret overlooking the other side of the barricade, but, just like the first\
      \ one, this one can be avoided by the attackers if they walk around the pieces\
      \ of scrap. \n\n;Destroy Gate Lock\n: After securing the outpost, a big explosions\
      \ will clear the way to the bunker. There are 2 roads that lead to the bunker:\
      \ the metal plates leads to a set of train tracks. This road will take the attackers\
      \ past most of the defenders on the ground. The downside, however, is that an\
      \ enemy Minigun Turret on the opposite end has a clear view on the entire track.\n\
      :The other road (which is on the ground-level) is more secluded. The Minigun\
      \ Turret's fire can be avoided most of the times, but this is the road the defending\
      \ team will be guarding the most. The Gate Locks are fairly weak, but they are\
      \ slightly difficult to reach, as they're behind the front walls of the bunker.\
      \ A Gate Lock needs 7 rockets to be destroyed.  \n\n: After the forward outpost\
      \ has been secured, [[Turrets#Unreal_Tournament_2004|Sentinels]] will spawn\
      \ in the area, which will kill the defenders. Since they respawn at the bunker,\
      \ the defending team should have enough time to prepare. The Minigun Turret\
      \ will hold off anyone who takes the tracks. Sniper rifles can be used to frag\
      \ the attackers from a distance. The Shield Pack and [[Rocket Launcher]] will\
      \ give the defenders a good chance in close combat. \n\n;Destroy Command Center\n\
      : After the doors have been opened the attackers can move to the final objective.\
      \ Another (automatically opening) door inside the base could stall the attackers\
      \ a bit, but it shouldn't take them long to reach the final part. There the\
      \ attackers have to plant explosives on 2 targets: A column on the platform\
      \ and a crate inside the train. There is an opening in the back of the train\
      \ that provides a 2nd path between both targets, but it's not much shorter.\
      \ After the explosives have been placed the countdown begins, followed by a\
      \ cutscene.\n\n: The defending team will be waiting for the attackers near the\
      \ train. The [[Sniper Rifle]] and the [[Shock Rifle]] are the more interesting\
      \ weapons in the loadout here. Headshots and shock combo's are most effective\
      \ for fighting off the attackers in the descending corridor. A combination of\
      \ Rocket Launchers and explosive barrels will be the best option for fighting\
      \ off the attackers who've made it past the corridor.\n\n== Weapons & Pickups\
      \ ==\n{{sectstub}}\n=== Weapons ===\n=== Pickups ===\n*4x Shield Pack\n\n==Tips\
      \ & tricks==\n;Offensive\n: Most of the enemy Minigun Turrets can be avoided\
      \ by using the large pieces of junk as coverage. In a number of cases there\
      \ are barrels right next to a Minigun Turret. Blowing these up will help the\
      \ attacker take down the Minigun Turret faster. There are also barrels near\
      \ some of the attacker's objectives (like the switch on the forward outpost).\
      \ Destroy these before the defending team does.\n\n;Defensive\n: The defending\
      \ team can use the barrels to stall the attackers. They also have better access\
      \ to Shield Packs. The gate locks are perhaps the easiest to defend due to their\
      \ positioning. A group of well-stacked defenders should be able to hold of the\
      \ attackers for a long time. Also remember that the Minigun Turrets can be healed\
      \ using the [[Link Gun]]'s alt-fire  \n=== Single-Player tips ===\n{{sectstub}}\n\

      \n==Trivia==\n* There's a advertisement in the bunker for \"Phil's Bagels\"\
      , which is a reference to Epic level designer [[Phil Cole]] (AKA willhaven)\
      \ and his well-known obsession for bagels.\n* According to the official Unreal\
      \ timeline, the whole event took place in 2219.<ref>Unreal [[Timeline]]</ref>\n\
