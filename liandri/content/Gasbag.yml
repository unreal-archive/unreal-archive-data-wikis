      \ <a href=\"/Nali_Castle\" title=\"Nali Castle\">Nali Castle</a>. As the name\
      \ indicates, the Giant Gasbag is much larger than the regular Gasbag, at approximately\
      \ three times the size. Its health, punch, pound, and projectile damage are\
      \ also 2-3 times greater.\n</p><p>When in a fight, the Giant Gasbag will spawn\
      \ up to 2 regular Gasbags for assistance. When one of these Gasbags dies, the\
      \ Giant Gasbag will spawn another to take its place. Although these Gasbags\
      \ are meant to help the Giant Gasbag, they will often fight each other when\
      \ left alone (resulting in the Giant Gasbag killing the regular Gasbag). \n\
      </p><p>Much like the regular Gasbags, its main tactic is to hit the target from\
      \ the air, using its powerful projectiles, while moving in to pound and/or punch\
      \ the target. Spawning Gasbags is another one of the Giant Gasbag's main priorities,\
      \ and it will often cease its attack briefly to spawn a new Gasbag. What this\
      \ Gasbags wins in power, it loses in agility. Its inability to evade shots like\
      \ regular Gasbags do, combined with its sheer size and the enclosed space in\
      \ which it resides, make shorter-range weapons effective as well. Be sure to\
      \ stay away from its arms though, as its punches are not nearly as harmless\
      \ as those of the regular gasbag.\n<br /><br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"\
