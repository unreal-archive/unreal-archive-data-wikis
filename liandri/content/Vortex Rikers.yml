      \ vessel. In this first level you will have to make it your priority to find\
      \ a basic weapon and get some health. Having just crashed you are severely injured,\
      \ and have only 12%. You have also been completely stripped of your worldly\
      \ possessions, so have nothing with which to begin your journey.\n</p><p>What\
      \ you do next is crucial to the whole game. Step out of your cell, and walk\
      \ to the far end of the prison promenade. Take the lift, and take the <a href=\"\
      /Universal_Translator\" title=\"Universal Translator\">Universal Translator</a>\
      \ from the dead guard. Throughout the game the Universal Translator will be\
      \ used to relay messages and important information about your surroundings to\
      \ you, so it is important that you get it first.\n</p><p>Now we are ready to\
      \ go, and can start to explore the wrecked ship. Drop back down to the floor,\
      \ and explore the cells. Going clockwise from the back right; the first cell\
      \ reveals nothing but a corpse. The next cell is more rewarding, with +5 health\
      \ <a href=\"/Bandage\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bandage\">Bandages</a>\
      \ atop the blood-filled toilet. Continuing, cell 3 is empty, but cell 4 has\
      \ a diary which you can read with the Universal Translator you collected (press\
      \ F2) [1].\n</p><p>Cell 5 is empty except for a highly dismembered corpse and\
      \ cell 6 is of course your own, so let's move on. Before going back up the lift,\
      \ take a detour to see a display of Unreal's special effects. Head for the dark\
      \ opening on the promenade and press the small light object on the right. This\
      \ lever sends the floor down as a lift.\n</p><p>Head over to the control panel\
      \ to the right. Approach it, and you will receive a message [2].\n</p><p>Look\
      \ through the glass at the electric chair, and be both amused and disgusted\
      \ as the corpse in the chair is spectacularly gibbed!\n</p><p>Now return and\
      \ ride the lifts back up to where you found the Universal Translator. Let's\
      \ explore the remaining cells, starting with the furthest on the left and going\
      \ anticlockwise. The first cell reveals a diary [3].\n</p><p>Cell 2 reveals\
      \ a corpse and a blocked toilet, but most importantly a <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"\
      Flare\">Flare</a> which you can collect and use to light up dark areas later.\
      \ Cell 3 reveals just another corpse, so cross over to cell 4, reading the monitors\
      \ as you go past [4,5].\n</p><p>Cell 4 will provide a handy +20 <a href=\"/Health_Pack\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Health Pack\">Health Pack</a>. Watch out as\
      \ you approach cell 5, for there will be explosions as a light fitting collapses\
      \ and you might just get squished. Cell 5 reveals another log [6].\n</p><p>Cell\
      \ 6 reveals only a blocked toilet, so it's time to move on. The door at this\
      \ end of the balcony will not open, so instead, head up the air duct with the\
      \ missing grille. The duct is noisy and full of a green fog; don't worry about\
      \ that, it's harmless. As you walk though be prepared for a sudden exposion\
      \ ahead. You might even catch sight of a creature darting away at the far end...\
      \ but ignore it. Moving on, the music will start as you enter the bridge. Look\
      \ at the consoles - mind the \"corpse\" - and read the logs [7-9].\n</p><p>Now\
      \ hop off on to the level below. Head up the steps and through the door beneath\
      \ the consoles. Push the lever to ride the lift up into the armoury, where you\
      \ will see a Kevlar Suit <a href=\"/Armor\" title=\"Armor\">armor</a> item behind\
      \ a forcefield. To deactivate the field, jump and head-butt the blue switch\
      \ on the power conduit. Having collected the suit, head along the slippery corridor\
      \ collecting the Health Pack as you go. Emerging back on to the bridge deck,\
      \ take a moment to step on to the beams to the right. If you fall off, go back\
      \ up through the Armoury and try again. Collect the Clips (<a href=\"/Automag\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a> / <a href=\"/Minigun\"\
      \ title=\"Minigun\">Minigun</a> ammo) from atop the beams then drop down to\
      \ the floor via the Health Pack on the intermediate level. Follow the corridor.\
      \ Beware explosions and the dancing electric cable. The far end of the next\
      \ room reveals a Health Pack and a computer log [10].\n</p><p>Follow the door\
      \ marked \"Med Lab\" into the red room with nothing of interest except for some\
      \ Health Packs which should take you to 100% by now. Enter the next corridor,\
      \ and the door will shut behind you. Although you will seem to be trapped, there\
      \ is a crack visible under the next door. Something is going on in there: there\
      \ is a growl, yells, sounds of gunfire and flashing lights... then the door\
      \ will open to a spread of body parts and the sight of a strange reptilian humanoid\
      \ running away. Ignore it for now...\n</p><p>Entering the room, you can now\
      \ collect your first weapon, the self-recharging <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\"\
      \ title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a>. Proceed down the hall -\
      \ the music which stopped as you entered the Med Lab now restarts as you realise\
      \ that the creature has vanished. Follow the corridor past broken corpses and\
      \ go through the door marked \"Area C\". On the right of this room is a Health\
      \ Pack behind glass that can be shot to pieces if required. From here, take\
      \ the right of the two fan ducts, which is damaged and contains no blades. You\
      \ will arrive at a lift and some consoles with a log [11].\n</p><p>Now, press\
      \ the switch on the console and wait for the cargo lift to descend. Step aboard\
      \ and it will rise automatically to the walkway above. Continue through the\
      \ \"Area B\" door - mind the ship-quake - then along to the far end of the area\
      \ through the bars. One more log here on the consoles [12].\n</p><p>That done,\
      \ shoot the glass on the wall marked \"In case of emergency - break glass\"\
      . The switch beneath will activate, and a trap door on the floor will open.\
      \ Jump down the escape duct to complete the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

    text: "''For the ship of the same name, see the [[UMS Vortex Rikers]].\n\n[[Image:Vortexrikers.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]\n\
      '''Vortex Rikers''' is the first map in [[Unreal]]'s single player game.\n;\
      \ Author : [[Cliff Bleszinski]]\n; Description\n: The prison ship in which the\
      \ player, [[Prisoner 849]], was being transported has crashed into the surface\
      \ of the [[Nali]] planet, [[Na Pali]]. The injured player must explore the tortured\
      \ ship, avoiding collapsing gantries and dangling cables, in order to find a\
      \ weapon, regain his health and, above all, work out what the heck is going\
      \ on.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Weapons and Items==\nNew\n* [[Bandages]]\n* [[Universal\
      \ Translator]]\n* [[Health Pack]]\n* [[Flare]]\n* [[Automag|Clip]]\n* [[Armor|Kelvar\
      \ Suit]]\n* [[Dispersion Pistol]]\n\n==Creatures and Enemies==\nNew\n* [[Skaarj\
      \ Warrior]] - Non-fighting appearance\n\n==Walkthrough==\nIt all begins in the\
      \ wreck of your prison transport vessel. In this first level you will have to\
      \ make it your priority to find a basic weapon and get some health. Having just\
      \ crashed you are severely injured, and have only 12%. You have also been completely\
      \ stripped of your worldly possessions, so have nothing with which to begin\
      \ your journey.\n\nWhat you do next is crucial to the whole game. Step out of\
      \ your cell, and walk to the far end of the prison promenade. Take the lift,\
      \ and take the [[Universal Translator]] from the dead guard. Throughout the\
      \ game the Universal Translator will be used to relay messages and important\
      \ information about your surroundings to you, so it is important that you get\
      \ it first.\n\nNow we are ready to go, and can start to explore the wrecked\
      \ ship. Drop back down to the floor, and explore the cells. Going clockwise\
      \ from the back right; the first cell reveals nothing but a corpse. The next\
      \ cell is more rewarding, with +5 health [[Bandage]]s atop the blood-filled\
      \ toilet. Continuing, cell 3 is empty, but cell 4 has a diary which you can\
      \ read with the Universal Translator you collected (press F2) [1].\n\nCell 5\
      \ is empty except for a highly dismembered corpse and cell 6 is of course your\
      \ own, so let's move on. Before going back up the lift, take a detour to see\
      \ a display of Unreal's special effects. Head for the dark opening on the promenade\
      \ and press the small light object on the right. This lever sends the floor\
      \ down as a lift.\n\nHead over to the control panel to the right. Approach it,\
      \ and you will receive a message [2].\n\nLook through the glass at the electric\
      \ chair, and be both amused and disgusted as the corpse in the chair is spectacularly\
      \ gibbed!\n\nNow return and ride the lifts back up to where you found the Universal\
      \ Translator. Let's explore the remaining cells, starting with the furthest\
      \ on the left and going anticlockwise. The first cell reveals a diary [3].\n\
      \nCell 2 reveals a corpse and a blocked toilet, but most importantly a [[Flare]]\
      \ which you can collect and use to light up dark areas later. Cell 3 reveals\
      \ just another corpse, so cross over to cell 4, reading the monitors as you\
      \ go past [4,5].\n\nCell 4 will provide a handy +20 [[Health Pack]]. Watch out\
      \ as you approach cell 5, for there will be explosions as a light fitting collapses\
      \ and you might just get squished. Cell 5 reveals another log [6].\n\nCell 6\
      \ reveals only a blocked toilet, so it's time to move on. The door at this end\
      \ of the balcony will not open, so instead, head up the air duct with the missing\
      \ grille. The duct is noisy and full of a green fog; don't worry about that,\
      \ it's harmless. As you walk though be prepared for a sudden exposion ahead.\
      \ You might even catch sight of a creature darting away at the far end... but\
      \ ignore it. Moving on, the music will start as you enter the bridge. Look at\
      \ the consoles - mind the \"corpse\" - and read the logs [7-9].\n\nNow hop off\
      \ on to the level below. Head up the steps and through the door beneath the\
      \ consoles. Push the lever to ride the lift up into the armoury, where you will\
      \ see a Kevlar Suit [[armor]] item behind a forcefield. To deactivate the field,\
      \ jump and head-butt the blue switch on the power conduit. Having collected\
      \ the suit, head along the slippery corridor collecting the Health Pack as you\
      \ go. Emerging back on to the bridge deck, take a moment to step on to the beams\
      \ to the right. If you fall off, go back up through the Armoury and try again.\
      \ Collect the Clips ([[Automag]] / [[Minigun]] ammo) from atop the beams then\
      \ drop down to the floor via the Health Pack on the intermediate level. Follow\
      \ the corridor. Beware explosions and the dancing electric cable. The far end\
      \ of the next room reveals a Health Pack and a computer log [10].\n\nFollow\
      \ the door marked \"Med Lab\" into the red room with nothing of interest except\
      \ for some Health Packs which should take you to 100% by now. Enter the next\
      \ corridor, and the door will shut behind you. Although you will seem to be\
      \ trapped, there is a crack visible under the next door. Something is going\
      \ on in there: there is a growl, yells, sounds of gunfire and flashing lights...\
      \ then the door will open to a spread of body parts and the sight of a strange\
      \ reptilian humanoid running away. Ignore it for now...\n\nEntering the room,\
      \ you can now collect your first weapon, the self-recharging [[Dispersion Pistol]].\
      \ Proceed down the hall - the music which stopped as you entered the Med Lab\
      \ now restarts as you realise that the creature has vanished. Follow the corridor\
      \ past broken corpses and go through the door marked \"Area C\". On the right\
      \ of this room is a Health Pack behind glass that can be shot to pieces if required.\
      \ From here, take the right of the two fan ducts, which is damaged and contains\
      \ no blades. You will arrive at a lift and some consoles with a log [11].\n\n\
      Now, press the switch on the console and wait for the cargo lift to descend.\
      \ Step aboard and it will rise automatically to the walkway above. Continue\
      \ through the \"Area B\" door - mind the ship-quake - then along to the far\
      \ end of the area through the bars. One more log here on the consoles [12].\n\
      \nThat done, shoot the glass on the wall marked \"In case of emergency - break\
      \ glass\". The switch beneath will activate, and a trap door on the floor will\
      \ open. Jump down the escape duct to complete the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n\
