      <p>Did I get UAnthology first? Nope. First I played the UT2004 demo, and really\
      \ got into it. That was back in 2004 03. I still have the CD including the UT2004\
      \ demo in my CD archive (I got it from a multi-content CD that are sometimes\
      \ included in PC magazines)... That introduced me to the Unreal universe.\n\
      </p><p>After that, I decided to see what started all of that. That's how I got\
      \ Unreal. And that's when I started creating custom content. I learned UEd1\
      \ there, attempted to make a few maps... The first test map made by me was a\
      \ small cubic egyptian-themed map for exploring - I made it following the Wolf's\
      \ tutorial from his site, and later on I used the TCUERG from OldUnreal. As\
      \ I generally like the <a href=\"/Nakhti\" title=\"Nakhti\">Nakhti</a> theme,\
      \ and one texture pack that was included with an egypt-styled map was partially\
      \ corrupt, I made a texture pack called Egypt4Unreal.utx from that texture pack\
      \ (all of the textures that were not broken). After some time I got quite a\
      \ nice library and assembled Egypt4Unreal2.utx, which I still have - it includes\
      \ all of the egyptian themes I could find for Unreal.\n</p><p>So later on, in\
      \ around 2006, I started converting Unreal SP maps to DM. First I tried to convert\
      \ the Sunspire, but it was so big that 16 bots weren't enough. My first successful\
      \ attempt in converting was DM-StoneThrone, I still have it and use it. That\
      \ map is really fun! It's a conversion of Velora Passage, a special edition\
      \ for RTNP and UGold users (but useable in U1 as well) that can use Terran Weapon\
      \ Match - that map has a trick that allows all of the 13 weapons in the match.\
      \ Actually the trick works even in UT, where the weapons have the old appearance...\
      \ And this map was the first published one.\n</p><p>The first published map\
      \ with my elements was DM-FrozenEgypt. Yeap, a Nakhti themed map! Well, partially.\
      \ The top level of it is a converted Watcher of the Skies, while the lower area\
      \ is Nakhti themed with mysterious chambers... First published my own map was\
      \ DM-10ball, a Skaarj themed map with a lot of teleporters, a few secrets and\
      \ 10 rooms that are identical from the first glance.\n</p><p>Somewhere late\
      \ 2006/early 2007 I got UT. When I found out that it was absolutely compatible\
      \ with Unreal, I was really amazed. Had a few issues though, but overall it\
      \ was OK. I came up with a huge idea for DM-InfernoTown, a conversion from 2D\
      \ Heroes III town preview, when I noticed that those buildings there look like\
      \ created just for Unreal. From then I tried recreating a few pieces of the\
      \ town, unfortunately, BSP errors destroyed a few parts and my enthusiasm. Though\
      \ I still have the parts I converted, I didn't create anything new by myself\
      \ since then. Have to say that some parts of DM-InfernoTown were really looking\
      \ good and maybe I could continue my work if someone teaches me how to avoid\
      \ those BSP errors... If you are interested, you can see a few screenies here:\
      \ <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.oldunreal.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1201194002\"\
      >http://www.oldunreal.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1201194002</a> And if you\
      \ want to see IMO the best screenshot, it's this one: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\
      external free\" href=\"http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/3513/shot3gk2.png\"\
      >http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/3513/shot3gk2.png</a>\n</p><p>At the same\
      \ time I started converting Unreal SP maps to UT. I like Domination the most,\
      \ as it is not shape-dependent. I created a DOM map of beta Bluff Eversmoking\
      \ with 5 DOM points that is very fun to play too. There were a few more convertions,\
      \ like DOM of RTNP's Neve's Crossing.\n</p><p>UT was very close to perfection\
      \ because each match gave me something new. Mods like XMaps and Arena Match\
      \ made each match very unique. Generally I like customisation and randomisation.\
      \ So random things each match was really very fun to me.\n</p><p>After that\
      \ I got Unreal 2 and after completing it and seeing that U2XMP is dead, I started\
      \ my quest of moving U2 weapons to other Unreal series games... First I tried\
      \ creating a few Unreal 2 Deathmatch and Capture the Flag maps (yes, it's possible),\
      \ but as there were not enough people playing U2 I gave up and tried exporting\
      \ the weapons. First attempts were to UT, but for the lack of skeletal animation\
      \ the idea failed as well. I also thought to convert them to U1 which got Skeletal\
      \ support with 227 patch, but then I got UT2004 and decided that it's easier\
      \ there. But first things first...\n</p><p>After U2 I got UT2003 and was re-amazed\
      \ by the graphics. All of the small things such as sand flowing through the\
      \ blocks in Nakhti (wee!) themed maps, flames by particles, detailed levels\
      \ etc. added a really nice touch. There were a few bad things there though,\
      \ but it was still OK. There I tried converting BR, CTF and DDOM maps to DM,\
      \ and that was really successful. Unfortunately UT2003 was not so random as\
      \ UT was. But the graphics took my attention. I also found a few converted levels\
      \ from the classic titles, like DM-ArizAII2k3 or DM-HealPod2003. They brought\
      \ the classic feel back.\n</p><p>Then I got UAnthology and UT2004 with it. That\
      \ proved to be the top-notch. With the latest MapMixer it is even more random\
      \ than UT, and movement was really a lot more free and fun (when I got to play\
      \ UT I really felt like a huge brick... What the hell, I can't lift off the\
      \ ground?). Onslaught is also very interesting. The fact that most of the mods\
      \ nowadays are for UT2004 and that there's an active online community made me\
      \ concentrate on UT2004. The fact that UT2004 supports <a href=\"/VCTF\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"VCTF\">VCTF</a> (Thanks Liandri Archives!&#160;;) ) made\
      \ me convert Onslaught maps to VCTF, and continue the work on converting all\
      \ sorts of maps to DM. That's what I'm still doing at the moment.\n</p><p>Before\
      \ I never had anything with UnrealScript. But since UT2004 I started learning\
      \ something. Why? Well, remember the U2 part of this article? UT2004 has a Total\
      \ Conversion mod UTXMP which - yeap - includes most of the U2 weapons! It seems\
      \ that it's done, there are U2 weapons in UT2004, but no - it's only in TC UTXMP\
      \ that is just as dead as U2XMP is. Well, maybe slightly less... But anyway,\
      \ I decided to port those weapons to the usual UT2004. For that I needed UScript\
      \ knowledge. So I learned a thing or two, but still my knowledge is very limited.\
      \ It's enough for that kind of mod though. So now I have successfully converted\
      \ most of the U2 weapons to UT2004 - all I need now is to solve a few things,\
      \ ask for permission and publish the mod&#160;:) I can say that UTXMP weapons\
      \ are really, really fun in UT2004. It's a well-worth thing having them! Most\
      \ of the work needed now is the configuration menu - it will be huge, as you\
      \ know how I like configuration&#160;:)\n</p><p>As of 06:36, 10 March 2009 (EDT),\
      \ I've already finished the mod (still needs debugging though), and I now have\
      \ <a href=\"/UT3\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UT3\">UT3</a>, so I'll start\
      \ modding for it too. Older games won't be forgotten as well - I still have\
      \ to finish my <a href=\"/UT2003\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UT2003\">UT2003</a>\
      \ Style mutators, UT3 Style mutators (<a href=\"/UT2004\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"UT2004\">UT2004</a>), Minor Deployables code for <a href=\"/Unreal_II\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Unreal II\">Unreal II</a>: <a href=\"/XMP\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"XMP\">XMP</a> and other projects I've started.\
      \ Yet UT3 is very fun and it will now be my primary target. I now have quite\
      \ a medium amount of UScript knowledge, so I can create mods that are a lot\
      \ better than I did earlier.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"TODO_list\"\

    text: "Just to make the signature appear as normal... :)\n\nI methodically update\
      \ articles by using the following Wiki tools:\n*[[Special:Wantedpages|Most Wanted\
      \ Pages]]\n*[[Special:Random|Random page]]\n\nAnd I'm also thinking of using\
      \ the [[:Category:Stubs]], but haven't used it yet.\n\nUsing only PC, so Unreal\
      \ Championship knowledge is approx. 0, but I tend to read about it and get some\
      \ parts of them.\n\nBut I own [[Unreal Anthology]], so I have quite a good knowledge\
      \ of [[Unreal]], [[Unreal - Return to Na Pali]], [[Unreal Tournament]], [[Unreal\
      \ 2]], [[Unreal Tournament 2004]] and, as I have it as well, [[Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003]]. Only [[Unreal Tournament 3]] won't work on my older laptop...\n\n\
      To make the long story in the next paragraph short, I'm converting maps, have\
      \ created a few and work on a mod. Trying to expand LA too. Also the author\
      \ of some crazy ideas, such as [[Harbinger]] = [[Hellbender]] and [[Prisoner\
      \ 849]] = [[Juggernauts|Frostbite]], as well as a few stories.\n\nFor those\
      \ who want to see some interesting speculation about [[Unreal]]'s history I\
      \ suggest going to [http://www.oldunreal.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1203646577\
      \ this Oldunreal forums thread]. If you want to only see my speculation story\
      \ about [[The Sunspire]], see [[User:GreatEmerald/Sunspire Story]]. Also take\
      \ a look at [[Talk:Prisoner 849]] for another speculation story.\n\nYou can\
      \ see the list of my TODO in Liandri Archives at the bottom, and an expanded\
      \ list of what I am currently doing/did in Unreal games in my [[User:GreatEmerald/Worklist|Worklist]].\n\
      \n==History/Work==\nDid I get UAnthology first? Nope. First I played the UT2004\
      \ demo, and really got into it. That was back in 2004 03. I still have the CD\
      \ including the UT2004 demo in my CD archive (I got it from a multi-content\
      \ CD that are sometimes included in PC magazines)... That introduced me to the\
      \ Unreal universe.\n\nAfter that, I decided to see what started all of that.\
      \ That's how I got Unreal. And that's when I started creating custom content.\
      \ I learned UEd1 there, attempted to make a few maps... The first test map made\
      \ by me was a small cubic egyptian-themed map for exploring - I made it following\
      \ the Wolf's tutorial from his site, and later on I used the TCUERG from OldUnreal.\
      \ As I generally like the [[Nakhti]] theme, and one texture pack that was included\
      \ with an egypt-styled map was partially corrupt, I made a texture pack called\
      \ Egypt4Unreal.utx from that texture pack (all of the textures that were not\
      \ broken). After some time I got quite a nice library and assembled Egypt4Unreal2.utx,\
      \ which I still have - it includes all of the egyptian themes I could find for\
      \ Unreal.\n\nSo later on, in around 2006, I started converting Unreal SP maps\
      \ to DM. First I tried to convert the Sunspire, but it was so big that 16 bots\
      \ weren't enough. My first successful attempt in converting was DM-StoneThrone,\
      \ I still have it and use it. That map is really fun! It's a conversion of Velora\
      \ Passage, a special edition for RTNP and UGold users (but useable in U1 as\
      \ well) that can use Terran Weapon Match - that map has a trick that allows\
      \ all of the 13 weapons in the match. Actually the trick works even in UT, where\
      \ the weapons have the old appearance... And this map was the first published\
      \ one.\n\nThe first published map with my elements was DM-FrozenEgypt. Yeap,\
      \ a Nakhti themed map! Well, partially. The top level of it is a converted Watcher\
      \ of the Skies, while the lower area is Nakhti themed with mysterious chambers...\
      \ First published my own map was DM-10ball, a Skaarj themed map with a lot of\
      \ teleporters, a few secrets and 10 rooms that are identical from the first\
      \ glance.\n\nSomewhere late 2006/early 2007 I got UT. When I found out that\
      \ it was absolutely compatible with Unreal, I was really amazed. Had a few issues\
      \ though, but overall it was OK. I came up with a huge idea for DM-InfernoTown,\
      \ a conversion from 2D Heroes III town preview, when I noticed that those buildings\
      \ there look like created just for Unreal. From then I tried recreating a few\
      \ pieces of the town, unfortunately, BSP errors destroyed a few parts and my\
      \ enthusiasm. Though I still have the parts I converted, I didn't create anything\
      \ new by myself since then. Have to say that some parts of DM-InfernoTown were\
      \ really looking good and maybe I could continue my work if someone teaches\
      \ me how to avoid those BSP errors... If you are interested, you can see a few\
      \ screenies here: http://www.oldunreal.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1201194002\
      \ And if you want to see IMO the best screenshot, it's this one: http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/3513/shot3gk2.png\n\
      \nAt the same time I started converting Unreal SP maps to UT. I like Domination\
      \ the most, as it is not shape-dependent. I created a DOM map of beta Bluff\
      \ Eversmoking with 5 DOM points that is very fun to play too. There were a few\
      \ more convertions, like DOM of RTNP's Neve's Crossing.\n\nUT was very close\
      \ to perfection because each match gave me something new. Mods like XMaps and\
      \ Arena Match made each match very unique. Generally I like customisation and\
      \ randomisation. So random things each match was really very fun to me.\n\n\
      After that I got Unreal 2 and after completing it and seeing that U2XMP is dead,\
      \ I started my quest of moving U2 weapons to other Unreal series games... First\
      \ I tried creating a few Unreal 2 Deathmatch and Capture the Flag maps (yes,\
      \ it's possible), but as there were not enough people playing U2 I gave up and\
      \ tried exporting the weapons. First attempts were to UT, but for the lack of\
      \ skeletal animation the idea failed as well. I also thought to convert them\
      \ to U1 which got Skeletal support with 227 patch, but then I got UT2004 and\
      \ decided that it's easier there. But first things first...\n\nAfter U2 I got\
      \ UT2003 and was re-amazed by the graphics. All of the small things such as\
      \ sand flowing through the blocks in Nakhti (wee!) themed maps, flames by particles,\
      \ detailed levels etc. added a really nice touch. There were a few bad things\
      \ there though, but it was still OK. There I tried converting BR, CTF and DDOM\
      \ maps to DM, and that was really successful. Unfortunately UT2003 was not so\
      \ random as UT was. But the graphics took my attention. I also found a few converted\
      \ levels from the classic titles, like DM-ArizAII2k3 or DM-HealPod2003. They\
      \ brought the classic feel back.\n\nThen I got UAnthology and UT2004 with it.\
      \ That proved to be the top-notch. With the latest MapMixer it is even more\
      \ random than UT, and movement was really a lot more free and fun (when I got\
      \ to play UT I really felt like a huge brick... What the hell, I can't lift\
      \ off the ground?). Onslaught is also very interesting. The fact that most of\
      \ the mods nowadays are for UT2004 and that there's an active online community\
      \ made me concentrate on UT2004. The fact that UT2004 supports [[VCTF]] (Thanks\
      \ Liandri Archives! ;) ) made me convert Onslaught maps to VCTF, and continue\
      \ the work on converting all sorts of maps to DM. That's what I'm still doing\
      \ at the moment.\n\nBefore I never had anything with UnrealScript. But since\
      \ UT2004 I started learning something. Why? Well, remember the U2 part of this\
      \ article? UT2004 has a Total Conversion mod UTXMP which - yeap - includes most\
      \ of the U2 weapons! It seems that it's done, there are U2 weapons in UT2004,\
      \ but no - it's only in TC UTXMP that is just as dead as U2XMP is. Well, maybe\
      \ slightly less... But anyway, I decided to port those weapons to the usual\
      \ UT2004. For that I needed UScript knowledge. So I learned a thing or two,\
      \ but still my knowledge is very limited. It's enough for that kind of mod though.\
      \ So now I have successfully converted most of the U2 weapons to UT2004 - all\
      \ I need now is to solve a few things, ask for permission and publish the mod\
      \ :) I can say that UTXMP weapons are really, really fun in UT2004. It's a well-worth\
      \ thing having them! Most of the work needed now is the configuration menu -\
      \ it will be huge, as you know how I like configuration :)\n\nAs of 06:36, 10\
      \ March 2009 (EDT), I've already finished the mod (still needs debugging though),\
      \ and I now have [[UT3]], so I'll start modding for it too. Older games won't\
      \ be forgotten as well - I still have to finish my [[UT2003]] Style mutators,\
      \ UT3 Style mutators ([[UT2004]]), Minor Deployables code for [[Unreal II]]:\
      \ [[XMP]] and other projects I've started. Yet UT3 is very fun and it will now\
      \ be my primary target. I now have quite a medium amount of UScript knowledge,\
      \ so I can create mods that are a lot better than I did earlier.\n\n==TODO list==\n\
