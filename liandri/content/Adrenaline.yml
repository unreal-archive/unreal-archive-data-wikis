    text: "'''Adrenaline''' is a power-up system that is part of [[Unreal Tournament\
      \ 2003|UT2003]], [[Unreal Tournament 2004|UT2004]], [[Unreal Championship]],\
      \ and [[Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict|Unreal Championship 2]].\n\
      \n==UT2003, UT2004, and UC==\nAdrenaline can be collected by picking up adrenaline\
      \ pills scattered throughout the arenas, or by achieving certain goals, such\
      \ as killing opponents and capturing [[Capture the Flag|flags]]. It was originally\
      \ thought of to allow breaking through stalemates in team-based games.\n\nIn\
      \ UT2003 pills give the player 3 Adrenaline points, whereas in UT2004 they give\
      \ the player 2. Adrenaline doesn't feature in [[Last Man Standing]], [[Onslaught]]\
      \ and [[Assault]]. Because Adrenaline adds a certain amount of randomness it\
      \ is often manually disabled in competitive games. A notable exception is [[TAM]],\
      \ where adrenaline is a key part of the strategy.\n\nOnce 100 Adrenaline points\
      \ have been collected, the player can start an \"adrenaline rush\" by quickly\
      \ executing a sequence of movement keys. This rush will give the player an advantage,\
      \ but only for a limited amount of time. If the player carries the [[Capture\
      \ the Flag|flag]] or [[Bombing Run|bomb]] in the relevant gametypes, the amount\
      \ is shortened.\n\n===Gathering===\nBelow is a list of methods of gathering\
      \ adrenaline, and the associated amount gathered.\n*Get pill: 2 (in [[UT2004]],\
      \ 3 in [[UT2003]])\n*Frag in [[DM]]/[[TDM]]: 5\n*Frag in [[CTF]]/[[BR]]/[[DDOM]]:\
      \ 2\n*First blood: 10\n*Spree: 10\n*Ending enemy's spree: 10\n*Multi Kill: 10\n\
      *Death: 0\n*Suicide: -2\n*Frag Flag/Bomb carrier: 10\n*Return Flag/Bomb: 5\n\
      *Capture Flag/Bomb: 25\n\n===Combos===\nBelow is a list of combos showing the\
      \ key sequence needed, an estimate of the amount of time the rush lasts in seconds,\
      \ and the result of the combo. \"Pint-sized!\" and \"Camouflaged!\" are additional\
      \ combos than become available through official [[mutator]]s included in an\
      \ Epic bonus pack.\n\n* '''↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ Speed''' - (18) - Move faster, jump higher,\
      \ drawing yellow tracks with your feet. In UT2004 this combo lasts half as long\
      \ as most. It drains even faster if you are carrying the flag in a [[CTF]] or\
      \ [[VCTF]] game.\n* '''↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Booster''' - (27) - (Re)generate health up to\
      \ 199%, then shield up to 150%, by 5 points per second or so. The player will\
      \ emit green crosses.\n* '''→ → ← ← Invisibility''' (27) - Turn invisible, albeit\
      \ it with some shimmering effect\n* '''↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ Berserk''' (27) - Increases rate\
      \ of fire and knockback, including that of the [[Shield Gun]], allowing its\
      \ user to jump much higher with it. Three orange lines revolve around the player.\n\
      * '''← ← ← ← Pint-sized!''' (27) - Become half as big; disables crouching.\n\
      * '''→ → → → Camouflaged!''' (40.5) - Projects a, usually very conspicuous,\
      \ holographic object around the player. The object depends on the [[unreal:Static\
      \ mesh|static mesh]]es used in the map.\n\n===Trivia===\n\n====UT2003====\n\
      *Unreal Tournament 2003 had an adrenaline combo ''Superjump!'' that was added\
      \ to compensate the loss of the [[Jump Boots]] in UT2003. For unknown reasons\
      \ this combo didn't make it to the full release.\n*The unused announcement ''Berserker!''\
      \ might have been planned to be announced after excessive use of the ''Berserk!''\
      \ combo.\n\n====UT2004====\nThe adrenaline system in Unreal Tournament 2004\
      \ was originally intended to be a lot more complex, quite like the one of Unreal\
      \ Championship 2. The unused announcements still remain in the game and reveals\
      \ the combos that were planned but never made it:\n\n*Confusion - unknown, maybe\
      \ confuses enemies by showing multiple players instead of one.\n*Holograph -\
      \ probably was replaced by the Camouflaged combo.\n*Invulnerable - makes the\
      \ user invulnerable, like [[Invulnerability]] in UT3.\n*Low Grav - should work\
      \ somewhat like the Nimble combo in UC2, just simply makes the user low gravity.\n\
      *Retribution - kills or damages the user's killer after death. Probably like\
      \ the [[Relics|Vengeance relic]].\n*Silencer - makes the user absolutely silent\
      \ and harder to detect - weapons and footsteps can't be heard (works a bit like\
      \ the Acoustic [[Dampener]] in Unreal.\n*Whirlwind - unknown, maybe summons\
      \ a destructive whirlwind that works like the Gravity Vortex of ChaosUT2.\n\
      *Loaded - the user regenerates ammo.\n*Lock on - makes all user's weapons homing.\n\
      *Vampire - health taken is transferred to the user. Replaced by a mutator.\n\
      *Instagib (questionable) - gives you the Super Shock Rifle for a small amount\

      \ for [[Unreal Championship 2]], and plays a much more important role in combat\
      \ situations, because it can be constantly used. The majority of adrenaline\
      \ abilities are only using 50% of your adrenaline bar, while the bar refills\
      \ itself automatically. Adrenaline pick ups are shared in the same proportion\
      \ as ammunition, while one pick up fills 10% of the adrenaline bar. There is\
      \ also a [[Super Adrenaline]] power up, which gives you instantly 100%. Killing\
      \ opponents, capturing the flag in [[Capture the Flag|CTF]] games, delivering\
      \ the ball in [[Overdose]] or rejecting shots also scores you some extra adrenaline.\
      \ Adrenaline abilities can easily be activated by a small ingame menu.\n\nThe\
      \ different characters have different kinds of abilities available to them,\
      \ partly dependent on the character's race. Every character has six abilities\

      \ one character specific special ability. Race abilities mostly include one\
      \ defensive, one healing and a hunting ability. There 38 adrenaline abilities\
