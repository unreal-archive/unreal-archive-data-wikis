      <p><br />\n</p><p>The <b>Skaarj Queen</b> is the final boss in <a href=\"/Unreal\"\
      \ title=\"Unreal\">Unreal</a>, and is the most important of all the Skaarj.\n\
      She is over 20 feet tall, and has 2 fully-developed arms and legs, much like\
      \ other Skaarj classes. Her legs are quite different and appear to be avian\
      \ in structure and allow her to move faster than the player. The Queen also\
      \ has 2 less developed secondary legs, which she uses to keep her balance and\
      \ to stab her prey (explaining the blood stains). When walking, these limbs\
      \ seem to examine the surface in front of her feet, similar to how insects use\
      \ their antennas to get a sense of their surroundings. The Queen probably uses\
      \ these limbs as an extension to her eyes, as her eye height of roughly 19 feet\
      \ limits her view on the surface underneath/near her feet. \n</p><p>The Queen\
      \ normally seems rather peaceful, as her main occupations are meditating and\
      \ looking after her <a href=\"/Pupae\" title=\"Pupae\">Pupae</a>. Interestingly\
      \ enough, she won't hesitate to send her Pupae into battle when she is approached\
      \ by danger. When her Pupae die, she will simply call in for more. And of course,\
      \ being the top-class in the Skaarj hierarchy, she is more than capable of defending\
      \ her hive, <a href=\"/The_Source\" title=\"The Source\">The Source</a>. Her\
      \ main weapon is a series of projectiles coming from her 8 breasts. These are\
      \ the same projectiles as the <a href=\"/Skaarj_Warrior\" title=\"Skaarj Warrior\"\
      >Skaarj Warriors</a> use, with the exception that they move faster. The projectile\
      \ damage of 16hp may not seem much, but if the player is hit by all 8 projectiles,\
      \ it will sum up to a total of 128. She will also use up to 5 of her Pupae to\
      \ fight the prey. When one is killed, the Queen will belch out a ground-shaking\
      \ scream. Many believe that the Queen screams out of anger that her Pupa was\
      \ killed, but it is actually a scream to call new Pupae to the hive to take\
      \ the killed Pupae's place.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\"><div class=\"\

      <p>In battle she will often teleport to a good spot, some distance from her\
      \ target but with a clear view, and rapid-fire her projectiles. When the target\
      \ moves out of sight, she will simply teleport to a new location and try again.\
      \ When this doesn't work, she will run or teleport to the target and try to\
      \ stab/punch it to death. A stab from her secondary legs will cost 80hp, so\
      \ it goes without saying that one needs to away from her as much as possible.\
      \ The Queen will also try to tear you to gibs, if you have have a good amount\
      \ of <a href=\"/Health\" title=\"Health\">health</a> and armor points, you should\
      \ be okay. If you play on Monster Hunt maps for <a href=\"/Unreal_Tournament\"\
      \ title=\"Unreal Tournament\">Unreal Tournament</a>, such as HA-Queens, you're\
      \ screwed if she tries to tear you. So here is a tip: DO NOT GO NEAR THE QUEEN!!!\
      \ If you do need to get close up, thats fine, just don't get too near her. When\
      \ shot at, the Queen will use her impenetrable energy shield (similar to the\
      \ ones <a href=\"/Skaarj_Trooper\" title=\"Skaarj Trooper\">Skaarj Troopers</a>\
      \ use) to nullify the damage. The Skaarj Queen is also temporarilly invunerable\
