      \ adheres to both enemy vehicles and infantry, the detonation of which lies\
      \ completely in the hands of the weapon holder. When employed with creativity\
      \ and timing, the Grenade Launcher can be a very powerful weapon.</i>\n</p><p>Introduced\

      \ for the <a href=\"/Onslaught\" title=\"Onslaught\">Onslaught</a> gametype,\
      \ Grenade Launchers (weapon slot 7) shoot out projectiles which will bounce\
      \ or roll until they lose momentum or until they encounter an objective, player,\
      \ or enemy vehicle. Upon encountering one of these obstacles, the grenades will\
      \ stick to that object and explode when the player who shot the grenades presses\
      \ Secondary Fire, or when that player dies. An interesting application is to\
      \ attach a grenade to a teammate (if friendly fire is off) and then have that\
      \ teammate go on a suicide run into the enemy base. The exploding grenade will\
      \ not hurt the teammate, but it will hurt whoever is around him or her.\n</p><p>An\
      \ extension of the above tactic is to fill a vehicle with grenades then place\
      \ it in a highly visible position. When an enemy spots the vehicle and commandeers\
      \ it, detonate the grenades to kill him. A word of caution, though: this is\
      \ a VERY dirty tactic and should not be used against human players (or prepare\
      \ for heavy verbal attacks). Another possible method is to fill a Manta with\
      \ grenades, then jump in and go on a kamikaze run.\n</p><p>One of the most effective\
      \ weapons against stationary targets, and mobile as well, if wielded correctly.\n\

      \ Grenades can deal 80 damage.\n\n'''Primary Fire''': Throw a grenade which\

      \ fire, the grenade here never explodes by itself (it will pass through enemies).\
      \ It can only be activated by pressing the secondary fire's button again. In\
      \ the meanwhile you can also throw a normal grenade after throwing the alternate\
      \ one. Detonating this latter bomb causes both grenades to explode. The secondary\
      \ fire is often used for detonating the grenade sooner than the primary fire\
      \ grenade would, making it somewhat useful at close range.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Unreal\

      {{QuoteSource|The grenade launcher is an amazingly versatile and effective piece\
      \ of military hardware, perhaps the best all-around portable weapon in the Terran\
      \ arsenal.|Unreal II Manual|Unreal II: The Awakening}}\n\n[[Unreal II: The Awakening|Unreal\
      \ 2]]'s Grenade Launcher, the M406 Hydra, is named after the many-headed Lernaean\
      \ Hydra due to its ability to use multiple 40mm grenade types. At the beginning\
      \ of the game Dalton only has access to explosive fragmentation grenades, but\
      \ he will collect the other types along the way. Regular fire launches the currently\
      \ loaded grenade, whose explosion can be delayed by holding the trigger for\
      \ a short while. Alternate fire cycles through grenade types.\n\n[[Image:hydra_u2.jpg|thumb|right|The\
      \ first person view.]]\n\n*[[Image:GLFrag.png|25px]] '''Fragmentation''' (short:\
      \ '''Frag''') - ''Enormous explosive power and needle-sharp carbo-steel fragments.\
      \ Absolutely lethal in close quarters.'' This type of grenades is the usual\
      \ one. When fired, it explodes with a quite impressive blast radius. Does up\
      \ to 200 points of damage. This is the most common type of grenades and you\
      \ will usually have a lot of these. Due to the interesting coincidence, the\
      \ short name of this type of grenades is the same as the name of a kill.\n*[[Image:GLToxic.png|25px]]\
      \ '''Toxic gas''' (short: '''Toxic''') - ''Sprays out a cloud of neurotoxic\
      \ gas that is so caustic it eats through metal armor.'' This type of grenades\
      \ is the most useful in small rooms or slow enemies as it creates a cloud of\
      \ gas that drains the health from anyone in the area. Potentially the strongest\
      \ type of grenades. Be careful not to fall in yourself.\n*[[Image:GLInc.png|25px]]\
      \ '''Incendiary''' (short: '''Inc''') - ''Sprays burning phosphorus and will\
      \ set almost anything on fire.'' One of the commonly used grenade types, Incendiary\
      \ grenades will disorient enemies and deal more damage than Fragmentation grenades.\n\
      *[[Image:GLSmoke.png|25px]] '''Smoke''' - ''Lays down a smokescreen to help\
      \ you escape from your enemies.'' Not effective against bots, but very effective\
      \ against humans and will hide the player in XMP matches.\n*[[Image:GLConc.png|25px]]\
      \ '''Concussion''' (short: '''Conc''') - ''Sends out a shockwave that will knock\
      \ down most enemies.'' This grenade can be used to send enemies somewhere far,\
      \ far away, but it is famous for \"concussion jumps\" - as it does almost no\
      \ damage, but the shockwave throws people into the air, you can use the grenade\
      \ against yourself and jump further than you could normally.\n*[[Image:GLEMP.png|25px]]\
      \ '''EMP''' - ''Massive electro-magnetic pulse that will disable almost any\
      \ electrical system instantly.'' Very effective against [[deployables]] and\
      \ other electrical systems such as [[Drakk]]. Also heavily damages power suits.\n\
      \n\nIn [[XMP]] the Hydra works a little bit differently in that the different\
      \ classes carry simplified versions of the weapon that can only launch two grenade\
      \ types. Regular and alternate fire are dedicated to these two types. The Ranger\
      \ has access to the Frag and Smoke types, the Tech has EMP and toxic, and the\
      \ Gunner has Incendiary and Concussion.\n\n==Unreal Tournament 2004==\n{{Infobox_Weapon|\n\

      \ one of the most diverse weapons in current use, the Grenade Launcher can fire\
      \ up to eight grenades at a time, either seeding an entire area for later detonation,\
      \ or directly targeting enemies. Lined with electrostatic emitters, each grenade\
      \ adheres to both enemy vehicles and infantry, the detonation of which lies\
      \ completely in the hands of the weapon holder. When employed with creativity\
      \ and timing, the Grenade Launcher can be a very powerful weapon.''\n\nIntroduced\
      \ in [[Unreal Tournament 2004|UT2004]] for the [[Onslaught]] gametype, Grenade\
      \ Launchers (weapon slot 7) shoot out projectiles which will bounce or roll\
      \ until they lose momentum or until they encounter an objective, player, or\
      \ enemy vehicle. Upon encountering one of these obstacles, the grenades will\
      \ stick to that object and explode when the player who shot the grenades presses\
      \ Secondary Fire, or when that player dies. An interesting application is to\
      \ attach a grenade to a teammate (if friendly fire is off) and then have that\
      \ teammate go on a suicide run into the enemy base. The exploding grenade will\
      \ not hurt the teammate, but it will hurt whoever is around him or her.\n\n\
      An extension of the above tactic is to fill a vehicle with grenades then place\
      \ it in a highly visible position. When an enemy spots the vehicle and commandeers\
      \ it, detonate the grenades to kill him. A word of caution, though: this is\
      \ a VERY dirty tactic and should not be used against human players (or prepare\
      \ for heavy verbal attacks). Another possible method is to fill a Manta with\
      \ grenades, then jump in and go on a kamikaze run.\n\nOne of the most effective\
      \ weapons against stationary targets, and mobile as well, if wielded correctly.\n\
      \n== Unreal Championship 2 ==\n\n{{QuoteSource|The grenade launcher is the standard\
      \ canister gun loaded with explosive ammunition.  The primary fire is a grenade\
      \ which bounces off hard surfaces, and explodes either by proximity detection\
      \ or when its timer runs out.  The alt-fire shoots a mine that sticks to the\
      \ first surface it hits.  These mines detonate whenever they are within range\
      \ of another explosion.<br />The mines can also be detonated by holding down\
      \ alt-fire after shooting the grenade, then pulling fire.  It's possible to\
      \ build traps by laying a group of mines, then firing one last mine and waiting\
      \ for an enemy to walk through the area before detonating.  Mines can also be\
      \ detonated in the air, though this does less damage because they are not yet\
      \ fully armed.|Unreal Championship 2|UC2}}\n{{sectstub}}\nShoots small balls\
      \ that bounce around for a few seconds and explode when touched. Its secondary\
      \ shoots a mine that is remote triggered.\n\n==Other==\nThere are some other\
      \ weapons capable of launching grenades.\n\nThe [[Rocket Launcher]]s in [[Unreal]]\
      \ and [[Unreal Tournament]] have an alternate fire mode that launches up to\
      \ six grenades simultaneously. The Rocket Launcher in [[Unreal Tournament 3|UT3]]\
      \ can fire up to three grenades simultaneously. (Regular rockets are rocket\
      \ propelled grenades.)\n\nThe [[Assault Rifle]] in [[Unreal Tournament 2003|UT2003]]\
      \ and [[Unreal Tournament 2004|UT2004]] launches grenades at a speed (distance)\
      \ depending on the amount of time the alternate fire trigger was held. These\
      \ grenades use different ammo than regular fire.\n\n[[Category:Weapons]] [[Category:Projectile\
