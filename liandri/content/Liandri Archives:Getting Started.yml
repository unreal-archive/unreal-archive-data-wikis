      <p>Discussion pages, also referred to as talk pages, are where editors discuss\
      \ how they can improve the main article.  Anyone can ask a question, answer\

      \ two kinds of talk pages: Regular talk pages, which are used to discuss articles,\
      \ and user talk pages, which are used to talk with editors. The rules used on\
      \ discussion pages are slightly different from those on article pages.  <b>In\

      \ be removed. You should also integrate what you want to add into what we have\
      \ instead of creating something separate from the current content or even a\
      \ duplicate page. As for your tone while writing, make sure that it addresses\

      \ expected to behave in a civil manner at all times.\n</p><p>The most important\
      \ thing to do is to assume good faith with your fellow editors. Don't assume\
      \ that others are acting in spite or malice. If another editor does something\
      \ that is upsetting to you, leave a message on their talk page or where appropriate\
      \ and politely express your concerns. You may have avoided a potentially embarrassing\

      \ the community.\n* '''[[Project:Community Portal|Community Portal]]''': A page\
      \ devoted to general discussion of the site.  You are welcome to chime in with\
      \ your opinion on any of the issues, or bring up any new ones.\n* '''[[Project:Questions|Questions]]''':\
      \ How and where to ask questions.\n\nSome of the key ideas from these pages\
      \ are summarized in the following sections.\n\n==Creating an Account==\n\nYou\
      \ are free to edit the site without creating an account, but if you're interested\
      \ in doing more than just a few random edits, getting an account can be very\
      \ useful.  It's a [[Special:Userlogin|painless process]], it allows other editors\
      \ on the site to get to know you better (for example, seeing where your interests\
      \ lie), and gives you access to additional features.\n\nSee [[wikipedia:Project:Why\
      \ create an account?|Why create an account?]] on Wikipedia for more about account\
      \ creation.\n\n==How to Contribute==\n:''Main Article: [[Project:Helping Out|Helping\
      \ Out]]''\nThese are some of the basic ways that you can do to improve the site:\n\
      \n* '''Fix errors''' such as grammar or [[Project:Spelling|spelling]] mistakes.\
      \ Doing a lot of small fixes can greatly improve the quality of the site.\n\
      * '''Improve the content''' by rewording sentences and paragraphs so that they\
      \ are easier to understand.\n* '''Create new content.''' There are still many\
      \ subjects that haven't been described adequately or haven't been written about\
      \ at all. If you're knowledgeable on a subject, you can aid us in [[Help:Starting\
      \ New Pages|creating content]] for it.\n* '''Format pages.''' If you're good\
      \ with [[Help:Formatting|Wiki markup]], you can look for pages that need to\
      \ be improved visually.\n\n==Editing Pages==\n:''Main Article: [[Help:Editing\
      \ Pages|Editing Pages]]''\nIf you have something to contribute, you should add\
      \ it.  Don't worry (too much) about making mistakes.  Mistakes on the wiki are\
      \ [[Help:Editing Pages#Reverting Edits|pretty easy to fix]], and we would rather\
      \ have editors who contribute lots of information and make a few mistakes than\
      \ have editors who never add their information because they are too worried\
      \ about not being able to do it perfectly. Remember that perfection isn't required.\
      \  As you get more comfortable with the wiki, you'll probably want to familiarize\
      \ yourself with the [[Project:Style Guide|Style Guide]] and maybe even a few\
      \ other [[Project:Policies and Guidelines|policies and guidelines]] (nobody\
      \ wants to be a nublet forever!), but you're likely to learn as much from the\
      \ experience of actually editing as from reading about it. \n\nTo edit a page,\
      \ all you have to do is click the [edit] button on the top of the screen, make\
      \ your changes, preview them, then click on the \"Save page\" button. Your contribution\
      \ will automatically appear on the article.  You can play around with the editing\
      \ feature at our [[Project:Sandbox|sandbox]] – the place you can edit freely\
      \ without worrying about messing things up.\n\n===Wiki Markup===\n:''Main Article:\
      \ [[Help:Formatting|Formatting]]''\nYou can do many casual edits with little\
      \ to no knowledge of the wiki markup. However, if you want to become more serious\
      \ about editing and be able to format your edits so that they look better, you\
      \ will need to learn some basic wiki markup. We have a [[Help:Quick Editing\
      \ Guide|quick editing guide]] which explains the more simple commands, a more\
      \ general help page on [[Help:Formatting|formatting]], and you could also see\
      \ Wikimedia's [[metawikipedia:Help:Editing|editing walkthrough]] for more details.\n\
      \n===Discussion Pages===\n:''Main Article: [[Help:Editing Pages#Editing a Discussion\
      \ Page|Editing a Discussion Page]]''\nDiscussion pages, also referred to as\
      \ talk pages, are where editors discuss how they can improve the main article.\
      \  Anyone can ask a question, answer an existing question, or contribute to\
      \ an existing discussion.  There are two kinds of talk pages: Regular talk pages,\
      \ which are used to discuss articles, and user talk pages, which are used to\
      \ talk with editors. The rules used on discussion pages are slightly different\
      \ from those on article pages.  '''In particular, contributions to discussion\
      \ pages should always be signed''' (contributions to articles should never be\
      \ signed).\n\n==Keep In Mind==\n:''Main article: [[Project:Policies and Guidelines|Policies\
      \ and Guidelines]]''\nBefore you dive in and start editing, we do have a few\
      \ things that you should keep in mind.\n\n===Content Criteria===\n:''Main article:\
      \ [[Project:Style Guide|Style Guide]]''\nEven though everyone can edit, this\
      \ does not mean that the site is a free-for-all. Content submitted should always\
      \ be informative, verifiable, professional, and legible, and content that does\
      \ not uphold to these criteria will likely be removed. You should also integrate\
      \ what you want to add into what we have instead of creating something separate\
      \ from the current content or even a duplicate page. As for your tone while\
      \ writing, make sure that it addresses the reader when necessary and not yourself.\n\
      \n===Conduct===\n:''Main article: [[Project:Etiquette|Etiquette]]''\nWe promote\
      \ an atmosphere of kindness and friendliness, which is usually apparent when\
      \ examining the community of the site. However, at times there are sometimes\
      \ disagreements and even heated disputes among editors, but everyone here is\
      \ expected to behave in a civil manner at all times.\n\nThe most important thing\
      \ to do is to assume good faith with your fellow editors. Don't assume that\
      \ others are acting in spite or malice. If another editor does something that\
      \ is upsetting to you, leave a message on their talk page or where appropriate\
      \ and politely express your concerns. You may have avoided a potentially embarrassing\
      \ misunderstanding or a frivolous dispute.\n\n==In Conclusion==\nYou now know\
      \ the most important things that you need to know to contribute to the project.\
      \ Do you feel like something is missing or not adequately explained? Leave a\
      \ message on the [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|discussion]] so that we can improve it.\
      \ You should also introduce yourself to some of our active members in the project.\
      \ Create a user page and/or user talk page, leave an introduction on the [[Project:Community\
      \ Portal|community portal]]."
