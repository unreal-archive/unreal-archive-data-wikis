    text: "<p>The wiki <b>Style Guide</b> is designed to maintain consistency throughout\
      \ the site.  Since editors from all over the world make modifications and additions\
      \ to the wiki's articles, it is important for the project to have a uniform\
      \ format and style.  This article summarizes our recommended style guidelines,\
      \ that apply to all articles written on the site.  Articles that follow these\
      \ guidelines are more likely to be well-received by the rest of the community,\
      \ and will require other editors to spend less time cleaning up the articles.\n\
      </p><p>The style of <a href=\"/edit/Help:Namespaces?redlink=1\" class=\"new\"\
      \ title=\"Help:Namespaces (page does not exist)\">talk pages</a> is less formal\
      \ than that used for articles.  While most of these guidelines are still relevant\

      <p>The purpose of the Liandri Archives is to provide encyclopedia-style content\
      \ describing the Unreal games.  All articles should be informative and targeted\
      \ at the site's audience.  Information that is only of interest to the writer\
      \ or to other editors should not be included in articles.  The article's talk\
      \ page is the place to discuss questions about the article's content or style.\n\
      </p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Attribution_and_Dates\">Attribution\
      \ and Dates</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\

      \ section: Attribution and Dates\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Do not add any attributions (e.g., \"written by QAPete\"\
      ) or dates (e.g., \"written on Feb. 14, 2007\") when editing an article.  The\
      \ wiki software already maintains an accurate record of all contributions via\
      \ the history page.  Duplicating the information within an article will only\
      \ clutter the article, adding extraneous editorial information that is not of\
      \ interest to readers and degrading the article's quality.  If you are adding\
      \ information to a page that comes from another source (e.g., moved from another\
      \ wiki page or based on comments by another person), you can provide the source\
      \ with proper credit by using the \"Edit Summary\" field on the edit page.\n\
      </p><p>Some pages may incorrectly contain attribution or dates. Feel free to\
      \ remove these and note the attribution in the summary field of the edit page.\
      \ That way the information still shows up in the history tab. \n</p><p>This\
      \ rule does <i>not</i> apply to talk pages.  On talk pages (discussion pages)\
      \ you <i>should</i> use attribution to clarify the flow of discussion; simply\
      \ typing ~~~~ after your message will automatically insert your name and a timestamp.\
      \ \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Redundancy\">Redundancy</span><span\
      \ class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a\
      \ href=\"/edit/Liandri_Archives:Style_Guide?section=3\" title=\"Edit section:\
      \ Redundancy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n\
      <p>New information added to the wiki should not repeat or be redundant with\
      \ other information already on the site.  Adding content to the wiki is only\
      \ useful if the content is organized and presented in a way that makes it easy\
      \ for all readers to find the information.    This means that generally a topic\
      \ will have a <b>single</b> page (or a section of a page) where the topic is\
      \ discussed in full detail.  Other pages that discuss that topic should <b>not</b>\
      \ try to repeat the details, but should instead provide a <a href=\"/Help:Links\"\
      \ title=\"Help:Links\">link</a> to the page with the details.  Only information\
      \ that is directly relevant to a given page should be included on the page.\n\
      </p><p>There are several reasons why redundancy should be avoided.  First, if\
      \ a topic is discussed in detail on multiple different pages, then a reader\
      \ has to read all of those pages to be sure that he has read all the information.\
      \  Especially on a wiki, where different editors add information at different\
      \ times, multiple versions of the same information cannot be efficiently maintained.\
      \  <a href=\"/edit/Help:Templates?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Help:Templates\
      \ (page does not exist)\">Transclusions</a> should be used instead of copying\
      \ in cases where the same information needs to be shown on multiple pages. \
      \ Second, adding extraneous details makes a page long and difficult to read.\
      \  Only information of interest to almost all readers should be included: 90%\
      \ of the readers should not have to wade through uninteresting information just\
      \ so that 10% of readers can find the information.\n</p><p>Before adding a new\
      \ note to a page, editors should double check whether:\n</p>\n<ul><li> The information\
      \ is being added to the right page. Is this information directly relevant to\
      \ the page?  Is this where readers are likely to look for the information? \
      \ If the answer to either of these questions is \"no\" then add a link to the\
      \ appropriate page instead.</li>\n<li> The information being added in the right\
      \ section of the page.  The \"Notes\" section of a page is only for miscellaneous\
      \ information that does not fit anywhere else, and should not be used if there\
      \ is another section of the page that discusses the topic.</li>\n<li> The information\
      \ should be merged into another, existing paragraph or note. It is generally\
      \ better to add a few words to an existing sentence than to write a whole new\
      \ note that mostly repeats existing information.  Don't be afraid to revise\
      \ what someone else has written: wiki editors are supposed to modify content\
      \ written by other editors.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It is acceptable to write an article even if you do\
      \ not know all of the information necessary to complete the article.  However,\
      \ gaps in the article should <i>not</i> be filled in with with approximations\
      \ or best guesses.  It is better to have no information than to have inaccurate\
      \ information, because inaccuracies mislead readers and are hard to find and\
      \ correct.  Uncertain information, or points that need more followup, should\
      \ be moved to the discussion page where other editors can add their knowledge.\
      \  In cases where an approximation in the article is the only choice, the approximation\
      \ should be marked with a bold \"<b>(?)</b>\" to notify readers that the information\
      \ is currently not known.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Language\"\

      <p>Liandri Archives is written using American English, in particular following\
      \ grammar and spelling standards appropriate for printed text.  Colloquialisms,\
      \ slang, l33t speak, and other informal or casual styles are <b>not</b> acceptable.\
      \ We want the wiki to be a serious resource for people looking for information.\n\
      </p><p>Words should be spelled using the American English spelling, except for\
      \ terminology and proper nouns that originate from the Unreal series games;\
      \ game-specific words should always use the in-game spelling.  Similarly, capitalization\
      \ follows standard English rules, except in cases where a proper name or title\
      \ comes from an Unreal series game, in which case the game capitalization is\
      \ kept (e.g. <a href=\"/Na_Pali\" title=\"Na Pali\">Na Pali</a>).  More specifics\
      \ on spelling and capitalization are provided at <a href=\"/edit/Liandri_Archives:Spelling?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Liandri Archives:Spelling (page does not exist)\">Spelling</a>.\n\
      </p><p>Numbers should generally be written out as words if they are used as\
      \ part of a sentence and can be written out in one or two words. For statistics\
      \ and tables, however, it is proper for the numbers to always be in numerical\
      \ form.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Writing_Style\">Writing\

      <p>Liandri Archives content should be written in a style appropriate for an\
      \ encyclopedia.  Descriptions should be clear, concise, and authoritative; speculations\
      \ or uncertain facts should be avoided unless notated.  Articles should be written\
      \ for the wiki's readers, and should attempt to tell the readers what to expect\
      \ when they play the game.  Instruct and explain to the readers, and let the\
      \ encyclopedia center around them.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: No First Person\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h3>\n<p>One of the most common mistakes made by well-intentioned\
      \ editors is to provide information using a first-person point of view.  First-person\
      \ descriptions are typically used when an editor shares an example of something\
      \ that happened to them in-game to further illustrate or clarify a point.  An\
      \ example of first-person narration is \"When I entered the area I saw two titans\"\
      .  This writing style implies that the events only happened a single time (when\
      \ the editor was playing the game), and therefore does not provide the reader\
      \ with a meaningful description of what the reader should expect when he plays\
      \ the game.  Content submitted to an article in first-person will often be deleted\
      \ and moved to the article's talk page until someone can verify the information\
      \ and rewrite it.\n</p><p>Instead of first-person descriptions, wiki contributions\
      \ should use second-person or third-person.  An example of second-person is\
      \ \"When you enter the area you will see two titans\".  This style talks directly\
      \ to the reader.  Although less formal than third-person, second-person descriptions\
      \ can often be easier to write.  This sentence in third-person would be \"When\
      \ the player enters the area he will see two titans\". \n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

  wikitext:
    text: "The wiki '''Style Guide''' is designed to maintain consistency throughout\
      \ the site.  Since editors from all over the world make modifications and additions\
      \ to the wiki's articles, it is important for the project to have a uniform\
      \ format and style.  This article summarizes our recommended style guidelines,\
      \ that apply to all articles written on the site.  Articles that follow these\
      \ guidelines are more likely to be well-received by the rest of the community,\
      \ and will require other editors to spend less time cleaning up the articles.\n\
      \nThe style of [[Help:Namespaces#Talk Namespaces|talk pages]] is less formal\
      \ than that used for articles.  While most of these guidelines are still relevant\
      \ to talk pages, there are several differences that are noted as appropriate\
      \ below.\n\n==Content==\nThe purpose of the {{SITENAME}} is to provide encyclopedia-style\
      \ content describing the Unreal games.  All articles should be informative and\
      \ targeted at the site's audience.  Information that is only of interest to\
      \ the writer or to other editors should not be included in articles.  The article's\
      \ talk page is the place to discuss questions about the article's content or\
      \ style.\n\n===Attribution and Dates===\nDo not add any attributions (e.g.,\
      \ \"written by QAPete\") or dates (e.g., \"written on Feb. 14, 2007\") when\
      \ editing an article.  The wiki software already maintains an accurate record\
      \ of all contributions via the history page.  Duplicating the information within\
      \ an article will only clutter the article, adding extraneous editorial information\
      \ that is not of interest to readers and degrading the article's quality.  If\
      \ you are adding information to a page that comes from another source (e.g.,\
      \ moved from another wiki page or based on comments by another person), you\
      \ can provide the source with proper credit by using the \"Edit Summary\" field\
      \ on the edit page.\n\nSome pages may incorrectly contain attribution or dates.\
      \ Feel free to remove these and note the attribution in the summary field of\
      \ the edit page. That way the information still shows up in the history tab.\
      \ \n\nThis rule does ''not'' apply to talk pages.  On talk pages (discussion\
      \ pages) you ''should'' use attribution to clarify the flow of discussion; simply\
      \ typing <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> after your message will automatically insert\
      \ your name and a timestamp. \n\n===Redundancy===\nNew information added to\
      \ the wiki should not repeat or be redundant with other information already\
      \ on the site.  Adding content to the wiki is only useful if the content is\
      \ organized and presented in a way that makes it easy for all readers to find\
      \ the information.    This means that generally a topic will have a '''single'''\
      \ page (or a section of a page) where the topic is discussed in full detail.\
      \  Other pages that discuss that topic should '''not''' try to repeat the details,\
      \ but should instead provide a [[Help:Links|link]] to the page with the details.\
      \  Only information that is directly relevant to a given page should be included\
      \ on the page.\n\nThere are several reasons why redundancy should be avoided.\
      \  First, if a topic is discussed in detail on multiple different pages, then\
      \ a reader has to read all of those pages to be sure that he has read all the\
      \ information.  Especially on a wiki, where different editors add information\
      \ at different times, multiple versions of the same information cannot be efficiently\
      \ maintained.  [[Help:Templates#Transclusions|Transclusions]] should be used\
      \ instead of copying in cases where the same information needs to be shown on\
      \ multiple pages.  Second, adding extraneous details makes a page long and difficult\
      \ to read.  Only information of interest to almost all readers should be included:\
      \ 90% of the readers should not have to wade through uninteresting information\
      \ just so that 10% of readers can find the information.\n\nBefore adding a new\
      \ note to a page, editors should double check whether:\n* The information is\
      \ being added to the right page. Is this information directly relevant to the\
      \ page?  Is this where readers are likely to look for the information?  If the\
      \ answer to either of these questions is \"no\" then add a link to the appropriate\
      \ page instead.\n* The information being added in the right section of the page.\
      \  The \"Notes\" section of a page is only for miscellaneous information that\
      \ does not fit anywhere else, and should not be used if there is another section\
      \ of the page that discusses the topic.\n* The information should be merged\
      \ into another, existing paragraph or note. It is generally better to add a\
      \ few words to an existing sentence than to write a whole new note that mostly\
      \ repeats existing information.  Don't be afraid to revise what someone else\
      \ has written: wiki editors are supposed to modify content written by other\
      \ editors.\n\n===Unknown Information===\nIt is acceptable to write an article\
      \ even if you do not know all of the information necessary to complete the article.\
      \  However, gaps in the article should ''not'' be filled in with with approximations\
      \ or best guesses.  It is better to have no information than to have inaccurate\
      \ information, because inaccuracies mislead readers and are hard to find and\
      \ correct.  Uncertain information, or points that need more followup, should\
      \ be moved to the discussion page where other editors can add their knowledge.\
      \  In cases where an approximation in the article is the only choice, the approximation\
      \ should be marked with a bold \"'''(?)'''\" to notify readers that the information\
      \ is currently not known.\n\n==Language==\n{{SITENAME}} is written using American\
      \ English, in particular following grammar and spelling standards appropriate\
      \ for printed text.  Colloquialisms, slang, l33t speak, and other informal or\
      \ casual styles are '''not''' acceptable. We want the wiki to be a serious resource\
      \ for people looking for information.\n\nWords should be spelled using the American\
      \ English spelling, except for terminology and proper nouns that originate from\
      \ the Unreal series games; game-specific words should always use the in-game\
      \ spelling.  Similarly, capitalization follows standard English rules, except\
      \ in cases where a proper name or title comes from an Unreal series game, in\
      \ which case the game capitalization is kept (e.g. [[Na Pali]]).  More specifics\
      \ on spelling and capitalization are provided at [[Project:Spelling|Spelling]].\n\
      \nNumbers should generally be written out as words if they are used as part\
      \ of a sentence and can be written out in one or two words. For statistics and\
      \ tables, however, it is proper for the numbers to always be in numerical form.\n\
      \n==Writing Style==\n{{SITENAME}} content should be written in a style appropriate\
      \ for an encyclopedia.  Descriptions should be clear, concise, and authoritative;\
      \ speculations or uncertain facts should be avoided unless notated.  Articles\
      \ should be written for the wiki's readers, and should attempt to tell the readers\
      \ what to expect when they play the game.  Instruct and explain to the readers,\
      \ and let the encyclopedia center around them.\n\n===No First Person===\nOne\
      \ of the most common mistakes made by well-intentioned editors is to provide\
      \ information using a first-person point of view.  First-person descriptions\
      \ are typically used when an editor shares an example of something that happened\
      \ to them in-game to further illustrate or clarify a point.  An example of first-person\
      \ narration is \"When I entered the area I saw two titans\".  This writing style\
      \ implies that the events only happened a single time (when the editor was playing\
      \ the game), and therefore does not provide the reader with a meaningful description\
      \ of what the reader should expect when he plays the game.  Content submitted\
      \ to an article in first-person will often be deleted and moved to the article's\
      \ talk page until someone can verify the information and rewrite it.\n\nInstead\
      \ of first-person descriptions, wiki contributions should use second-person\
      \ or third-person.  An example of second-person is \"When you enter the area\
      \ you will see two titans\".  This style talks directly to the reader.  Although\
      \ less formal than third-person, second-person descriptions can often be easier\
      \ to write.  This sentence in third-person would be \"When the player enters\
      \ the area he will see two titans\". \n\n==Format==\nWiki formatting is used\
      \ to improve the legibility of an article. Bulleted lists, numeric lists, bolding,\
      \ italics, and coloring are all tools to help text \"pop out\" at the reader.\
      \  When properly used, these tools help the reader to quickly scan a page for\
      \ the key points, then focus on individual paragraphs of interest. For general\
      \ guidelines on how to make articles legible, see [http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html\
      \ \"How Users Read on the Web\"] by ''Jakob Nielsen''.\n\nGeneral information\
      \ on how to implement wiki formatting is provided at [[Help:Formatting|Formatting]]\
      \ (or an overview at [[Help:Quick Editing Guide|Quick Editing Guide]]).\n\n\
      ===Bold===\n* Bolding should be used for headings, subheadings, and article\
      \ names.  This is done automatically when using the wiki heading format (e.g.,\
      \ ==heading==).\n* Bold the article name the first time it appears in the page's\
      \ introductory sentence.  Any alternative names in the introductory sentence\
      \ should also be bolded. (e.g. \"'''Vandora''', also known as '''Pandora''',\
      \ is best known for being one of the Nali gods.\")\n* Bold the word or phrase\
      \ being defined in bulleted or numeric lists. (See [[Project:Deletion_Policy#Criteria\
      \ for Speedy Deletion|Criteria for Speedy Deletion]] for an example.)\n* Keywords\
      \ for which readers are likely to be scanning may be in bold for emphasis, but\
      \ this should be used sparingly.  \n* Avoid using bold formatting for general\
      \ emphasis.\n\n===Italics===\n* Italics should be used for the titles of books\
      \ and lengthy works.\n* Italics can be used for proper names (e.g., of places\
      \ or items) to clarify that the phrase is a proper name.\n* Italics can be used\
      \ for general emphasis, but should be used sparingly.\n\n===Emphasis===\n* Avoid\
      \ using ALL CAPS for emphasis.\n* Avoid bolding words for general emphasis,\
      \ unless giving crucial notice. (e.g. Do '''not''' install mods from unreputable\
      \ sources.)\n* Avoid using double emphasis, such as combining italics with quotation\
      \ marks. (e.g. \"''an example of double emphasis''\")\n* Do not over emphasize,\
      \ as each emphasis added will lessen the effect of other emphases and detract\
      \ from the appearance of the article.\n\n===Avoid Cluttering Links===\nCross\
      \ links between wiki pages are important navigational tools, allowing the reader\
      \ to easily follow up on interesting points and find more detailed information.\
      \  However, it is possible to fill a page with too many links.  More details\
      \ on how to create links and guidelines on their usage are provided on the [[Help:Links|Links]]\
      \ help page.\n\nLinks to other articles should only be created when they are\
      \ relevant to the content, and will be helpful and informative to the reader.\
      \  Creating too many links can distract the reader and make the article hard\
      \ to read; some readers are likely to pause on each link to determine whether\
      \ the link is of interest.  Be sure that any link you add will help readers\
      \ and be used by readers.  You should avoid creating duplicate links in an article.\
      \  A link can be repeated if it last appeared in a previous section (since many\
      \ readers will not read all sections of a page), but there is hardly ever a\
      \ reason to link to the same article more than once in the same section.\n\n\
      Cross-wiki links should be used sparingly, and only when the content of the\
      \ page or information pertaining to the page may be found on another wiki.\n\
