      <blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">During the years of the <a href=\"\
      /Human-Skaarj_War\" title=\"Human-Skaarj War\">Human/Skaarj war</a>, Earth and\
      \ the United Aligned Worlds formed the <a href=\"/New_Earth_Government\" title=\"\
      New Earth Government\">New Earth Government</a>, a single government that might\
      \ be more efficient at carrying out an interplanetary war. Deep space asteroid\
      \ mining became the choice means of financing the war, with raw materials easily\
      \ gained from within the Terran System.<br /><br />Mining was hard and the pay\
      \ very poor. The socialized working class grew more and more restless with their\
      \ working conditions and a war that seemed to never cease. Each day the <a href=\"\
      /Skaarj\" title=\"Skaarj\">Skaarj</a> invasion forces drew closer and few battles\
      \ were won. Riots began to break out, the most notable being the \"<a href=\"\
      /Green%27s_World_Rebellion\" title=\"Green's World Rebellion\">Green's World\
      \ Rebellion</a>\", where over three thousand miners joined in a riot that would\
      \ cost billions in damage.<br /><br />The Human/Skaarj war was brought to a\
      \ standstill during the '<a href=\"/7_Day_Siege\" title=\"7 Day Siege\">7 Day\
      \ Siege</a>' when Skaarj forces surrounded the Terran system and Earth itself\
      \ seemed doomed. All was made well when a crack team of NEG military specialists\
      \ were able to destroy the Skri'ith Class Dreadnaught 'Krujhlok', the Queen\
      \ Ship of the Skaarj forces. Confused by the loss of their <a href=\"/Skaarj_Queen\"\
      \ title=\"Skaarj Queen\">High Matriarch</a>, the Skaarj withdrew. Their unity\
      \ shattered by a well placed fusion detonator.<br /><br />The damage was done,\
      \ however. The NEG had largely ignored its internal social conditions while\
      \ waging an expensive and impossible war. More and more mining \"incidents\"\
      \ were being reported and cracking down seemed to have little effect.<br /><br\
      \ />NEG politicians determined that the best policy was not to stifle the violence,\
      \ but give it an outlet. In 2291, \"concentual murder\" was legalized. Under\
      \ NEG law, any two people could, under organized conditions, fight to the death.\
      \ The various mining conglomerates organized matches and small leagues to channel\
      \ aggression. The results were immidiate and successful.<br /><br />The leagues\
      \ escalated with money and promotions offered to victors. One insightful corporation,\
      \ the <a href=\"/Liandri_Mining_Corporation\" title=\"Liandri Mining Corporation\"\
      >Liandri Mining Corporation</a>, began to tri-cast fights and capitalize on\
      \ the primal form of entertainment. Much to the LMC's financial delight, the\
      \ tri-casts became more successful than the fights themselves; their popularity\
      \ growing with their brutality.<br /><br />Now it is 2341. 50 years after the\
      \ legalization of \"concentual murder.\" The LMC has found the \"Tournament\"\
      \ be significantly more popular than mining (now merely a token element of their\
      \ yearly profits). The \"Professional League\" has been formed. A cabal of the\
      \ most violent and skilled warriors. Each year, the LMC hosts the \"Grand Tournament,\"\
      \ the most brutal and popular of tri-cast events.<br /><br />You are a warrior\
      \ chosen to fight in the Grand Tournament. Perhaps you are a criminal, condemned\
      \ by the New Earth Government to fight to your death for the entertainment of\
      \ billions. Perhaps you are a mad man, bred by Liandri scientists to fight and\
      \ die without question. Perhaps you are a military specialist, fighting in the\
      \ Tournament to prove your abilities and win fame and fortune among the Aligned\
      \ Worlds. Perhaps you are a member of the <a href=\"/Necris\" title=\"Necris\"\
      >Necris</a>. An alien race until now rarely seen. Entering the Tournament to\
      \ prove your racial superiority.<br /><br />The current champion of the Tournament\
      \ is <a href=\"/Xan_Kriegor\" title=\"Xan Kriegor\">Xan Kriegor</a>. None have\
      \ seen his true form as he always battles in an enhanced cybernetic shell. (There\
      \ are no laws against cybernetic or chemical assistance.) Some say that Xan\
      \ is a Skaarj, others contend that he is an artifical intelligence constructed\
      \ by the LMC, still others argue that he is merely a highly skilled human. Either\
      \ way, you will have to fight many battles across several worlds to claim the\
      \ right of challenge against Xan...then, perhaps you will find out for yourself\
      \ what it is like to be Champion.</blockquote><div style=\"text-align: right;\

    text: "The '''Liandri Grand Tournament''' is the world-spanning Tournament sponsored\
      \ and tri-cast by the [[Liandri Mining Corporation]]. It evolved from the underground\
      \ leagues and matches used by mining companies to channel aggression on the\
      \ mining worlds.\n\n[[Image:Liandri_Corp.png|right|Official Liandri Logo]]\n\
      \n== Prior years ==\n{{QuoteSource|During the years of the [[Human-Skaarj War|Human/Skaarj\
      \ war]], Earth and the United Aligned Worlds formed the [[New Earth Government]],\
      \ a single government that might be more efficient at carrying out an interplanetary\
      \ war. Deep space asteroid mining became the choice means of financing the war,\
      \ with raw materials easily gained from within the Terran System.<br><br>Mining\
      \ was hard and the pay very poor. The socialized working class grew more and\
      \ more restless with their working conditions and a war that seemed to never\
      \ cease. Each day the [[Skaarj]] invasion forces drew closer and few battles\
      \ were won. Riots began to break out, the most notable being the \"[[Green's\
      \ World Rebellion]]\", where over three thousand miners joined in a riot that\
      \ would cost billions in damage.<br><br>The Human/Skaarj war was brought to\
      \ a standstill during the '[[7 Day Siege]]' when Skaarj forces surrounded the\
      \ Terran system and Earth itself seemed doomed. All was made well when a crack\
      \ team of NEG military specialists were able to destroy the Skri'ith Class Dreadnaught\
      \ 'Krujhlok', the Queen Ship of the Skaarj forces. Confused by the loss of their\
      \ [[Skaarj Queen|High Matriarch]], the Skaarj withdrew. Their unity shattered\
      \ by a well placed fusion detonator.<br><br>The damage was done, however. The\
      \ NEG had largely ignored its internal social conditions while waging an expensive\
      \ and impossible war. More and more mining \"incidents\" were being reported\
      \ and cracking down seemed to have little effect.<br><br>NEG politicians determined\
      \ that the best policy was not to stifle the violence, but give it an outlet.\
      \ In 2291, \"concentual murder\" was legalized. Under NEG law, any two people\
      \ could, under organized conditions, fight to the death. The various mining\
      \ conglomerates organized matches and small leagues to channel aggression. The\
      \ results were immidiate and successful.<br><br>The leagues escalated with money\
      \ and promotions offered to victors. One insightful corporation, the [[Liandri\
      \ Mining Corporation]], began to tri-cast fights and capitalize on the primal\
      \ form of entertainment. Much to the LMC's financial delight, the tri-casts\
      \ became more successful than the fights themselves; their popularity growing\
      \ with their brutality.<br><br>Now it is 2341. 50 years after the legalization\
      \ of \"concentual murder.\" The LMC has found the \"Tournament\" be significantly\
      \ more popular than mining (now merely a token element of their yearly profits).\
      \ The \"Professional League\" has been formed. A cabal of the most violent and\
      \ skilled warriors. Each year, the LMC hosts the \"Grand Tournament,\" the most\
      \ brutal and popular of tri-cast events.<br><br>You are a warrior chosen to\
      \ fight in the Grand Tournament. Perhaps you are a criminal, condemned by the\
      \ New Earth Government to fight to your death for the entertainment of billions.\
      \ Perhaps you are a mad man, bred by Liandri scientists to fight and die without\
      \ question. Perhaps you are a military specialist, fighting in the Tournament\
      \ to prove your abilities and win fame and fortune among the Aligned Worlds.\
      \ Perhaps you are a member of the [[Necris]]. An alien race until now rarely\
      \ seen. Entering the Tournament to prove your racial superiority.<br><br>The\
      \ current champion of the Tournament is [[Xan Kriegor]]. None have seen his\
      \ true form as he always battles in an enhanced cybernetic shell. (There are\
      \ no laws against cybernetic or chemical assistance.) Some say that Xan is a\
      \ Skaarj, others contend that he is an artifical intelligence constructed by\
      \ the LMC, still others argue that he is merely a highly skilled human. Either\
      \ way, you will have to fight many battles across several worlds to claim the\
      \ right of challenge against Xan...then, perhaps you will find out for yourself\
      \ what it is like to be Champion.|Unreal Universe by Brandon \"Green Marine\"\

      \ attempt to control violence among deep space miners, the [[New Earth Government]]\
      \ legalized no-holds-bared fighting. [[Liandri Mining Corporation]], working\

      The original [[Unreal Tournament]] takes place in 2293<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110210100647/http://www.unrealtournament2004.com/general/timeline.html\

      \ to the official Unreal timeline, although the game's introduction mentions\
      \ 2341. This article will use the more recently released date from the timeline.\
      \ After many years of being the champion (when the Tournament wasn't yet legal),\
      \ [[Xan Kriegor]] is finally defeated by [[Malcolm]] who entered as a member\
      \ of the [[Thunder Crash]] team. Malcolm remains champion for nine consecutive\
      \ years.\n\n[[Unreal Tournament 2003]] takes place in 2302. [[Gorge]] manages\
      \ to unseat [[Malcolm]] as the reigning champion. He is only champion for one\
      \ year.\n\n[[Unreal Tournament 2004]] takes place in 2303. [[Gorge]] is defeated\
      \ by the player. Notably, Xan Kriegor Mk. 3 tries to make a comeback but is\
      \ defeated by the player. [[Epic]] has yet to establish which character has\
      \ won in the official timeline. It is assumed that [[Jakob]] won due to the\
      \ fact that the default character skin in UT2004 is Jakob.\n\n[[Unreal Tournament\

      \ The Rites are won by [[Anubis]], who becomes the new emperor at a cost of\
      \ being forced to fight in the Grand Tournament.\n\nThere is a contradiction\
      \ in Unreal Championship 2: it states that Brock and Lauren both died and was\
