      \ Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n\
      </p><p>Emerging from a cave, you arrive at the peaceful Nali settlement of Glathriel\
      \ Village. There seems to be no trace of any Skaarj here - strange compared\
      \ to the infestation to which you have become accustomed. But not everything\
      \ is quite right...\n</p><p>You start in your boat, floating away from the foot\
      \ of an underground waterfall. As you pass through this cave, a <a href=\"/Gasbag\"\
      \ title=\"Gasbag\">Gasbag</a> sights you and comes down from above, but you\
      \ can ignore it because the boat soon pulls you away into a lake with another\
      \ small waterfall nearby, then stops at a jetty. It's night time now as you\
      \ arrive in the peaceful scene.\n</p><p>Upon climbing out of the boat on to\
      \ the jetty, you are on the lake banks at the foot of a gentle slope which curves\
      \ up to a bright-windowed house. In the other direction, a plank bridge acros\
      \ a section of the lake leads to a small island with a fishing hut on it. First\
      \ things first though, drop into the water.\n</p><p>Explore the floor of the\
      \ pool. You'll find two tough <a href=\"/Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a>\
      \ and a collapsed UMS drop box - whatever was in the box has gone. If you want\
      \ to, you can swim back into the cave and kill the Gasbag that saw you at the\
      \ start. Climbing out onto a rock ledge there, you will find a Nali skeleton\
      \ and wooden crates that reveal two Clips. Return to the lake.\n</p><p>Swim\
      \ to the jetty and climb out. On dry land, cross the plank bridge on the left\
      \ and approach the illuminated fishing hut. There, a <a href=\"/Nali\" title=\"\
      Nali\">Nali</a> stands looking out over the lake. Nearby, its fishing rod lies\
      \ on the ground alongside a <a href=\"/Combat_Assault_Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\">Combat Assault Rifle</a> - presumably the contents\
      \ of the collapsed UMS drop box you found underwater. Collect the CAR. You can\
      \ go into his shed if you want - you'll find nothing interesting but some captured\
      \ fish on his table.\n</p><p>Go back across the bridge and head up the path\
      \ towards the house. It climbs up the slope, passing the windows of the house,\
      \ towards a garden at the top. If you're unlucky you'll meet a large Manta here\
      \ (on harder skill settings in fact you'll find a <a href=\"/Manta_(enemy)\"\
      \ title=\"Manta (enemy)\"> Giant Manta</a> there). There's nothing useful in\
      \ the part of the garden the Manta came from, so go to the left and enter the\
      \ village (a <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit</a> can be collected from a plant box at the end of the first\
      \ house if you need it).\n</p><p>You will shortly emerge in a small village\
      \ courtyard, with houses round the side. To the right is a door into the first\
      \ house, and a little bit further along an opening into another grassy area.\
      \ The nearest house on the left (the one you saw from the jetty) can be accessed\
      \ by a door in the wall that faces this courtyard. At the far end of the courtyard\
      \ there is another house, a garden area and a place where the village seems\
      \ to continue round to the right. But stay at this end and ignore the doors\
      \ for now.\n</p><p>Go to the above mentioned entrance to the grassy area on\
      \ your right. Go through the gap between the houses and jump over a low fence\
      \ to get into a <a href=\"/Nali_Cow\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Nali Cow\"\
      >Nali Cow</a> pen. There, you can go behind the barn to find another Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit. When you're done exploring the area, return to the courtyard.\n</p><p>Go\
      \ through the doors into the house at this end of the courtyard (not the large\
      \ one that you could see from the jetty). Inside, a Nali meditates by his hearth.\
      \ Leave the Nali alone and go to the back of his hut to read the diary on his\
      \ table [1].\n</p><p>At the back of the house, you can explore a ladder that\
      \ leads up to an illuminated sleeping chamber in the attic, but you will not\
      \ find anything useful. Return to the ground floor.\n</p><p>You're done in this\
      \ house, so go outside and head for the far end of the courtyard. Where the\
      \ village seems to continue to the right, your passage is blocked by a piece\
      \ of smashed building which is impassable. However, there's another house to\
      \ investigate at this end of the courtyard and also a small garden area to the\
      \ left. Go into the garden area and smash the UMS drop box there to get a 50\
      \ bullet CAR Clip. Then, go into the house at this end of the courtyard. The\
      \ house is lit by a fireplace in the back right corner. There's a table on the\
      \ left with a diary [2] .\n</p><p>All is not right in this village. Before leaving\
      \ though, go up steps at the back into the sleeping chamber in the loft where\
      \ a chest between the beds contains <a href=\"/Bandages\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Bandages\">Bandages</a>. When you've done that, leave the house and\
      \ return to the courtyard.\n</p><p>Enter the third house, the large one that\
      \ you saw from the jetty. Within, a Nali bows before a statue aboard his mantelpiece.\
      \ Leave him alone and climb the staircase into his loft to locate and read the\
      \ diary on the back table [3].\n</p><p>Go downstairs and look around. You'll\
      \ see beneath the main staircase a further flight of steps going down into the\
      \ Nali's basement. Descend and enter the small room.\n</p><p>Raid containers\
      \ in the basement for a set of Bandages and a <a href=\"/Seed\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Seed\">Nali Fruit Seed</a>. Then, look around at the walls. In one\
      \ of the wall panels you will see a crack through to a chamber beyond. Shoot\
      \ that section of the wall to blow it open, then jump through the revealed hole\
      \ after the wall collapses to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\"\

      \ 1)''' is the fourth map in [[Unreal - Return to Na Pali|Unreal - Return to\
      \ Na Pali's]] single player game.\n\n; Author : [[Matthias Worch]]\n\n; Description\
      \ : The Glathriel village is infested with [[Skaarj]] and [[Krall]]s. This molests\
      \ the peace in the [[Nali]] village. Its old basements are filled with [[spinner|Spiders\
      \ that shoot out acid]], a new and annoying enemy for the campaign.\n{{clear}}\n\

      * [[Nali Healing Fruit]]\n* [[Bandages]]\n* [[Nali Fruit Seed]]\n* [[Combat\

      \ on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements may differ on other difficulty\
      \ settings.''\n\nEmerging from a cave, you arrive at the peaceful Nali settlement\
      \ of Glathriel Village. There seems to be no trace of any Skaarj here - strange\
      \ compared to the infestation to which you have become accustomed. But not everything\
      \ is quite right...\n\nYou start in your boat, floating away from the foot of\
      \ an underground waterfall. As you pass through this cave, a [[Gasbag]] sights\
      \ you and comes down from above, but you can ignore it because the boat soon\
      \ pulls you away into a lake with another small waterfall nearby, then stops\
      \ at a jetty. It's night time now as you arrive in the peaceful scene.\n\nUpon\
      \ climbing out of the boat on to the jetty, you are on the lake banks at the\
      \ foot of a gentle slope which curves up to a bright-windowed house. In the\
      \ other direction, a plank bridge acros a section of the lake leads to a small\
      \ island with a fishing hut on it. First things first though, drop into the\
      \ water.\n\nExplore the floor of the pool. You'll find two tough [[Devilfish]]\
      \ and a collapsed UMS drop box - whatever was in the box has gone. If you want\
      \ to, you can swim back into the cave and kill the Gasbag that saw you at the\
      \ start. Climbing out onto a rock ledge there, you will find a Nali skeleton\
      \ and wooden crates that reveal two Clips. Return to the lake.\n\nSwim to the\
      \ jetty and climb out. On dry land, cross the plank bridge on the left and approach\
      \ the illuminated fishing hut. There, a [[Nali]] stands looking out over the\
      \ lake. Nearby, its fishing rod lies on the ground alongside a [[Combat Assault\
      \ Rifle]] - presumably the contents of the collapsed UMS drop box you found\
      \ underwater. Collect the CAR. You can go into his shed if you want - you'll\
      \ find nothing interesting but some captured fish on his table.\n\nGo back across\
      \ the bridge and head up the path towards the house. It climbs up the slope,\
      \ passing the windows of the house, towards a garden at the top. If you're unlucky\
      \ you'll meet a large Manta here (on harder skill settings in fact you'll find\
      \ a [[Manta (enemy)| Giant Manta]] there). There's nothing useful in the part\
      \ of the garden the Manta came from, so go to the left and enter the village\
      \ (a [[Nali Healing Fruit]] can be collected from a plant box at the end of\
      \ the first house if you need it).\n\nYou will shortly emerge in a small village\
      \ courtyard, with houses round the side. To the right is a door into the first\
      \ house, and a little bit further along an opening into another grassy area.\
      \ The nearest house on the left (the one you saw from the jetty) can be accessed\
      \ by a door in the wall that faces this courtyard. At the far end of the courtyard\
      \ there is another house, a garden area and a place where the village seems\
      \ to continue round to the right. But stay at this end and ignore the doors\
      \ for now.\n\nGo to the above mentioned entrance to the grassy area on your\
      \ right. Go through the gap between the houses and jump over a low fence to\
      \ get into a [[Nali Cow]] pen. There, you can go behind the barn to find another\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit. When you're done exploring the area, return to the courtyard.\n\
      \nGo through the doors into the house at this end of the courtyard (not the\
      \ large one that you could see from the jetty). Inside, a Nali meditates by\
      \ his hearth. Leave the Nali alone and go to the back of his hut to read the\
      \ diary on his table [1].\n\nAt the back of the house, you can explore a ladder\
      \ that leads up to an illuminated sleeping chamber in the attic, but you will\
      \ not find anything useful. Return to the ground floor.\n\nYou're done in this\
      \ house, so go outside and head for the far end of the courtyard. Where the\
      \ village seems to continue to the right, your passage is blocked by a piece\
      \ of smashed building which is impassable. However, there's another house to\
      \ investigate at this end of the courtyard and also a small garden area to the\
      \ left. Go into the garden area and smash the UMS drop box there to get a 50\
      \ bullet CAR Clip. Then, go into the house at this end of the courtyard. The\
      \ house is lit by a fireplace in the back right corner. There's a table on the\
      \ left with a diary [2] .\n\nAll is not right in this village. Before leaving\
      \ though, go up steps at the back into the sleeping chamber in the loft where\
      \ a chest between the beds contains [[Bandages]]. When you've done that, leave\
      \ the house and return to the courtyard.\n\nEnter the third house, the large\
      \ one that you saw from the jetty. Within, a Nali bows before a statue aboard\
      \ his mantelpiece. Leave him alone and climb the staircase into his loft to\
      \ locate and read the diary on the back table [3].\n\nGo downstairs and look\
      \ around. You'll see beneath the main staircase a further flight of steps going\
      \ down into the Nali's basement. Descend and enter the small room.\n\nRaid containers\
      \ in the basement for a set of Bandages and a [[Seed|Nali Fruit Seed]]. Then,\
      \ look around at the walls. In one of the wall panels you will see a crack through\
      \ to a chamber beyond. Shoot that section of the wall to blow it open, then\
      \ jump through the revealed hole after the wall collapses to exit the level.\n\
      \n==Translator messages==\n#\"The Nightstalkers come again last night. We did\
      \ what we always do - lock the doors, douse the lights and pray that they don't\
      \ find us. But they forced their way into even more houses. I fear the night\
      \ when one when of those screams will be my own.\"\n#\"Maybe I should try to\
      \ get into the hideout. I don't care if it's already too crowded and can barely\
      \ support the sick - at least I'll die a peaceful death there.\"\n#\"I saw another\
      \ spider in the basement today. They squeeze through the crack in the wall and\
      \ take away whatever they want. I know I will have to close close the crack,\
      \ but how can I do it safely when any moment a spider could appear and threaten\
      \ my life?\"\n\n== Trivia ==\n* According to Worch, the name Glathriel comes\
      \ from the human hex in Jack Chalker's \"Well of Souls\" books.\n\n== External\
