      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>After a visit to the deepest darkest corners of the\
      \ <a href=\"/Chizra_-_Nali_Water_God\" title=\"Chizra - Nali Water God\">temple\
      \ of Chizra</a> the Nali water god, you arrive at the Ceremonial Chambers. These\
      \ dramatic rooms are now overrun by Skaarj and Slith; there is no rest for you\
      \ here.\n</p><p>You start in a sloping corridor beyond the stone seal. Proceed\
      \ to the small pillar ahead, on which there is an inscription [1].\n</p><p>Doesn't\
      \ that sound encouraging... anyway, proceed into the first room, staying on\
      \ the balcony above the pools below.\n</p><p>As you enter the room, a Nali Priest\
      \ runs away through a door on the left. Follow him quickly through a short corridor\
      \ until you arrive in another room similar to the first. The Nali sprints to\
      \ the far side, where a SkaarjScout who starts to your right may attempt to\
      \ assassinate him. Kill the Skaarj before it slaughters the Nali if you can.\
      \ The Nali is afraid of you now, so ignore it. Go into its corner and collect\
      \ the box of 50 Bullets and the can of 12 Eightballs there. Two Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit are also available on the far side of this area.\n</p><p>Coming through\
      \ the first short corridor between the two main rooms, you will have seen a\
      \ wooden ramp leading off to the left. Return now to this corridor and go part\
      \ of the way down the ramp. A SkaarjScout may see you from below and come running;\
      \ the <a href=\"/ASMD\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a> Combo\
      \ is fairly effective here. Having killed the Skaarj, return back up to the\
      \ top (don't go any furher down or open the gold door nearby yet). Return to\
      \ the first room now and take the other exit, i.e. the door that was to the\
      \ right as you came in, arriving in another short corridor. An opening on the\
      \ right here has a barred entrance with two Nali Priests and a SkaarjScout on\
      \ a wooden platform behind. This is tricky, but use the ASMD primary fire to\
      \ try and kill the Skaarj through the bars, because as soon as it sees you it\
      \ will try to assassinate the Nali. Note that if you ditch the Skaarj into the\
      \ water beneath the platform, he will soon appear coming up the ramp mentioned\
      \ above. Be alert.\n</p><p>Once again, having saved or otherwise the Nali, return\
      \ to the ramp down. Go to the gold door ahead and open it.\n</p><p>This next\
      \ section is not strictly necessary, but if you want some Eightballs, then go\
      \ through the door. You will be on a narrow beam over lava that circumnavigates\
      \ a structure in the middle of the room. Follow the beam round to the far side\
      \ of the room, where it enters the structure. From there you can jump to a pillar\
      \ in the middle on which there is an <a href=\"/Eightball_Gun\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Eightball Gun\">Eightball Gun</a> and a bunch of cans of 12 Eightballs.\
      \ As you do so however, a SkaarjScout will come through the gold door ahead.\
      \ Blow it up with your Eightball Gun, collect any remaining ammo, then return\
      \ to the beam. Follow it round and come back out through the door.\n</p><p>Now\
      \ descend the flight of steps to the barrels on the lower walkway. Collect a\
      \ box of 50 Bullets from the barrels, then follow the short corridor on the\
      \ left round to the right (an alcove on the left has barrels containing an <a\
      \ href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a> and\
      \ a Clip). You will find yourself by the pool under the second room, where you\
      \ will be attacked by a Slith.\n</p><p>Kill the Slith and look around. There\
      \ is a Nali Healing Fruit to the left. An entrance ahead (behind which a Nali\
      \ Priest summons you) is barred, and you don't want to go underwater yet, so\
      \ take the small corridor on the right through to the area under the first room.\
      \ Within the corridor, shoot open the barrels here to retrieve two Clips. As\
      \ you pass through the corridor a couple of Slith will probably see you from\
      \ within the water, so take advantage of your dry land position and spike 'em.\n\
      </p><p>In the area under the first room, there is another barred off entrance.\
      \ That leaves only one option, so ready your ASMD or <a href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"\
      Stinger\">Stinger</a> and go for a swim.\n</p><p>Underwater, two wide criss-crossing\
      \ tunnels connect the four main underwater areas. Some more Slith may see you\
      \ from the crossroads in the middle, so kill them too. You shouldn't need to\
      \ surface as you should still have some air in your <a href=\"/SCUBA_Gear\"\
      \ title=\"SCUBA Gear\">SCUBA Gear</a> from the previous level, so raid the barrels\
      \ to get two Clips and collect the Nali Healing Fruit from the floor of the\
      \ pool. Swim through the tunnel (which should now be clear, but kill any more\
      \ Slith that appear) to the water under the second main room, where there is\
      \ another Nali Healing Fruit and barrels that contain an ASMD Core. Then, turn\
      \ around again, and return to the underwater crossroads and take the tunnel\
      \ to the right (that is if you are facing the first room).\n</p><p>You will\
      \ come out in another underwater area, this time with a lever and two further\
      \ Nali Healing Fruit, beneath the wooden steps and ramp to the upper level.\
      \ Dive down and push the lever, and you will see bars sliding open at the far\
      \ end of the underwater area to reveal another lever behind barrels.\n</p><p>Before\
      \ going for the lever, though, your SCUBA Gear will be getting low at this point,\
      \ so swim up to near the surface and head for the shallow part of the pool above\
      \ the underwater tunnel. There is a small entrance here; swim through and surface\
      \ to get an <a href=\"/Automag\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a>\
      \ and replacement SCUBA Gear from a corpse. There is also more Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit underwater in this area.\n</p><p>Dive again and swim towards the furthest\
      \ end of the underwater tunnels. As you approach the barrels and lever, you\
      \ will pass beneath a pool below some raised wooden platforms above. Collect\
      \ the Nali Healing Fruit in this area along with a box of 50 Bullets from a\
      \ nearby barrel. Dive again and continue along the tunnel, shooting the barrels\
      \ (which contain 2 Clips) out of the way and pressing the lever. Shortly there\
      \ will be a loud 'crash' sound that will make you jump. What you have achieved\
      \ is to open all the barred entrances.\n</p><p>Swim through the network of tunnels.\
      \ Surface under the FIRST room (the one to the left as you reach the crossroads)\
      \ and go through the previously barred entrance here. You will find a wooden\
      \ platform at water level where there are two Slith and a Stinger by several\
      \ corpses. You can also collect Eightballs from a barrel near some Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit in a dark corner of the water pool, and there is further Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit elsewhere in the pool if you need it. You may also encounter a Fly here,\
      \ so kill it.\n</p><p>Now go to the second main room and take the previously\
      \ barred entrance here. Unless something unfortunate has happened, the Nali\
      \ Priest is still summonning you, but avoid him and first kill the Slith who\
      \ comes down from near a gold door. You may also have to kill another <a href=\"\
      /Fly\" title=\"Fly\">Fly</a> here.\n</p><p>Don't go through the door yet; there\
      \ are still some things you haven't covered. First, follow the Nali. He will\
      \ take you to near the gold door and point out the ASMD in the corner. Collect\
      \ it. Search the water pool as well and you will procure two Flares and some\
      \ more Nali Healing Fruit.\nRemember when you tried to rescue a pair of Nali\
      \ Priests from a SkaarjScout up above? Well, return to that area via the wooden\
      \ steps and ramp. If any Nali survived that you may still be able to hear them\
      \ summoning you. Arriving at the wooden platforms there, the Nali will point\
      \ you down the ramp to the left where there is an Assault Vest with a view of\
      \ the gold door. Collect the <a href=\"/Assault_Vest\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Assault Vest\">Assault Vest</a>, then return to the raised platform\
      \ and go down the ramp on the other side, past barrels with two Clips. You will\
      \ meet two Flies if you haven't killed them already. Continue and you will reach\
      \ another gold door with corpses and two barrels containing ASMD Cores nearby.\
      \ Open the door and step on to the balcony within, but don't jump off because\
      \ it's a bottomless pit&#160;:-) .\n</p><p>This balcony holds a SkaarjScout\
      \ and a Slith. Kill them both then go to the far end.\n</p><p>A Nali Priest\
      \ is meditating at a small shrine near a <a href=\"/Super_Health_Pack\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Super Health Pack\">Super Health Pack</a>. Hopefully the\
      \ Skaarj scared him and he is not blocking the way, but if he didn't notice\
      \ then he will be obstructing your access to the powerup. In that event, I hate\
      \ to say this, but shoot him (just one charge of the <a href=\"/Dispersion_Pistol\"\
      \ title=\"Dispersion Pistol\">Dispersion Pistol</a> please that's all!) to get\
      \ him moving. Grab the pack and read the log of the nearby human corpse [2].\n\
      </p><p>Return now - via any health and ammo you need that you might have left\
      \ behind - to the gold door you didn't enter before and open it. A Nali Priest\
      \ summons you. Follow the Nali and he will lead you up a wooden ramp to a platform\
      \ above. Watch and he will indicate two Clips on horizontal beams off to one\
      \ side, but as you reach the top of the ramp things turn nasty.\n</p><p>Bars\
      \ slam down and you are barred in. Three SkaarjScouts will appear one by one\
      \ at the far end of the room - I definitely recommend the Eightball Gun. When\
      \ all the Skaarj are dead, the bars will be withdrawn opening a doorway on the\
      \ raised platform, but before you go through it explore the ground floor of\
      \ the room. A small chamber has Clips and three crucified Nali that you should\
      \ put out of their misery. The rest of the room, the pool and the corridor by\
      \ which you came in together yield a Clip and several Nali Healing Fruit.\n\
      </p><p>Climb the ramp and go through the door. Follow a winding corridor - select\
      \ a non-explosive weapon as you go - until you reach a small room where a Skaarj\
      \ will make a charge for a Nali on a precipice. Try to stop the Skaarj.\n</p><p>Look\
      \ out through the doorway over the precipice; it is a deep natural chasm with\
      \ water and rocks at the bottom. It is a long way to fall, so press the lever\
      \ in the room and a hydraulic platform will come up on a rail to take you more\
      \ gently down.\n</p><p>You will arrive on wooden platforms at water level. Kill\
      \ the SkaarjScout that ambushes you here... these platforms don't really go\
      \ anywhere, so swim around behind the rock on to the next one. There is usually\
      \ a Nali Priest here but he does nothing, so ignore him.\n</p><p>Look along\
      \ to the far end of the chasm and you will see a platform with another Nali\
      \ Priest and a Slith. As soon as the Slith sees you, it will try to kill the\
      \ Nali, so you have two choices; give the Nali up for lost and take the direct\
      \ swimming route, or try to sneak up on the Slith by going round behind the\
      \ rock. Either way, swim over, kill the Slith and get out on to the platform.\
      \ Kill the other Slith that comes down from a raised area and then take a look\
      \ around.\n</p><p>It seems a dead end, but there is a large gun thing with a\
      \ lever nearby. Press the lever, and a harpoon shoots out and strikes the cliff\
      \ a long way up.\n</p><p>Ever fancied a spot of tightrope walking? Here's your\
      \ chance. Walk carefully up the rope and drop off on the ledge at the top. From\
      \ this ledge there is a plank up to the next one, so start climbing it. If you\
      \ are in need of any Eightballs there is a can of 12 on top of a rock below;\
      \ drop off the plank on to the rock, collect the ammo, then return up the tightrope.\
      \ Climb all the planks until you reach an entrance at the top.\n</p><p>At the\
      \ entrance, a Nali Priest summons you. Run straight past him and follow the\
      \ corridors and rooms until you reach a watery cave; the reason for ignoring\
      \ the Nali is the nasty SkaarjScout here whom you should kill. Raid the barrels\
      \ and crates here for an ASMD Core and Tarydium Shards, then return to the Nali.\n\
      </p><p>The Nali will point you on to a raft; step on board and he will join\
      \ you then use his telekinesis to start it moving. Ride the raft and climb out\
      \ at the far end of the cave, where there is a button and a barred entrance.\n\
      </p><p>Press the button and bars open to reveal a dead-end corridor with a tunnel\
      \ in the floor. Drop down the tunnel to exit the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"\

    text: "[[Image:CeremonialChambers.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]\n'''The Ceremonial Chambers'''\
      \ is the seventh map in [[Unreal|Unreal's]] single player game.\n; Author :\
      \ [[Myscha the Sled Dog]]\n; Description\n: Deep within the inner ceremonial\
      \ chambers of the temple of Chizra, [[Nali]] Water God, the atmosphere becomes\
      \ less serene and a little more paranoid. It seems that the [[Slith]] infestation\
      \ here is worse than ever, not to mention the increasing numbers of [[Skaarj]]\
      \ that lie in wait for the unsuspecting player. Right in front of the player,\
      \ the Nali priests begin to be slaughtered.\n{{clear}}\n==Weapons and Items==\n\

      \ Scout]]\n* [[Slith]]\n* [[Fly]]\n\n\n\n==Walkthrough==\nAfter a visit to the\
      \ deepest darkest corners of the [[Chizra - Nali Water God|temple of Chizra]]\
      \ the Nali water god, you arrive at the Ceremonial Chambers. These dramatic\
      \ rooms are now overrun by Skaarj and Slith; there is no rest for you here.\n\
      \nYou start in a sloping corridor beyond the stone seal. Proceed to the small\
      \ pillar ahead, on which there is an inscription [1].\n\nDoesn't that sound\
      \ encouraging... anyway, proceed into the first room, staying on the balcony\
      \ above the pools below.\n\nAs you enter the room, a Nali Priest runs away through\
      \ a door on the left. Follow him quickly through a short corridor until you\
      \ arrive in another room similar to the first. The Nali sprints to the far side,\
      \ where a SkaarjScout who starts to your right may attempt to assassinate him.\
      \ Kill the Skaarj before it slaughters the Nali if you can. The Nali is afraid\
      \ of you now, so ignore it. Go into its corner and collect the box of 50 Bullets\
      \ and the can of 12 Eightballs there. Two Nali Healing Fruit are also available\
      \ on the far side of this area.\n\nComing through the first short corridor between\
      \ the two main rooms, you will have seen a wooden ramp leading off to the left.\
      \ Return now to this corridor and go part of the way down the ramp. A SkaarjScout\
      \ may see you from below and come running; the [[ASMD]] Combo is fairly effective\
      \ here. Having killed the Skaarj, return back up to the top (don't go any furher\
      \ down or open the gold door nearby yet). Return to the first room now and take\
      \ the other exit, i.e. the door that was to the right as you came in, arriving\
      \ in another short corridor. An opening on the right here has a barred entrance\
      \ with two Nali Priests and a SkaarjScout on a wooden platform behind. This\
      \ is tricky, but use the ASMD primary fire to try and kill the Skaarj through\
      \ the bars, because as soon as it sees you it will try to assassinate the Nali.\
      \ Note that if you ditch the Skaarj into the water beneath the platform, he\
      \ will soon appear coming up the ramp mentioned above. Be alert.\n\nOnce again,\
      \ having saved or otherwise the Nali, return to the ramp down. Go to the gold\
      \ door ahead and open it.\n\nThis next section is not strictly necessary, but\
      \ if you want some Eightballs, then go through the door. You will be on a narrow\
      \ beam over lava that circumnavigates a structure in the middle of the room.\
      \ Follow the beam round to the far side of the room, where it enters the structure.\
      \ From there you can jump to a pillar in the middle on which there is an [[Eightball\
      \ Gun]] and a bunch of cans of 12 Eightballs. As you do so however, a SkaarjScout\
      \ will come through the gold door ahead. Blow it up with your Eightball Gun,\
      \ collect any remaining ammo, then return to the beam. Follow it round and come\
      \ back out through the door.\n\nNow descend the flight of steps to the barrels\
      \ on the lower walkway. Collect a box of 50 Bullets from the barrels, then follow\
      \ the short corridor on the left round to the right (an alcove on the left has\
      \ barrels containing an [[Automag]] and a Clip). You will find yourself by the\
      \ pool under the second room, where you will be attacked by a Slith.\n\nKill\
      \ the Slith and look around. There is a Nali Healing Fruit to the left. An entrance\
      \ ahead (behind which a Nali Priest summons you) is barred, and you don't want\
      \ to go underwater yet, so take the small corridor on the right through to the\
      \ area under the first room. Within the corridor, shoot open the barrels here\
      \ to retrieve two Clips. As you pass through the corridor a couple of Slith\
      \ will probably see you from within the water, so take advantage of your dry\
      \ land position and spike 'em.\n\nIn the area under the first room, there is\
      \ another barred off entrance. That leaves only one option, so ready your ASMD\
      \ or [[Stinger]] and go for a swim.\n\nUnderwater, two wide criss-crossing tunnels\
      \ connect the four main underwater areas. Some more Slith may see you from the\
      \ crossroads in the middle, so kill them too. You shouldn't need to surface\
      \ as you should still have some air in your [[SCUBA Gear]] from the previous\
      \ level, so raid the barrels to get two Clips and collect the Nali Healing Fruit\
      \ from the floor of the pool. Swim through the tunnel (which should now be clear,\
      \ but kill any more Slith that appear) to the water under the second main room,\
      \ where there is another Nali Healing Fruit and barrels that contain an ASMD\
      \ Core. Then, turn around again, and return to the underwater crossroads and\
      \ take the tunnel to the right (that is if you are facing the first room).\n\
      \nYou will come out in another underwater area, this time with a lever and two\
      \ further Nali Healing Fruit, beneath the wooden steps and ramp to the upper\
      \ level. Dive down and push the lever, and you will see bars sliding open at\
      \ the far end of the underwater area to reveal another lever behind barrels.\n\
      \nBefore going for the lever, though, your SCUBA Gear will be getting low at\
      \ this point, so swim up to near the surface and head for the shallow part of\
      \ the pool above the underwater tunnel. There is a small entrance here; swim\
      \ through and surface to get an [[Automag]] and replacement SCUBA Gear from\
      \ a corpse. There is also more Nali Healing Fruit underwater in this area.\n\
      \nDive again and swim towards the furthest end of the underwater tunnels. As\
      \ you approach the barrels and lever, you will pass beneath a pool below some\
      \ raised wooden platforms above. Collect the Nali Healing Fruit in this area\
      \ along with a box of 50 Bullets from a nearby barrel. Dive again and continue\
      \ along the tunnel, shooting the barrels (which contain 2 Clips) out of the\
      \ way and pressing the lever. Shortly there will be a loud 'crash' sound that\
      \ will make you jump. What you have achieved is to open all the barred entrances.\n\
      \nSwim through the network of tunnels. Surface under the FIRST room (the one\
      \ to the left as you reach the crossroads) and go through the previously barred\
      \ entrance here. You will find a wooden platform at water level where there\
      \ are two Slith and a Stinger by several corpses. You can also collect Eightballs\
      \ from a barrel near some Nali Healing Fruit in a dark corner of the water pool,\
      \ and there is further Nali Healing Fruit elsewhere in the pool if you need\
      \ it. You may also encounter a Fly here, so kill it.\n\nNow go to the second\
      \ main room and take the previously barred entrance here. Unless something unfortunate\
      \ has happened, the Nali Priest is still summonning you, but avoid him and first\
      \ kill the Slith who comes down from near a gold door. You may also have to\
      \ kill another [[Fly]] here.\n\nDon't go through the door yet; there are still\
      \ some things you haven't covered. First, follow the Nali. He will take you\
      \ to near the gold door and point out the ASMD in the corner. Collect it. Search\
      \ the water pool as well and you will procure two Flares and some more Nali\
      \ Healing Fruit.\nRemember when you tried to rescue a pair of Nali Priests from\
      \ a SkaarjScout up above? Well, return to that area via the wooden steps and\
      \ ramp. If any Nali survived that you may still be able to hear them summoning\
      \ you. Arriving at the wooden platforms there, the Nali will point you down\
      \ the ramp to the left where there is an Assault Vest with a view of the gold\
      \ door. Collect the [[Assault Vest]], then return to the raised platform and\
      \ go down the ramp on the other side, past barrels with two Clips. You will\
      \ meet two Flies if you haven't killed them already. Continue and you will reach\
      \ another gold door with corpses and two barrels containing ASMD Cores nearby.\
      \ Open the door and step on to the balcony within, but don't jump off because\
      \ it's a bottomless pit :-) .\n\nThis balcony holds a SkaarjScout and a Slith.\
      \ Kill them both then go to the far end.\n\nA Nali Priest is meditating at a\
      \ small shrine near a [[Super Health Pack]]. Hopefully the Skaarj scared him\
      \ and he is not blocking the way, but if he didn't notice then he will be obstructing\
      \ your access to the powerup. In that event, I hate to say this, but shoot him\
      \ (just one charge of the [[Dispersion Pistol]] please that's all!) to get him\
      \ moving. Grab the pack and read the log of the nearby human corpse [2].\n\n\
      Return now - via any health and ammo you need that you might have left behind\
      \ - to the gold door you didn't enter before and open it. A Nali Priest summons\
      \ you. Follow the Nali and he will lead you up a wooden ramp to a platform above.\
      \ Watch and he will indicate two Clips on horizontal beams off to one side,\
      \ but as you reach the top of the ramp things turn nasty.\n\nBars slam down\
      \ and you are barred in. Three SkaarjScouts will appear one by one at the far\
      \ end of the room - I definitely recommend the Eightball Gun. When all the Skaarj\
      \ are dead, the bars will be withdrawn opening a doorway on the raised platform,\
      \ but before you go through it explore the ground floor of the room. A small\
      \ chamber has Clips and three crucified Nali that you should put out of their\
      \ misery. The rest of the room, the pool and the corridor by which you came\
      \ in together yield a Clip and several Nali Healing Fruit.\n\nClimb the ramp\
      \ and go through the door. Follow a winding corridor - select a non-explosive\
      \ weapon as you go - until you reach a small room where a Skaarj will make a\
      \ charge for a Nali on a precipice. Try to stop the Skaarj.\n\nLook out through\
      \ the doorway over the precipice; it is a deep natural chasm with water and\
      \ rocks at the bottom. It is a long way to fall, so press the lever in the room\
      \ and a hydraulic platform will come up on a rail to take you more gently down.\n\
      \nYou will arrive on wooden platforms at water level. Kill the SkaarjScout that\
      \ ambushes you here... these platforms don't really go anywhere, so swim around\
      \ behind the rock on to the next one. There is usually a Nali Priest here but\
      \ he does nothing, so ignore him.\n\nLook along to the far end of the chasm\
      \ and you will see a platform with another Nali Priest and a Slith. As soon\
      \ as the Slith sees you, it will try to kill the Nali, so you have two choices;\
      \ give the Nali up for lost and take the direct swimming route, or try to sneak\
      \ up on the Slith by going round behind the rock. Either way, swim over, kill\
      \ the Slith and get out on to the platform. Kill the other Slith that comes\
      \ down from a raised area and then take a look around.\n\nIt seems a dead end,\
      \ but there is a large gun thing with a lever nearby. Press the lever, and a\
      \ harpoon shoots out and strikes the cliff a long way up.\n\nEver fancied a\
      \ spot of tightrope walking? Here's your chance. Walk carefully up the rope\
      \ and drop off on the ledge at the top. From this ledge there is a plank up\
      \ to the next one, so start climbing it. If you are in need of any Eightballs\
      \ there is a can of 12 on top of a rock below; drop off the plank on to the\
      \ rock, collect the ammo, then return up the tightrope. Climb all the planks\
      \ until you reach an entrance at the top.\n\nAt the entrance, a Nali Priest\
      \ summons you. Run straight past him and follow the corridors and rooms until\
      \ you reach a watery cave; the reason for ignoring the Nali is the nasty SkaarjScout\
      \ here whom you should kill. Raid the barrels and crates here for an ASMD Core\
      \ and Tarydium Shards, then return to the Nali.\n\nThe Nali will point you on\
      \ to a raft; step on board and he will join you then use his telekinesis to\
      \ start it moving. Ride the raft and climb out at the far end of the cave, where\
      \ there is a button and a barred entrance.\n\nPress the button and bars open\
      \ to reveal a dead-end corridor with a tunnel in the floor. Drop down the tunnel\
      \ to exit the level.\n\n==Translator Messages==\n# \"The inner ceremonial chambers.\
