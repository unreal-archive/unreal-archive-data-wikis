      \ 08:25, 8 August 2007 (EDT)\n\nWe definitely don't need to give planets that\
      \ don't have more than a one sentence mention in any game a lot of space. I\
      \ think you're idea is a good one, let's break the page up into games where\
      \ the planets are mentioned, and then have each game section have a subsection\
      \ called \"Minor Planets\" that only lists the planets that don't get much mention.\
      \ Additionally, we should probably only create individual pages for planets\
      \ that actually have enough information to warrant that. Probably 99% of the\
      \ planets should just be described on this page. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]]\

      \ ages ago, and I think I found that Abbadon is the original (I guess) name\
      \ used in UC, and Purgatory is the name used in UT2003. As I said, looked it\
      \ up ages ago, so I don't remember for sure if that's really the case. [[User:Retodon8|Retodon8]]\

      \ This] video, at 04:20, also mentions Purgatory. I have no idea where I read\
      \ \"Abbadon\" for the planet name anymore, so we should probably just remove\
      \ it. [[User:Retodon8|Retodon8]] 17:14, 30 October 2007 (EDT)\n\n==Sanctuary==\n\

      \ 15 September 2007 (EDT)\n\n:It's possible they're different planets with the\
      \ same name, or are the same planet, but no concrete evidence is given. --[[User:Dark\
      \ Pulse|Dark Pulse]] 18:38, 16 September 2007 (EDT)\n\n:Would it be best if\
      \ UC and UT2003/2004 be separated into different categories? Some of the homeworld\
      \ descriptions sound like they are from the Unreal Championship manual vs the\
      \ UT2004 team descriptions. Although some of them match. --[[User:Miko101|Miko101]]\
      \ 18:21, 19 September 2007 (EDT)\n\nThe more I've been thinking about it, the\
      \ less I think that the planet from UT2004 even needs it's own page. There is\
      \ nothing \"stellar\" or special about it... So, for now, let's move all the\
      \ of the current Sanctuary content somewhere else and then put a note on the\
      \ Sanctuary page that it is for the Unreal 2 walkthrough only. I'll try to get\
      \ more confirmation on whether these two planets are in any way related from\
      \ Jim Brown in the mean time. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 00:48, 20 September\
      \ 2007 (EDT)\n\nI talked to Jim Brown and they are not the same planet. Someone\
      \ should move ahead with not having every planet in UT2004 direct to it's own\
      \ page. --[[User:Sir Brizz|Sir Brizz]] 00:12, 1 November 2007 (EDT)\n\n==Whisper==\n\
