      \ title=\"Liandri Archives:Helping Out\">Helping Out</a> page has some ideas.\
      \  You do not need to get any pre-approval for your idea or otherwise ask for\

      \ that your contribution has been revised, remember that this is part of the\
      \ wiki process.  Each article is a fully collaborative effort, and any editor\
      \ can revise any part of the page.  The most common revisions are to fix typos\

      \ pages.\n</p><p>If your contribution is substantially altered or even removed\
      \ and you do not understand why, you should start by looking at the page history\
      \ (click the \"history\" tab at the top of the page) and see what was provided\
      \ as an edit summary.  The editor(s) who altered your contribution should have\
      \ given a brief explanation that appears in the page history.  You may also\
      \ want to check the talk page (click the \"discussion\" tab) and see if a more\
      \ detailed explanation was given there.  If you still don't understand what\
      \ was done, <a href=\"#Editing_a_Discussion_Page\">add a question</a> on the\
      \ discussion page; the editor who made the change should reply the next time\

      \ you can make any changes you want to the sandbox page (within reason: obscenities\

      /Special:RecentChanges\" title=\"Special:RecentChanges\">Recent Changes</a>\
      \ page with a lot of redundant entries.  Other editors will find it much easier\
      \ to keep track of what you have done if all the edits are done at the same\
      \ time.  Of course, there will inevitably be times when you realize right after\
      \ hitting the \"Save page\" button that you forgot to do something; by all means,\
      \ edit the page again to take care of anything that was overlooked the first\
      \ time.  Also, if you are spending hours editing a page, you may wish to save\
      \ your progress a few times along the way; this is completely acceptable.\n\

      <p>Previewing the page is often the most important step of the process, especially\
      \ for new editors.  The section of the page that you are editing will be shown\
      \ exactly as it will appear on the wiki page.  Read over your entry and be sure\
      \ that everything is complete <i>before</i> hitting the \"Save page\" button.\
      \  Make any necessary changes, and preview the page again.  Only once you're\
      \ sure all your editing is done should you hit the \"Save page\" button.\n</p>\n\

      \ typographical or grammatical errors.</li>\n<li> adjusting the layout of the\
      \ page or formatting of a section.</li>\n<li> adjusting the size or placement\

      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Every article has its own discussion page (also frequently\
      \ called a talk page) where you can ask questions, make suggestions, or discuss\
      \ corrections. Click the \"discussion\" tab at the top of the page to reach\
      \ it.  If the \"discussion\" tab is red, it has not yet been created; all editors\
      \ are welcome to create talk pages whenever they are needed.\n</p><p>Follow\
      \ the same <a href=\"#Quick_Summary\">steps</a> used to edit the main article\
      \ page.  Some differences between article pages and talk pages are:\n</p>\n\
      <ul><li> You should always <b>sign your message</b> using --~~~~.  When you\
      \ save the page, the site will automatically convert the four tildes (the ~~~~\
      \ part) into your username and the current time (the preview will also show\
      \ what your converted signature will look like).</li>\n<li> <b>New topics</b>\
      \ should be started at the bottom of the page, using a level two header for\
      \ the title (==Title==).</li>\n<li> A <b>shortcut</b> for creating a new topic\
      \ is the \"+\" tab (right next to the \"edit\" tab at the top of any discussion\
      \ page). Clicking this button automatically adds a new section to the bottom\
      \ of the discussion page.  Instead of the \"Edit summary\" box there is a \"\
      Subject/headline\" box which should be filled in with an appropriate title (e.g.,\
      \ \"How do I beat the Titan?\")</li>\n<li> When commenting on a subject, your\
      \ comments should be <b>placed below</b> any other comments on the subject.\
      \ When directly replying to another editor's message, place your comments below\
      \ everyone else that has replied to that person.</li>\n<li> If you are replying\
      \ to a previous editor, you should <b>indent</b> your comments using a single\
      \ colon (:) at the start of your paragraph.  (Or if the previous editor's comments\
      \ were indented, use one more colon than the previous editor).</li></ul>\n<h2><span\
      \ class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reverting_Edits\">Reverting Edits</span><span class=\"\
      mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/edit/Help:Editing_Pages?section=7\"\
      \ title=\"Edit section: Reverting Edits\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are times when you may need to reverse a set\
      \ of edits and restore a page to a previous version.  Examples are:\n</p>\n\
      <ul><li> You just made a major mistake with your last edit and don't know how\
      \ else to fix it.</li>\n<li> You notice that someone has <a href=\"/Liandri_Archives:Vandalism\"\
      \ title=\"Liandri Archives:Vandalism\">vandalized</a> a page and you want to\
      \ clean up the vandalism.</li></ul>\n<p>Note, however, that you should be cautious\
      \ about reverting any edits made in good faith by another editor.  An explanation\
      \ must be provided if you revert another editor's work (in the <a href=\"/Help:Edit_Summary\"\
      \ title=\"Help:Edit Summary\">edit summary</a> or on the talk page).  Reverting\
      \ can lead to edit wars instead of constructive improvements to the wiki.  See\
      \ <a href=\"/edit/Liandri_Archives:Consensus?redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"\
      Liandri Archives:Consensus (page does not exist)\">Consensus</a> for more information.\n\
      </p><p>The wiki automatically keeps a record of all changes that have been made\
      \ to every article.  Therefore, it is easy to access any previous version of\
      \ the page.  To restore an article to its previous state:\n</p>\n<ol><li> Click\
      \ on the \"history\" tab at the top of the article.</li>\n<li> Identify the\
      \ version you would like to use, and click on its date/time information.  This\
      \ will open that version of the page in your browser.</li>\n<li> Click on the\
      \ \"edit\" tab that appears on that version of the page.  Note that a red box\
      \ appears at the top of the edit page to warn you that you are editing an out\
      \ of date version of the page.</li>\n<li> Provide a reason for this change in\
      \ the edit summary.</li>\n<li> Click \"Save page\".</li></ol>\n<h2><span class=\"\

      \ the [[Special:Recentchanges|Recent Changes]] page with a lot of redundant\
      \ entries.  Other editors will find it much easier to keep track of what you\
      \ have done if all the edits are done at the same time.  Of course, there will\
      \ inevitably be times when you realize right after hitting the \"Save page\"\
      \ button that you forgot to do something; by all means, edit the page again\
      \ to take care of anything that was overlooked the first time.  Also, if you\
      \ are spending hours editing a page, you may wish to save your progress a few\
      \ times along the way; this is completely acceptable.\n\n==Previewing the Page==\n\
      Previewing the page is often the most important step of the process, especially\
      \ for new editors.  The section of the page that you are editing will be shown\
      \ exactly as it will appear on the wiki page.  Read over your entry and be sure\
      \ that everything is complete ''before'' hitting the \"Save page\" button. \
      \ Make any necessary changes, and preview the page again.  Only once you're\
      \ sure all your editing is done should you hit the \"Save page\" button.\n\n\
      ==Minor Edits==\nA checkmark should be placed in the \"This is a minor edit\"\
      \ checkbox for any edits that do not fundamentally change the information available\
      \ on the page.  Examples of minor edits include:\n* fixing typographical or\
      \ grammatical errors.\n* adjusting the layout of the page or formatting of a\
      \ section.\n* adjusting the size or placement of images.\n* adding [[Project:Categories|Categories]]\
      \ or other navigational tools to a page.\n\n==Editing a Discussion Page==\n\
      Every article has its own discussion page (also frequently called a talk page)\
      \ where you can ask questions, make suggestions, or discuss corrections. Click\
      \ the \"discussion\" tab at the top of the page to reach it.  If the \"discussion\"\
      \ tab is red, it has not yet been created; all editors are welcome to create\
      \ talk pages whenever they are needed.\n\nFollow the same [[#Quick Summary|steps]]\
      \ used to edit the main article page.  Some differences between article pages\
      \ and talk pages are:\n* You should always '''sign your message''' using <nowiki>--~~~~</nowiki>.\
      \  When you save the page, the site will automatically convert the four tildes\
      \ (the <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> part) into your username and the current time (the\
      \ preview will also show what your converted signature will look like).\n* '''New\
      \ topics''' should be started at the bottom of the page, using a level two header\
      \ for the title (==Title==).\n* A '''shortcut''' for creating a new topic is\
      \ the \"+\" tab (right next to the \"edit\" tab at the top of any discussion\
      \ page). Clicking this button automatically adds a new section to the bottom\
      \ of the discussion page.  Instead of the \"Edit summary\" box there is a \"\
      Subject/headline\" box which should be filled in with an appropriate title (e.g.,\
      \ \"How do I beat the Titan?\")\n* When commenting on a subject, your comments\
      \ should be '''placed below''' any other comments on the subject. When directly\
      \ replying to another editor's message, place your comments below everyone else\
      \ that has replied to that person.\n* If you are replying to a previous editor,\
      \ you should '''indent''' your comments using a single colon (:) at the start\
      \ of your paragraph.  (Or if the previous editor's comments were indented, use\
      \ one more colon than the previous editor).\n\n== Reverting Edits ==\nThere\
      \ are times when you may need to reverse a set of edits and restore a page to\
      \ a previous version.  Examples are:\n* You just made a major mistake with your\
      \ last edit and don't know how else to fix it.\n* You notice that someone has\
      \ [[Project:Vandalism|vandalized]] a page and you want to clean up the vandalism.\n\
      \nNote, however, that you should be cautious about reverting any edits made\
      \ in good faith by another editor.  An explanation must be provided if you revert\
      \ another editor's work (in the [[Help:Edit Summary|edit summary]] or on the\
      \ talk page).  Reverting can lead to edit wars instead of constructive improvements\
      \ to the wiki.  See [[Project:Consensus|Consensus]] for more information.\n\n\
      The wiki automatically keeps a record of all changes that have been made to\
      \ every article.  Therefore, it is easy to access any previous version of the\
      \ page.  To restore an article to its previous state:\n# Click on the \"history\"\
      \ tab at the top of the article.\n# Identify the version you would like to use,\
      \ and click on its date/time information.  This will open that version of the\
      \ page in your browser.\n# Click on the \"edit\" tab that appears on that version\
      \ of the page.  Note that a red box appears at the top of the edit page to warn\
      \ you that you are editing an out of date version of the page.\n# Provide a\
      \ reason for this change in the edit summary.\n# Click \"Save page\".\n\n==\
