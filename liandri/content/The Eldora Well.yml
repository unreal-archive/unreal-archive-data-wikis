      \ walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.</i>\n</p><p>Your leap of faith has\
      \ led you into the depths of the Eldora Well. This underground complex is puzzlingly\
      \ devoid of water considering the number of pools on the planet's surface. Maybe\
      \ you can restore the water then find a way to move on from here.\n</p><p>You\
      \ start at the foot of the well shaft, in a small chest-high water pool. Ahead,\
      \ a step leads out into the dry well tunnels. Climb out of the gunge.\n</p><p>As\
      \ you step into the storage tunnels, bars close behind you as a <a href=\"/Tentacle\"\
      \ title=\"Tentacle\">Tentacle</a> attacks from the roof to the right. Kill it\
      \ then look around - a tunnel leads ahead deeper into the complex while containers\
      \ lie in dead ends to either side and a human corpse lies ahead. Read his log\
      \ [1].\n</p><p>When you're done, destroy the barrels on the left to get a Clip\
      \ and a <a href=\"/Flare\" title=\"Flare\">Flare</a>. Go along to the other\
      \ end of this cross-tunnel to get two <a href=\"/Nali_Healing_Fruit\" title=\"\
      Nali Healing Fruit\">Nali Healing Fruit</a>, a Clip and an <a href=\"/Automag\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Automag\">Automag</a>, plus a wooden crate by\
      \ a Nali skeleton that reveals a <a href=\"/Flashlight\" title=\"Flashlight\"\
      >Flashlight</a>. When you're fully kitted out, go off down the large tunnel\
      \ that goes deeper into the dark complex. You will be approaching another junction;\
      \ watch out for the <a href=\"/Krall\" title=\"Krall\">Krall</a> asleep at the\
      \ junction who wakes up and makes an attack as you approach.\n</p><p>At the\
      \ junction you are at another cross-tunnel, this time with two parallel tunnels\
      \ ahead that go deeper still into the complex. Make a left and collect a <a\
      \ href=\"/Stinger\" title=\"Stinger\">Stinger</a> there then open a nearby barrel\
      \ for an ASMD Core. Set off down the left of the two tunnels but be prepared\
      \ for a <a href=\"/Gasbag\" title=\"Gasbag\">Gasbag</a> that comes down from\
      \ the mouth of a small vertical shaft above. Kill the Gasbag and also the Krall\
      \ that comes running when it hears the fight. When they are both dead, go along\
      \ to the next cross tunnel (if you are feeling thorough you can go back and\
      \ round via the parallel tunnel to kill another Gasbag that may come out of\
      \ another vertical shaft). Either way, go down to the end.\n</p><p>In this cross\
      \ tunnel, a barrel at the left end contains a box of 10 Flak Shells, while two\
      \ barrels at the right end reveal a Clip and 40 Tarydium Shards. Collect the\
      \ ammo then enter the next tunnel from this area.\n</p><p>This last tunnel leads\
      \ you to a dark lift shaft upwards with a lever at the bottom and barred off\
      \ water below. Press the lever to call the lift. When it has descended, step\
      \ on it and ride it to the top. You will be in a pyramidal chamber where you\
      \ will meet a KrallElite. Kill it then take stock of the room; ahead is a large\
      \ double door which is currently locked. To either side and behind you are three\
      \ large control wheel valves. There are barrels in the corners. First, destroy\
      \ the barrels - you will find a Clip, a Flare and 40 Tarydium Shards.\n</p><p>When\
      \ you have collected the gear, visit the three control wheel alcoves. Each valve\
      \ will start a stream of water flowing and once all three valves are activated,\
      \ chains either side of the door will very slowly begin to move. There follows\
      \ a brief period of wait while the chains rise, during which you will have to\
      \ deal with two <a href=\"/Fly\" title=\"Fly\">Flies</a> that come out of ceiling\
      \ holes. After a short while, the doors open, allowing you access to the long\
      \ corridor beyond. Go out into the corridor towards more doors at the far end,\
      \ which open as you approach to reveal an outdoor area which is lit by dim blue\
      \ dusk light.\n</p><p>Step outside and kill the <a href=\"/Brute\" title=\"\
      Brute\">Brute</a> on guard there. You will also find a <a href=\"/Manta\" title=\"\
      Manta\">Manta</a> swooping round - kill that too. When both are dead, take a\
      \ look around. It's a closed outdoor area with another well shaft in the middle\
      \ (which is now full). In the middle of the area are a Nali Healing Fruit and\
      \ a <a href=\"/Flak_Cannon\" title=\"Flak Cannon\">Flak Cannon</a>. Collect,\
      \ then go clockwise round the large rock at the left-hand end of the area, past\
      \ another Nali Healing Fruit, arriving at a corpse which carries a log [2].\n\
      </p><p>Shoot open a wooden crate here for a <a href=\"/Shield_Belt\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Shield Belt\">Shield Belt</a> then re-emerge behind the\
      \ well. In this vicinity, UMS drop boxes can be shot open to reveal a <a href=\"\
      /Combat_Assault_Rifle\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Combat Assault Rifle\"\
      >Combat Assault Rifle</a> and a <a href=\"/Grenade_Launcher\" title=\"Grenade\
      \ Launcher\">Grenade Launcher</a>. You can also go back round the front and\
      \ shoot open the wooden crates for a box of 50 Bullets.\n</p><p>When you're\
      \ ready, go to the well entrance and jump in. Swim down to the bottom, arriving\
      \ in the now submerged well tunnels. Watch out as you descend for a <a href=\"\
      /Devilfish\" title=\"Devilfish\">Devilfish</a> lurking in ambush beneath a pair\
      \ of crossbars.\n</p><p>Shoot open a wooden crate at the bottom of the well\
      \ for 40 Tarydium Shards. Continue along the tunnel, killing another Devilfish,\
      \ and reaching another wooden crate with another 40 Tarydium Shards inside.\
      \ Kill another Devilfish that attacks here.\n</p><p>Follow the tunnel to its\
      \ conclusion - there's a Nali Healing Fruit on the way if you need it - and\
      \ you will arrive at the bottom of a vertical shaft. Swim up through some damaged\
      \ bars above, and you will realise that you are in the lift shaft you went up\
      \ before, which is now full of water and blocked at the top by the lift. A <a\
      \ href=\"/Slith\" title=\"Slith\">Slith</a> is circling round above, so use\
      \ your Combat Assault Rifle to destroy it. Take a moment to swim up and surface\
      \ beneath the lift to recharge your Marine <a href=\"/SCUBA_Gear\" title=\"\
      SCUBA Gear\">SCUBA Gear</a>.\n</p><p>When you're fully charged, descend again\
      \ and go towards where you started the level. At the first cross tunnel, you\
      \ will notice that bars have been removed from a wall entrance to the left.\
      \ You need to go through said bars, but you may first want to visit the rest\
      \ of this area to destroy a lurking Slith and Devilfish and to collect anything\
      \ you may have left behind.\n</p><p>Go through the bars. The tunnel beyond follows\
      \ round to the right, before reaching another vertical shaft above with broken\
      \ bars across it. Go through the gap but make sure you first kill the Slith\
      \ lurking just beyond.\n</p><p>Swim up the vertical shaft. It is blocked off\
      \ further up by a barrier but look out as you swim upwards for an entrance to\
      \ one side. Kill the Slith lurking within the tunnel beyond then go along said\
      \ tunnel's length. Barrels along the way reveal a Clip. At the far end, swim\
      \ up to the top of a long vertical tunnel and climb out. Your respite does not\
      \ last for long. Following a short stretch of dry tunnel, you soon have to plunge\
      \ into water again, shooting a submerged wooden crate for an ASMD Core. A short\
      \ distance later, you are above the blockage in the main vertical shaft you\
      \ were in before. Swim up and climb out of the well entrance at the top.\n</p><p>You\
      \ come out on a small dirt canyon plateau beside a lake. Watch out for a Gasbag\
      \ that descends from above, then look around. On this plateau, you can go behind\
      \ a large rock for two Nali Healing Fruit, an ASMD Core and an <a href=\"/ASMD\"\
      \ class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"ASMD\">ASMD</a>. Having done that, you can descend\
      \ wooden steps to a jetty on the lakeside where a barrel reveals a Clip. A boat\
      \ is tied to the jetty. Plunge into the water for a UMS drop box containing\
      \ 10 Grenades. Then, climb out on to the jetty and step aboard the boat. It\
      \ floats on the current into a cave leading into the cliffs. Shortly, you exit\
      \ the level.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translator_messages\"\

      \n''This walkthrough was completed on Medium difficulty. Creature and item placements\
      \ may differ on other difficulty settings.''\n\nYour leap of faith has led you\
      \ into the depths of the Eldora Well. This underground complex is puzzlingly\
      \ devoid of water considering the number of pools on the planet's surface. Maybe\
      \ you can restore the water then find a way to move on from here.\n\nYou start\
      \ at the foot of the well shaft, in a small chest-high water pool. Ahead, a\
      \ step leads out into the dry well tunnels. Climb out of the gunge.\n\nAs you\
      \ step into the storage tunnels, bars close behind you as a [[Tentacle]] attacks\
      \ from the roof to the right. Kill it then look around - a tunnel leads ahead\
      \ deeper into the complex while containers lie in dead ends to either side and\
      \ a human corpse lies ahead. Read his log [1].\n\nWhen you're done, destroy\
      \ the barrels on the left to get a Clip and a [[Flare]]. Go along to the other\
      \ end of this cross-tunnel to get two [[Nali Healing Fruit]], a Clip and an\
      \ [[Automag]], plus a wooden crate by a Nali skeleton that reveals a [[Flashlight]].\
      \ When you're fully kitted out, go off down the large tunnel that goes deeper\
      \ into the dark complex. You will be approaching another junction; watch out\
      \ for the [[Krall]] asleep at the junction who wakes up and makes an attack\
      \ as you approach.\n\nAt the junction you are at another cross-tunnel, this\
      \ time with two parallel tunnels ahead that go deeper still into the complex.\
      \ Make a left and collect a [[Stinger]] there then open a nearby barrel for\
      \ an ASMD Core. Set off down the left of the two tunnels but be prepared for\
      \ a [[Gasbag]] that comes down from the mouth of a small vertical shaft above.\
      \ Kill the Gasbag and also the Krall that comes running when it hears the fight.\
      \ When they are both dead, go along to the next cross tunnel (if you are feeling\
      \ thorough you can go back and round via the parallel tunnel to kill another\
      \ Gasbag that may come out of another vertical shaft). Either way, go down to\
      \ the end.\n\nIn this cross tunnel, a barrel at the left end contains a box\
      \ of 10 Flak Shells, while two barrels at the right end reveal a Clip and 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards. Collect the ammo then enter the next tunnel from this area.\n\
      \nThis last tunnel leads you to a dark lift shaft upwards with a lever at the\
      \ bottom and barred off water below. Press the lever to call the lift. When\
      \ it has descended, step on it and ride it to the top. You will be in a pyramidal\
      \ chamber where you will meet a KrallElite. Kill it then take stock of the room;\
      \ ahead is a large double door which is currently locked. To either side and\
      \ behind you are three large control wheel valves. There are barrels in the\
      \ corners. First, destroy the barrels - you will find a Clip, a Flare and 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards.\n\nWhen you have collected the gear, visit the three control\
      \ wheel alcoves. Each valve will start a stream of water flowing and once all\
      \ three valves are activated, chains either side of the door will very slowly\
      \ begin to move. There follows a brief period of wait while the chains rise,\
      \ during which you will have to deal with two [[Fly|Flies]] that come out of\
      \ ceiling holes. After a short while, the doors open, allowing you access to\
      \ the long corridor beyond. Go out into the corridor towards more doors at the\
      \ far end, which open as you approach to reveal an outdoor area which is lit\
      \ by dim blue dusk light.\n\nStep outside and kill the [[Brute]] on guard there.\
      \ You will also find a [[Manta]] swooping round - kill that too. When both are\
      \ dead, take a look around. It's a closed outdoor area with another well shaft\
      \ in the middle (which is now full). In the middle of the area are a Nali Healing\
      \ Fruit and a [[Flak Cannon]]. Collect, then go clockwise round the large rock\
      \ at the left-hand end of the area, past another Nali Healing Fruit, arriving\
      \ at a corpse which carries a log [2].\n\nShoot open a wooden crate here for\
      \ a [[Shield Belt]] then re-emerge behind the well. In this vicinity, UMS drop\
      \ boxes can be shot open to reveal a [[Combat Assault Rifle]] and a [[Grenade\
      \ Launcher]]. You can also go back round the front and shoot open the wooden\
      \ crates for a box of 50 Bullets.\n\nWhen you're ready, go to the well entrance\
      \ and jump in. Swim down to the bottom, arriving in the now submerged well tunnels.\
      \ Watch out as you descend for a [[Devilfish]] lurking in ambush beneath a pair\
      \ of crossbars.\n\nShoot open a wooden crate at the bottom of the well for 40\
      \ Tarydium Shards. Continue along the tunnel, killing another Devilfish, and\
      \ reaching another wooden crate with another 40 Tarydium Shards inside. Kill\
      \ another Devilfish that attacks here.\n\nFollow the tunnel to its conclusion\
      \ - there's a Nali Healing Fruit on the way if you need it - and you will arrive\
      \ at the bottom of a vertical shaft. Swim up through some damaged bars above,\
      \ and you will realise that you are in the lift shaft you went up before, which\
      \ is now full of water and blocked at the top by the lift. A [[Slith]] is circling\
      \ round above, so use your Combat Assault Rifle to destroy it. Take a moment\
      \ to swim up and surface beneath the lift to recharge your Marine [[SCUBA Gear]].\n\
      \nWhen you're fully charged, descend again and go towards where you started\
      \ the level. At the first cross tunnel, you will notice that bars have been\
      \ removed from a wall entrance to the left. You need to go through said bars,\
      \ but you may first want to visit the rest of this area to destroy a lurking\
      \ Slith and Devilfish and to collect anything you may have left behind.\n\n\
      Go through the bars. The tunnel beyond follows round to the right, before reaching\
      \ another vertical shaft above with broken bars across it. Go through the gap\
      \ but make sure you first kill the Slith lurking just beyond.\n\nSwim up the\
      \ vertical shaft. It is blocked off further up by a barrier but look out as\
      \ you swim upwards for an entrance to one side. Kill the Slith lurking within\
      \ the tunnel beyond then go along said tunnel's length. Barrels along the way\
      \ reveal a Clip. At the far end, swim up to the top of a long vertical tunnel\
      \ and climb out. Your respite does not last for long. Following a short stretch\
      \ of dry tunnel, you soon have to plunge into water again, shooting a submerged\
      \ wooden crate for an ASMD Core. A short distance later, you are above the blockage\
      \ in the main vertical shaft you were in before. Swim up and climb out of the\
      \ well entrance at the top.\n\nYou come out on a small dirt canyon plateau beside\
      \ a lake. Watch out for a Gasbag that descends from above, then look around.\
      \ On this plateau, you can go behind a large rock for two Nali Healing Fruit,\
      \ an ASMD Core and an [[ASMD]]. Having done that, you can descend wooden steps\
      \ to a jetty on the lakeside where a barrel reveals a Clip. A boat is tied to\
      \ the jetty. Plunge into the water for a UMS drop box containing 10 Grenades.\
      \ Then, climb out on to the jetty and step aboard the boat. It floats on the\
      \ current into a cave leading into the cliffs. Shortly, you exit the level.\n\
      \n==Translator messages==\n#\"LOG: J. Walden: No sign of anyone yet. It's getting\
      \ dark again. Going to camp out near the well until morning. Well seems empty,\
      \ there may be a way out. maybe I'll find the others.\"\n#\"LOG: S. Brown: The\

      \ to an intermission with a view of the plateau. The player records a log entry.\n\
