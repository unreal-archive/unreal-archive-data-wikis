      \ who reaches the goal score first or has the highest score when time limit\
      \ hits. The gametype's name also is its main twist: You can betray the members\
      \ of your current team by killing them with the alternate firing mode of your\
      \ InstaGib gun. After successful betrayal, the player takes the team pot and\
      \ becomes a rouge for 30 seconds. The rouge's former team mates can get payback\
      \ during that period. After avoiding payback or when getting fragged by a former\
      \ team mate, the player becomes a freelancer again and will join the next team.\n\
