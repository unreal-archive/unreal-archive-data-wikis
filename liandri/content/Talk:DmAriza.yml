      \ and draw the map over the screenshot. Blends and fades are really easy to\

      \ spent quite some time brightening/darkening areas to in-/decrease the suggested\
      \ height). After the whole level has been coloured in (and higher-level floor\
      \ are made semi-transparent and such), I place the icons. The icons can be exported\
      \ from UEd (I believe the texture package is HUDContent, but I could be wrong).\
      \ The texture can then be imported in Photoshop, after which individual icons\
      \ can be selected and copied to the map. --<a href=\"/User:Kaithofis\" title=\"\

      \ Another thing is that every part of a floor has been outlined, which adds\

      \ As you go up in the minimap you can see the the floors become more transcluent,\

      \ (The others I uploaded were actually made by someone else for CompaMut.) The\
      \ general idea when coloring these layouts is to use different colors for different\

      \ heights on the same major level. Lava, slime and water get a different color,\
      \ blocking structures are holes in the layer for that plane. Where multiple\

      \ though: Always give your uploaded images descriptive names, like \"DmAriza-Pickups\"\
      \ or \"DmArize-Layout\" or something similar. The map name is a must for map-related\
      \ images. -<a href=\"/User:Wormbo\" title=\"User:Wormbo\">Wormbo</a> 16:53,\

      \ described here... I see that instead of the outlines, shadows are used, but\
      \ I'm not sure if smooth shadows can be used with SVG... With outlines, I see\
      \ the point. About the names, well I din't name it at all because I'll re-upload\
      \ it with proper pickup icons and spawn icons. Just to get my Photoshop here.\
