    text: "The '''GES Bio Rifle''' ('''G'''reen '''E'''xploding '''S'''hit) is a weapon\
      \ that is present in all of the [[Unreal]] series games with the exception of\
      \ [[Unreal 2]].\n\nThe Bio Rifle has been a staple of the series and thus has\
      \ remained unchanged for the most part. Primary fire will launch a series of\
      \ small, green blobs which will stick to anything or explode on contact with\
      \ another player, while secondary fire will gather the blobs into a much larger\
      \ and usually slower-moving charge, but direct contact with a fully-charged\
      \ shot is universally fatal, regardless of health and armor, and it is without\
      \ question the strongest non-superweapon or non-vehicle attack in the series.\n\

      }}\nA testament to creative recycling, this weapon uses a volatile [[Tarydium]]\
      \ waste for ammunition. The highly unstable nature of this waste makes the GES\
      \ BioRifle more powerful than its Tarydium-loaded cousin, the [[Stinger]]. It\
      \ also helps or hurts that this can be used as a mine, depending on who is standing\
      \ on it.\n\n;Primary Fire\n: Tarydium sludge projectiles explode on contact\
      \ with living tissue and adhere to most other surfaces for a short time before\
      \ exploding.\n;Secondary Fire\n: Hold down the secondary fire button to launch\
      \ a larger, slower, more powerful glob of sludge. The longer you hold down the\
      \ secondary fire button, the larger the glob (up to 5 kg). Unlike later versions,\
      \ the first GES BioRifle automatically fires when the barrel is full, therefore\
      \ making the weapon harder to use.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Unreal Tournament==\n{{Infobox\

      \ weapons in the Tournament. Loved by some, loathed by others, the BioRifle\
      \ has long been the subject of debate over its usefulness. Some Tournament purists\
      \ argue that the delayed detonation of the mutagenic sludge, coupled with the\
      \ ability to quickly carpet an area with the highly toxic substance, has reduced\
      \ the weapon to the equivalent of a minefield, a barbaric and cowardly weapon\
      \ employed during past human conflicts. Proponents of the weapon argue that\
      \ it enhances the tactical capabilities of defensive combatants, allowing participants\
      \ to cover multiple choke points more efficiently. Despite the debate, the weapon\
      \ remains historically accurate, providing rapid-fire wide-area coverage in\
      \ primary firing mode, and a single-fire variable payload secondary firing mode.\

      \ as far as they did in UT2003, while a fully-charged glob travels considerably\
      \ less far.  A direct hit of a fully-charged shot does up to 210 damage, an\
