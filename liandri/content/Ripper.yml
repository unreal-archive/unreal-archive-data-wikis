      \ hit an opponent with [[splash damage]] rather then full head on damage. Beware\
      \ that if timed wrong or if an enemy is using EMP, the blade will explode in\

      \ alternate fire and pressing primary fire can turn the explosive spinning saw\

      \ a player steps into its senor range. Making the Ripjack easily an effective\

      \ 2|adrenaline]] will veer the disk toward an opponent and even if it misses\
      \ can stick in the ground near them and catch them off guard. Rip Mines can\
      \ also be used as weapons to deter chasers by firing the mine in front of you\
      \ and jumping over it before it strikes the ground and leaving a nasty surprise\
      \ of an unwary attacker. The same EMP tactic can be used with Rip Mines but\
      \ can also be used against you as well so be wary of EMP.\n{{clear}}\n\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n\
      [[Category:Projectile weapons]]\n\n== Notes ==\nThe Ripper did not return in\
      \ any later incarnations of Unreal Tournament and there was no replacement weapon.\
      \ Instead, all remaining weapons were shifted down one inventory slot. This\
      \ allowed the [[Sniper Rifle]] and [[Redeemer]] to have separate weapon slots.\n\
      \nIt is possible to download an unofficial version of the Ripjack for UT2004.\
      \ It works the same way than the UC2 version, but it is impossible to use the\
      \ land mine function of the weapon. You can find the file in the FileFront.\n\
      \nThe UT2004 mod [[Chaos UT2]] has a similar weapon, the C.U.T.T.E.R.. Primary\
      \ fire remained the same while secondary tilts the weapon 90° to the left before\
      \ firing, causing the blade to shatter on impact, each fragment dealing damage\
      \ to nearby targets.\n\nThere are various Ripper mutators for [[UT3]], including\
      \ Ripper Lite, which is a straight \"carbon copy\" of the Ripper."
