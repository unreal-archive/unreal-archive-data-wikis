      <p>The <b>Unreal Tournament Preservation Group</b> (UTPG) is a group of programmers\
      \ and server admins from the UT community. UTPG was not impressed when they\
      \ saw how many exploits and bugs players were dealing with on Patch 436 (including\
      \ the infamous DDOS exploit and the creeping ping bug in Windows 2000 Server).\
      \ UTPG approached <a href=\"/Epic_Games\" title=\"Epic Games\">Epic</a> and\
      \ asked if they could have the source code of Patch 436 and build unofficial\
      \ patches. <a href=\"/Epic_Games\" title=\"Epic Games\">Epic</a> agreed, but\
      \ on the condition that the patches was to be completely optional, and players\
      \ MUST install Patch 436 before applying the UTPG Patches. UTPG agreed, and\
      \ <a href=\"/Epic_Games\" title=\"Epic Games\">Epic Games</a> gave them the\
      \ source code plus the fixes they made for Patch 436 to bundle them into the\
      \ new UTPG patch. Some other fixes and exploits were fixed as well such as the\
      \ ucc buffer overflow exploit and the backslashes and mutators in the status\
      \ query replies bug. They also implemented a new team information query into\
      \ the protocol, making it easier to identify team information at a much easier\
      \ and less daunting task for the <a href=\"/Unreal_Engine\" title=\"Unreal Engine\"\
      >Unreal Engine</a>. Once UTPG bundled up the fixes, they sent a copy to <a href=\"\
      /Epic_Games\" title=\"Epic Games\">Epic</a> to verify the release. They was\
      \ amazed, and gave them a copy of the <a href=\"/edit/Unreal_Installer?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Unreal Installer (page does not exist)\">Unreal Installer</a>.\
      \ UTPG then remade the setup with the <a href=\"/edit/Unreal_Installer?redlink=1\"\
      \ class=\"new\" title=\"Unreal Installer (page does not exist)\">Unreal Installer</a>,\
      \ and numbered the patch 440. This was only the start of he UTPG patches. Many\
      \ UT players thought this patch was excellent, and demanded more bugs to be\
      \ fixed. UTPG then started finding, and patching up the exploits and fixes that\
      \ they and the UT community were still having. Two months later, the new patch\
      \ was complete, and was numbered as Patch 451. This patch fixed 36 bugs and\
      \ exploits in total, but it did not come without consequences. The way UTPG\
      \ modified the <a href=\"/UnrealEd\" title=\"UnrealEd\">UnrealEd</a>, the second\
      \ you loaded it up, an error message would come up, making the <a href=\"/UnrealEd\"\
      \ title=\"UnrealEd\">UnrealEd</a> unusable. Another bug was that sometimes the\
      \ client and the server would crash if invalid classes were loaded. About 10\
      \ months later or so, they released Patch 451b. It fixed that invalid classes\
      \ bug, and the <a href=\"/UnrealEd\" title=\"UnrealEd\">UnrealEd</a> crash...well,\
      \ somewhat. The <a href=\"/UnrealEd\" title=\"UnrealEd\">UnrealEd</a> was still\
      \ not fully functional, as in you couldn't move the camera around the <a href=\"\
      /UnrealEd\" title=\"UnrealEd\">editor</a>, and left and right did the exact\
      \ same command, selecting the properties of the highlighted BSP brush or terrain,\
      \ making it impossible to create or edit levels. The only was to fix this problem\
      \ was to downgrade to Patch 436 or Patch 440, or by simply making a backup of\
      \ your UT folder before upgrading. Anyway, about a year or so later, UTPG combined\
      \ Patch 451 with Patch 451b, for an easier installer proccess.\n</p><p>One interesting\
      \ feature in the changelog, however, was that patch 436 labeled as patch 435\
      \ in some areas, yet some other parts of the readme still said \"Compatible\
      \ with servers running Patch 436 or higher\". It is uncertain if this is a typo\
      \ or if <a href=\"/Epic_Games\" title=\"Epic Games\">Epic</a> told UTPG to label\
      \ Patch 436 that way.\n</p><p>UTPG has not been active since October 2004. They\
      \ had plans on making Patch 451b onto Mac OS and Mac OSX, but they have never\
      \ discussed about anything since their last post on October, 2004.\n</p><p>Their\
      \ last post says the following:\n</p>\n<hr />\n<p><i>Yes, we are still alive\
      \ and working. Who would have thought getting an MD5 patch across 3 OS's would\
