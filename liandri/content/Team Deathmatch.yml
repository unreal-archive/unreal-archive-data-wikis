  title: "Team Deathmatch"
  text:
    text: "<p>See also <a href=\"/Deathmatch\" title=\"Deathmatch\">Deathmatch</a>.\n\
      </p><p>Team Deathmatch, or TDM, is a <a href=\"/Gametype\" class=\"mw-redirect\"\
      \ title=\"Gametype\">gametype</a> which is exactly the same as Deathmatch except\
      \ that players are on a team (usually Blue vs. Red).  This concept of a team,\
      \ combined with the rules of deathmatch, are the core of all other gametypes;\
      \ the difference being added objectives like \"<a href=\"/Capture_the_Flag\"\
      \ title=\"Capture the Flag\">Capture the Flag</a>\" or \"<a href=\"/Onslaught\"\
      \ title=\"Onslaught\">Destroy the Power Core</a>.\"  Team Deathmatch, like Deathmatch\
      \ itself, has been with the UT series since the beginning, and is likely to\
      \ remain in any future versions of the game.\n</p><p>In TDM, the primary objective\
      \ is to amass more frags than the opposing team.  To determine the winning team,\
      \ the total frags (kills minus suicides) of each player on a team are added\
      \ together and compared to the other team's frags; the team with the higher\
      \ fragcount wins.  This method means that a single awesome player can often\
      \ carry a team, or conversely if teams are fairly even, a single weak player\
      \ can drag the rest down.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Map_Layout_and_Tactics\"\

      \ title=\"Edit section: Map Layout and Tactics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\"\
      >]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Maps are rarely made specifically for Team Deathmatch\
      \ because TDM can be played on DM maps, and so a DM map will reach a larger\
      \ audience.  However, those that are targeted towards TDM are often larger than\
      \ DM maps (but still smaller than maps for most other gametypes).  An average\
      \ playercount of about 8-16 is normal, but occasionally maps are made for 4-24\
      \ players.  Maps which support more than 24 players are rare because of the\
      \ immense size and the resulting time they take to create and the time they\
      \ take to download.\n</p><p>Because of the size difference, TDM maps tend to\
      \ be more open than cramped.  This means that <a href=\"/Hitscan\" class=\"\
      mw-redirect\" title=\"Hitscan\">hitscan</a> weapons are often dominant.  Also,\
      \ \"team tactics\" are supported which means that players often travel in groups\
      \ for security and firepower.  Often one player will use a sniper, shock rifle,\
      \ or minigun while the other will typically use one of the other weapons to\
      \ provide a balance between hitscan and semi-spam.  The down side of this supportive\
      \ method is that traveling too closely can result in splash damage effecting\
      \ multiple teammates.\n</p><p>Like in Deathmatch, most TDM maps are set inside\
      \ or in a closed area, with a wide variety of themes.  No vehicles or turrets\
      \ are supported.  Adrenaline is on and the translocator is off.  <a href=\"\
      /Instagib\" title=\"Instagib\">Instagib</a> is fairly popular for TDM.\n</p>\n\

      <p>TDM maps usually don't have superweapons, but when they do it's usually in\
      \ a difficult-to-reach spot.  Depending on the size of the map, there will usually\
      \ be abouto 6-9 weapon types.  Players usually spawn near weapons, but spawnpoints\
      \ are also usually fairly far from each other and in somewhat protected areas\
      \ (which mainly means that you probably won't spawn in the middle of an open\
      \ floor).  Spawnpoints are not team-specific.\n</p><p>Usually the number of\
      \ hitscan weapons is approximately the same as the number of spam weapons. \
      \ Common weapons include all standard \"deathmatch\" weapons.  Low-level powerups\
      \ are common and usually easy to find, but more powerful ones like the UDamage,\
      \ Big Keg-O'-Health, and Supershield are either difficult to find or not implemented\
      \ at all (usually smaller maps will not include them, but larger maps will).\n\
